                        <p>What does it say about the state of US intelligence 
                          in the late nineteen-eighties and early ninety-nineties 
                          that two top counterintellgence officials-- Aldrich 
                          Ames in the CIA's anti-Soviet counterintelligence and 
                          Robert Phillip Hanssen in the FBI Soviet counterintelligence-- 
                          were moles for the Russian Intelligence Service? Under 
                          such circumstances, who controlled the recruitments 
                          the CIA and FBI were making during this period? </p>
                        <p><b>ANSWER:</b> </p>
                        <p>James Jesus Angleton, the chief of the CIA's counterintelligence 
                          staff from in 1953 to 1974, principal concern was not 
                          with &quot;moles&quot; per se, but with the inherent 
                          vulnerability of intelligence services to systematic 
                          deception. To him, &quot;moles&quot; were a means to 
                          this end if, and only if, they were in a position to 
                          provide timely feedback to an adversary about what channels 
                          his intelligence service were monitoring and how it 
                          is was interpreting the data it was intercepting. With 
                          such a feedback loop in place, he believed perfect deception 
                          was possible. Imagine, he suggested, a wife, attempting 
                          to deceiving her husband and using his psychiatrist 
                          as her feedback source. By bribing the psychiatrist 
                          to tell her on an ongoing basis how her husband was 
                          interpreting her lies and deceptions, she would be able 
                          to modify them, elaborating on those stories which he 
                          believed and discarding or altering those stories which 
                          he doubted. Through this trial and error process, she 
                          could continue to fit her deception perfectly to what 
                          her husband believed. &quot;The deceived becomes his 
                          own deceiver&quot; in Angleton's example. (You might 
                          recall Woody Allen used such a similar device to seduce 
                          Julia Roberts in the movie Everyone Says I Love You)</p>
                        <p> While manipulating a suspicious spouse might require 
                          only a bribed shrink, manipulating an entire intelligence 
                          service would require a feedback source capable of getting 
                          access to secret information that is both compartmentalized 
                          and restricted on a &quot;need to know&quot; basis. 
                          Angleton held that a penetration able to accomplish 
                          this feat would most probably located in the counterintelligence 
                          branch, which through its investigative function can 
                          access to multiple compartments. Even so, the access 
                          of a single mole would be limited by what cases he had 
                          been assigned. What would greatly expand the feedback 
                          would be two moles, each located in a different counterintelligence 
                          branch, for example, CIA counterintelligence and FBI 
                          counterintelligence. Such a combination, if efficiently 
                          managed, could cosmically expand their access, since 
                          each could produce leads for the other to investigate--- 
                          leads which would generate a legitimate need to know 
                          for each mole. For example, if such a combo existed, 
                          Mole A in CIA could inform the FBI through the CIA-FBI 
                          liaison that there was suspicion about X. The FBI, charged 
                          with investigating all espionage in the US, which turn 
                          the case over to its counterintelligence branch, which 
                          would give Mole B the access and need to know to delve 
                          into the concerning X. Angleton feared that such a dual 
                          penetration would allow the KGB to effectively control 
                          the assessment of American intelligence Others, including 
                          J. Edgar Hoover in the FBI and William Colby in the 
                          CIA, did not share Angleton's concern. Hoover threatened 
                          to sever its cooperation with Angleton~s staff and Colby 
                          characterized the likelihood of the Russian intelligence 
                          service recruiting moles simultaneously in both the 
                          CIA and FBI counterintelligence as preposterous and 
                          Angleton as paranoid. Angleton was fired. </p>
                        <p>Yet, the dual recruitment Angleton feared is precisely 
                          happened in the nineteen-eighties when both Aldrich 
                          Ames, heading the CIA's anti-Soviet counterintelligence, 
                          and Robert Phillip Hanssen, working in the FBI Soviet 
                          counterintelligence, both operated as moles for the 
                          Russian Intelligence Service. </p>
