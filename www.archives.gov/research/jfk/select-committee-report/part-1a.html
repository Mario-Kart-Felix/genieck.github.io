The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy (Warren Commission) concluded that President Kennedy was 

struck by two bullets that were fired from above and behind him.<em>(1)</em>

According to the Commission, one bullet hit the President near the

base of the back of the neck, slightly to the right of the spine, and

exited from the front of the neck. The other entered the right rear of

the President's head and exited from the right side of the head, causing a large wound. <em>(2)</em>



<br><br>The Commission based its findings primarily upon the testimony

of the doctors who had treated the President at Parkland Memorial

Hospital in Dallas and the doctors who performed the autopsy on the

President at the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. <em>(3)</em>



<br><br>In forming this conclusion, neither the members of the Warren Commission, 

nor its staff, nor the doctors who had performed the autopsy,

took advantage of the X-rays and photographs of the President that

were taken during the course of the autopsy. <em>(4)</em> The reason for the

failure of the Warren Commission to examine these primary materials

is that there was a commitment to make public all evidence examined

by the Commission. <em>(5)</em> The Commission was concerned that publication 

of the autopsy X-rays and photographs would be an invasion of

the privacy of the Kennedy family. <em>(6)</em> The Commission's decision to

rely solely on the testimony of the doctors precluded the possibility

that the Commission might make use of a review of the autopsy evidence 

by independent medical experts to determine if they concurred

with the findings of the doctors at Parkland and Bethesda.



<br><br>A determination of the number and location of the President's

wounds was critical to resolving the question of whether there was

more than one assassin. The secrecy that surrounded the autopsy

proceedings, therefore, has led to considerable skepticism toward the

Commission's findings. Concern has been expressed that authorities

were less than candid, since the Navy doctor in charge of the autopsy

conducted at Bethesda Naval Hospital destroyed his notes, and the

Warren Commission decided to forego an opportunity to view the

X-rays and photographs or to permit anyone else to inspect them.



<br><br>The skepticism has been reinforced by a film taken of the

Presidential motorcade at the moment of the assassination by an amateur movie

photographer, Abraham Zapruder. In the Zapruder film, the President's head is apparently thrown backward as the front right side of

the skull appears to explode, suggesting to critics of the Warren Commission's findings that the President was struck by a bullet that

entered the front of the head. <em>(7)</em> Such a bullet, it has been argued,

was fired 



<br><br><strong>Page 42</strong>



<br><br>by a gunman positioned on the grassy knoll, a park-like area to the 

right and to the front of where the moving limousine was located at

the instant of the fatal shot. <em>(8)</em>



<br><br>Since the Warren Commission completed its investigation, two 

other Government panels have subjected the X-rays and photographs

taken during the autopsy on President Kennedy to examination by

independent medical experts.  A team of forensic pathologists appointed 

by Attorney general Ramsey Clark in 1968,<em>(9)</em> and a panel

retained by the Commission on CIA Activities Within the United

States (Rockefeller Commission) in 1975,<em>(10)</em> reached the same basic

conclusion:  the President was struck by two bullets from behind.  But

neither panel published the X-rays and photographs, nor did either

explain the basis of its conclusions in a public hearing.

Consequently, neither panel was able to relieve significantly doubts that have 

persisted over the years about the nature and location of the President's

wounds.



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="reliance">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(a) Reliance on scientific analysis</em>



<br><br>The committee believed from the beginning of its investigation

that the most reliable evidence upon which it could base determinations as 

to what happened in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963, was an analysis of 

hard scientific data.  Accordingly, the committee contracted

with leading independent experts in the fields of forensic pathology,

ballistics, photography, acoustics, neutron activation analysis and

other disciplines.  The reports submitted by these experts were fully

considered by the committee in formulating its findings.



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="medical">Top of Page</a>

<p><em>(1) The medical evidence</em>.--The committee's forensic pathology

panel was composed of nine members, eight of whom were chief medical 

examiners in major local jurisdictions in the United States.<em>(11)</em>

As a group, they had been responsible for more than 100,000 autopsies, <em>(12)</em> 

an accumulation of experience the committee deemed invaluable in the evaluation 

of the medical evidence--including the autopsy X-rays and photographs--to determine the cause of death of 

the President and the nature and location of his wounds.  The panel 

was also asked to recommend guidelines in the event of a future assassination 

of a President or other high Federal official.<em>(13)</em>

</p>

<p>The committee also employed experts to authenticate the autopsy

materials.  Neither the Clark Panel nor the Rockefeller Commission

undertook to determine if the X-rays and photographs were, in fact,

authentic.  The committee, in light of the numerous issues that had

arisen over the years with respect to autopsy X-rays and photographs,

believed authentication to be a crucial step in the investigation.<em>(14)</em>
</p>


<p>The authentication of the autopsy X-rays and photographs was

accomplished by the committee with the assistance of its photographic

evidence panel as well as forensic dentists, forensic anthropologists

and radiologists working for the committee. <em>(15)</em> Two questions were

put to these experts:

</p>

    <blockquote>Could the photographs and X-rays stored in the National

	Archives be positively identified as being of President Kennedy?<br>

   Was there any evidence that any of these photographs or X-rays 

	had been altered in any manner?</blockquote>



To determine if the photographs of the autopsy subject were in

fact of the President, forensic anthropologists compared the autopsy



<br><br><strong>Page 43</strong>



<br><br>photographs with ante-mortem pictures of the President. This comparison 

was done on the basis of both metric and morphological features. The metric 

analysis relied upon a series of facial measurements

taken from the photographs, while the morphological analysis was

focused on consistency of physical features, particularly those that

could be considered distinctive (shape of the nose, patterns of facial

lines, et cetera). Once unique characteristics were identified,

posterior and anterior autopsy photographs were compared to verify that they,

in fact, depicted the same person.



<br><br>The anthropologists studied the autopsy X-rays in conjunction with

premortem X-rays of the President. A sufficient number of unique

anatomic characteristics were present in X-rays taken before and after

the President's death to conclude that the autopsy X-rays were of

President Kennedy. This conclusion was consistent with the findings

of a forensic dentist employed by the committee. <em>(16)</em> Since many of

the X-rays taken during the course of the autopsy included the President's 

teeth, it was possible to determine, using the President's dental

records, that the X-rays were of the President.



<p>Once the forensic dentist and anthropologists had determined that

the autopsy photographs and X-rays were of the President, photographic 

scientists and radiologists examined the original autopsy

photographs, negatives, transparencies, and X-rays for signs of

alteration. They concluded there was no evidence of the photographic or

radiographic materials having been altered.<em>(17)</em> Consequently, the

committee determined that the autopsy X-rays and photographs were

a valid basis for the conclusions of the committee's forensic

pathology panel.</p>



<p>While the examination of the autopsy X-rays and photographs was

the principal basis of its analysis, the forensic pathology panel also

had access to all relevant witness testimony. In addition, all tests

and evidence analyses requested by the panel were performed. <em>(18)</em> It was

only after considering all of this evidence that the panel reached its

conclusions.</p>



<p>The forensic pathology panel concluded that President Kennedy

was struck by two, and only two, bullets, each of which entered from

the rear. <sup>1</sup> The panel further concluded that the President was struck

by one bullet that entered in the upper right of the back and exited

from the front of the throat, and one bullet that entered in the right

rear of the head near the cowlick area and exited from the right side

of the head, toward the front. This second bullet caused a massive

wound to the President's head upon exit. There is no medical evidence

that the President was struck by a bullet entering the front of the

head,<em>(19)</em> and the possibility that a bullet could have struck the

President and yet left no evidence is extremely remote. Because this conclusion 

appears to be inconsistent with the backward motion of the

President's head in the Zapruder film, the committee consulted a

wound ballistics expert to determine what relationship, if any, exists

between the direction from which a bullet strikes the head and subse-
</p>


<p><font size="-1"><em><sup>1</sup>In many of its conclusions, the forensic pathology panel voted

8 to 1, with the dissenting vote being consistently that of Cyril H. Wecht, M.D., coroner of 

Allegheny County, Pa.  In all references to conclusions of the panel, unless it is specifically 

stated that it was unanimous, it should be assumed that Dr. Wecht dissented.</em></font>



</p>
<p><strong>Page 44</strong></p>



<p>quent head movement. <em>(20)</em> The expert concluded that nerve damage

from a bullet entering the President's head could have caused his back

muscles to tighten which, in turn, could have caused his head to move

toward the rear.<em>(21)</em> He demonstrated the phenomenon in a filmed

experiment which involved the shooting of goats. <em>(22)</em> Thus, the committee 

determined that the rearward movement of the President's

head would not be fundamentally inconsistent with a bullet striking

from the rear.<em>(23)</em>    </p>                 



<br><br>The forensic pathology panel determined that Governor Connally

was struck by a bullet from the rear, one that entered just below the

right armpit and exited below the right nipple of the chest. It then

shattered the radius bone of the Governor's right wrist and caused a

superficial wound to the left thigh. <em>(24)</em> Based on its examination of

the nature and alinement of the Governor's wounds, the panel concluded that 

they were all caused by a single bullet that came from the

rear. It concluded further that, having caused the Governor's wounds,

the bullet was dislodged from his left thigh.



<br><br>The panel determined that the nature of the wounds of President

Kennedy and Governor Connally was consistent with the possibility

that one bullet entered the upper right back of President Kennedy and,

after emerging from the front of the neck, caused all of the

Governor's wounds. <em>(25)</em> A factor that influenced the panel significantly was the

ovoid shape of the wound in the Governor's back, indicating that the

bullet had begun to tumble or yaw before entering.<em>(26)</em> An ovoid

wound is characteristic of one caused by a bullet that has passed

through or glanced off an intervening object. <em>(27)</em> Based on the evidence 

available to it, the panel concluded that a single bullet passing

through both President Kennedy and Governor Connally would support a fundamental 

conclusion that the President was struck by two, and only two, bullets, each 

fired from behind. <em>(28)</em> Thus, the forensic pathology panel's 

conclusions were consistent with the so-called single 

bullet theory advanced by the Warren Commission. <em>(29)</em>



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="reaction">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(2) Reaction times and alinement</em>.--The hypothesis that both the

President and the Governor were struck by a single bullet had originally 

been based on the Warren Commission's examination of the

Zapruder film and test firings of the assassination rifle. The time

between the observable reactions of the President and of the Governor 

was too short to have allowed, according to the Commission's

test firings, two shots to have been fired from the same rifle.<em>(30)</em>

FBI marksmen who test fired the rifle for the Commission employed

the telescopic sight on the rifle, and the minimum firing time between

shots was approximately 2.25 to 2.3 seconds.<em>(31)</em> The time between

the observable reactions of the President and the Governor, according

to the Commission, was less than two seconds. <sup>2</sup><br><br>The Commission determined that its hypothesis that the same

bullet struck both the President and the Governor was supported by

visual observations of the relative alinement of the two men in the

limousine, by a trajectory analysis and by wound ballistics tests. The Commis-



<br><br><font size="-1"><em><sup>2</sup>In its report, the committee's photographic 

evidence panel suggested that Governor Connally reacted to his wounds approximately one second

after President Kennedy.  This interval might have been even less, but a sign obstructing 

Zapruder's field of view made it impossible to study the Governor immediately after the President 

first appeared to be reacting to having been shot.</em></font>



<br><br><strong>Page 45</strong>



<br><br>sion said, however, that a determination of which shot hit the Governor 

was "not necessary to any essential findings."<em>(32)</em>



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="neutron">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(3) Neutron activation analysis</em>.--In addition to the conclusions

reached by the committee's forensic pathology panel, the single bullet

theory was substantiated by the findings of a neutron activation analysis 

performed for the committee.<em>(33)</em> The bullet alleged to have

caused the injuries to the Governor and the President was found on a

stretcher at Parkland Hospital.<em>(34)</em> Numerous critics have alleged

that this bullet, labeled "pristine" because it appeared to have been

only slightly damaged, could not have caused the injuries to both the

Governor (particularly his shattered wrist) and the President. Some

have even suggested the possibility that the bullet wounded neither Connally 

nor Kennedy, that it was planted on the stretcher. <em>(35)</em> Neutron

activation analysis, however, established that it was highly likely

that the injuries to the Governor's wrist were caused by the bullet

found on the stretcher in Parkland Hospital. <em>(36)</em> Further, the committee's 

wound ballistics expert concluded that the bullet found on

the stretcher--Warren Commission exhibit 399 (CE 399)--is of a

type that could have caused the wounds to President Kennedy and

Governor Connally without showing any more deformity than it

does.<em>(37)</em>



<br><br>In determining whether the deformity of CE 399 was consistent

with its having passed through both the President and Governor, the

committee considered the fact that it is a relatively long, stable,

fully jacketed bullet, typical of ammunition often used by the military.

Such ammunition tends to pass through body tissue more easily than

soft nose hunting bullets. <em>(38)</em> Committee consultants with knowledge

in forensic pathology and wound ballistics concluded that it would not

have been unusual for such a fully jacketed bullet to have passed

through the President and the Governor and to have been only minimally deformed. <em>(39)</em>



<br><br>The neutron activation analysis further supported the single

bullet theory by indicating that there was evidence of only two bullets among

the fragments recovered from the limousine and its occupants.<em>(40)</em>

The consultant who conducted the analysis concluded that it was

"highly likely" that CE 399 and the fragments removed from Governor

Connally's wrist were from one bullet; that one of the two fragments

recovered from the floor of the limousine and the fragment removed

from the President's brain during the autopsy were from a second

bullet. <em>(41)</em><sup>3</sup> Neutron activation analysis showed no evidence of a

third bullet among those fragments large enough to be tested.



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="photo">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(4) Photographic evidence</em>.--The committee also considered photographic 

evidence in its analysis of the shots. The Zapruder film, the

only continuous chronological visual record of the assassination, is

the best available photographic evidence of the number and timing of the

shots that struck the occupants of the Presidential limousine.



<br><br>The committee's panel of photographic experts examined specially

enhanced and stabilized versions of the Zapruder film for two purposes: (1) to try to draw conclusions about the timing of the shots

from visual reactions of the victims; and (2) to determine whether



<br><br><font size="-1"><em><sup>3</sup>The other large fragment recovered from the floor of the 

limousine had no lead in it, and therefore was not subjected to neutron activation analysis.</em></font>



<br><br><strong>Page 46</strong>



<br><br>the alignment of the President and the Governor was consistent with

the single bullet theory. The panel also examined still photographs.



<br><br>Several conclusions with respect to the validity of the

single-bullet theory were reached.<em>(42)</em> The panel concluded there is clear photographic 

evidence that two shots, spaced approximately 6 seconds

apart, struck the occupants of the limousine. By Zapruder frame 207

when President Kennedy is seen going behind a sign that obstructed

Zapruder's view, he appears to be reacting to a severe external stimulus. 

This reaction is first indicated in the vicinity of frame 200 of

the Zapruder film. The President's right hand freezes in the midst of a

waving motion, followed by a rapid leftward movement of his

head. <em>(43)</em> There is, therefore, photographic evidence of a shot striking 

the President by this time.



<br><br>Governor Connally shows no indication of distress before he disappears 

behind the sign at Zapruder frame 207, but as he emerges

from behind the sign after frame 222, he seems to be reacting to some

severe external stimulus. <em>(44)</em> By frame 226, when all of the limousine

occupants have reappeared in Zapruder's field of view, the panel

found indictions in observable physical attitude and changes of facial

expression to indicate that both the President and the Governor were

reacting to their wounds. The President's reactions are obvious--he

leans forward and clutches his throat. The Governor displays a pronounced 

rigid posture and change in facial expression. <sup>4</sup><em>(45)</em>



<br><br>To study the relative alinement of the President and Governor

Connelly within the limousine, the photographic panel paid particular

attention to the Zapruder frames just, before the President and the

Governor were obstructed, by the sign, employing a stereoscopic

(depth) analysis of frames 187 and 193 and still photographs taken at

about the same time from the south side of Elm Street. The panel

found that the alinement of the President and the Governor during

this period was consistent with the single bullet hypothesis.<em>(46)</em>



<br><br>The photographic evidence panel determined, further, that the

explosive effect of the second shot to strike, President Kennedy, the

fatal head shot is depicted in Zapruder frame 313. By frame 313,

the President's head is seen exploding, leading the panel to conclude

that the actual moment of impact was approximately frame 312. <em>(47)</em>



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="acoustical">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(5) Acoustical evidence and blur analysis</em>.--The committee performed 

two other scientific tests that addressed the question of the

direction and timing of the bullets that struck the President. First, it

contracted with acoustical consultants for an analysis of a tape

recording of a radio transmission made at the time of the assassination. 

The experts decided there were four shots on the recording. <em>(48)</em>

The first, second and fourth came from the Texas School Book Depository 

behind the President, the third came from the grassy knoll to

the right front of the President. Taking the shot to the President's

head at frame 312 as the last of the four shots, and thus as a

possible base point,<sup>5</sup> it was possible to correlate the other sounds identified

as probable gunfire with the Zapruder film.<em>(49)</em> Since the acoustical



<br><br><font size="-1"><em><sup>4</sup>There is no scientific method for determining the elapsed time between when 

a shot hits and when a person visibly reacts.  Different people have different reaction times; 

moreover, a person's reaction time often depends on where he has been hit.</em></font>



<br><br><font size="-1"><em><sup>5</sup>The committee considered using frame 328 as a possible base point.  

In this analysis, the head shot occurring at frame 312 would, according to the acoustics results, have 

originated from the grassy knoll.  This alternative, however, was rejected.</em></font>



<br><br><strong>Page 47</strong>



<br><br>consultants concluded that the two earliest shots came from the

depository, the shots (or at least their shock waves) would have reached the

limousine at between frames 157 and 161 and frames 188 and 191.

When coupled with the photographic evidence showing a reaction by

President Kennedy beginning in the vicinity of frame 200, it appeared

that he was first struck by a bullet at approximately frame 190.<sup>6</sup><br><br>Second, the photographic evidence panel also studied the blurs on

the Zapruder film that were caused by Zapruder's panning errors, that

is, the effect of a lack of smooth motion as Zapruder moved from left

to right with his camera. This was done in an effort to determine

whether the blurs resulted from Zapruder's possible reaction to the

sound of gunshots. <em>(50)</em> This analysis indicated that blurs occurring

at frames 189-197 and 312-334 may reasonably be attributed to

Zapruder's startle reactions to gunshots. The time interval of the

shots associated with these blurs was determined to be approximately 6 to 7

seconds. The possibility that other blurs on the film might be attributable to 

Zapruder's reactions to gunshots could not be confirmed or

dismissed without additional data.



<br><br>Taken together with other evidence, the photographic and

acoustical evidence led the committee to conclude that President Kennedy and

Governor Connally were struck by one bullet at approximately

Zapruder frame 190, and that the President was struck by another bullet at frame 312.



<br><br>Thus, from the results of the analyses by its experts in the fields

of forensic pathology, photography, acoustics, wound ballistics and

neutron activation analysis, the committee concluded that President

Kennedy was struck by two shots fired from behind.



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="shots">Top of Page</a><br><br><strong>2. The shots that struck President Kennedy from behind were fired from

The Warren Commission concluded that the shots that killed President Kennedy and 

wounded Governor Connally "...were fired from the sixth floor window at the 

southeast corner of the Texas School Book Depository." <em>(51)</em> It based 

its conclusion on eyewitness testimony, physical evidence found on the sixth floor 

of the depository, medical evidence and the absence of "...credible evidence 

that the shots were fired from ...any other location."<em>(52)</em> <br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="scientific">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(a) Scientific analysis</em>



<br><br>In investigating this aspect of the case, the committee relied

heavily on the scientific analysis of physical evidence, and again the

conclusions of the forensic pathology panel were relevant. The panel

concluded that the two bullets that struck the President came from

behind and that the fatal head shot was moving in a downward direction

when it struck the President. <em>(53)</em> <sup>7</sup> Thus, forensic pathology provided

<br><br><font size="-1"><em><sup>7</sup>The panel used both the location of the wounds and Zapruder frame 312 to determine 

the "downward" slope of the fatal head shot.  It did not attempt to determine the slope of the bullet that struck 

the President's back because the moment of impact was not thought to be visible in the film.  This decision by the forensic 

pathology panel was made well before the photographic panel reached its conclusion regarding the President's 

and Governor Connally's reactions as shown in the Zapruder film.</em></font>



<br><br><strong>Page 48</strong>



<br><br>able evidence as to the origin of the shots:  The gunman who fired the

shot that hit President Kennedy and Governor Connally at approximately 

frame 190 of the Zapruder film fired from behind, and the gunman who fired the shot that hit the President in the head at frame

312 was positioned above and to the rear of the presidential limousine.



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="trajectory">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(1) Trajectory analysis</em>.--Another project pertaining to the origin

of the shots involved the trajectory of the bullets that hit the President.

Although the Warren Commission also studied trajectory, its analysis

consisted of proving that a bullet fired from the southeast corner of

the sixth floor of the book depository could have hit the President

and then hit the Governor and that another bullet fired from that location

could have caused the wound to the President's head. Basically,

purpose of the Commission's trajectory analysis was to prove that it

was possible for the prime suspect, Lee Harvey Oswald, to have hit

both the President and the Governor from the sixth floor of the

depository.



<br><br>The committee approached the problem without making prior assumptions 

as to the origin of the shots. It was an interdisciplinary

effort, drawing from the expertise of forensic pathologists,

acoustical and photographic analysts and an engineer from the staff of the

National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who plotted the

trajectories. <em>(54)</em>



<br><br>The trajectory analysis was based on three types of data. From

the acoustical analysis of the radio transmission, the timing of the

shots was obtained. From the photographic analysis of the Zapruder

film and the acoustical analysis, it was possible to know with relative

precision when each of the shots struck--at approximately Zapruder

frame 190 for the shot that struck the President in the back of the

neck, and at Zapruder frame 312, for the fatal shot to the President's

head. Through an analysis of those frames and still photographs taken

at approximately the same time from the south side of Elm Street, it

was possible to determine the location of the limousine in the plaza,

the sitting positions of President Kennedy and Governor Connally and

their alinement to one another. <em>(55)</em>



<br><br>By then coordinating this data with the forensic pathology panel's

analysis of the exit and entry wounds sustained by President Kennedy, it was possible to plot the path of the bullets out to their

source.  Separate direction and slope trajectories were developed for two bullets---the one that caused the President's back and neck wounds, and

the one that caused his fatal head wound.<em>(56)</em> A third trajectory

analysis was conducted to test the hypothesis that the first bullet

also caused the wounds to Governor Connally, using for this analysis the

exit wounds to the President's neck and the entry wound to the

Governor's back. <em>(57)</em>



<br><br>All three trajectories intercepted the southeast face of the Texas

School Book Depository building.<em>(58)</em> While the trajectories could

not be plotted with sufficient precision to determine the exact point

from which the shots were fired, they each were calculated with a margin of error reflecting the precision of the underlying data. 

The margins of error were indicated as circles within which the shots originated. 

The southeast corner window of the depository was inside each

of the circles. <em>(59)</em>



<br><br><strong>Page 49</strong>



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="photographic">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(2) Photographic evidence</em>.--The photographic evidence panel examined 

evidence possibly relevant to the question of the origin of the

shots, as follows:     



<br><br>The panel examined a motion picture of the southeast corner window 

of the depository taken a short time prior to the shots. <em>(60)</em>

While there is an impression of motion in the film, the panel could not attribute 

it to the movement of a person or an object and instead attributed the motion 

to photographic artifacts.<em>(61)</em> The panel's findings

were the same with respect to apparent motion in adjacent windows

shown in the film.<em>(62)</em>



<br><br>The panel studied two photographs taken within minutes of the

assassination. <em>(63)</em> While no human face or form could be detected in

the sixth floor southeast window, the panel was able to conclude that

a stack of boxes in the window had been rearranged during the interval

of the taking of the two photographs.<em>(64)</em>



<br><br>There is evidence, a motion picture film made by Charles L. Bronson, that 

some independent researchers believe shows a figure or figures

in the sixth floor depository window several minutes before the

shooting.  The film came to the attention of the committee toward the

end of its investigation.  Some members of the committee's photographic 

evidence panel did conduct a preliminary review (without enhancement) of the film.  

While motion was detected in the window, it was considered more likely to be a random photographic artifact than

human movement.  Nevertheless, the limited review was not sufficient

to determine definitively if the film contained evidence of motion

made by human figures.<em>(65)</em> Because of its high quality, it was

recommended that the Bronson film be analyzed further.



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="witness">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(b) Witness testimony</em>



<br><br>While the committee relied primarily on scientific analysis of physical 

evidence as to the origin of the shots, it also considered the testimony of witnesses.  

The procedure used to analyze their statements was as follows:



<br><br>First, all available prior statements were read by the committee and

studied for consistency.  The objective was to identify inconsistencies

either between the words of one witness and another or between the

various words of a witness whose story had changed.  The statements

were obtained from the files of the Dallas Police Department, Dallas

Sheriff's Office, the FBI, Secret Service and Warren Commission.



<br><br>Second, an attempt was made to locate the witnesses and to show

them the statements they made in the course of the original investigation.  

Each witness was asked to read his statements and to indicate 

whether they were complete and accurate.  If statements were inaccurate, 

or if a witness was aware of information that was not include,

he was asked to make corrections or provide additional information.

In addition, where relevant questions had not been asked, the committee

asked them.<em>(66)</em>



<br><br>There are inherent limitations in such a process.  Any information

provided by a witness in 1978--15 years after the assassination--must

be viewed in light of the passage of time that causes memories to fade

and honest accounts to become distorted.  Certainly, it cannot be

considered with the same reliability as information provided in

1963-64.



<br><br><strong>Page 50</strong>



<br><br>To the extent that they are based on witness testimony, the

conclusions of the committee were vitally affected by the quality of the original

investigation. The inconsistencies in the statements--the questions

not asked, the witnesses not interviewed--all created problems that defied

resolution 15 years after the events in Dallas.



<br><br>Nevertheless, the committee considered all of the witness statements

and determined to what extent they corroborated or independently

substantiated, or contradicted, the conclusions indicated by the

scientific evidence.



<br><br>An example of such witness testimony is that relating to the discovery 

of the rifle and shell casings in the Texas School Book Depository. 

(Because detailed versions of witness testimony taken in the

original investigation are a matter of public record, only brief

resumes are included here.)                                           



<br><br>Deputy Sheriff Luke Mooney testified to the Warren Commission

that at approximately 1 p.m. on November 22, 1963, he discovered

three spent rifle shells on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book

Depository. <em>(67)</em> He stated that he was in the southeast corner of the

building when he noticed boxes stacked high in the vicinity of the

window. <em>(68)</em> He then squeezed in between a space in the boxes and

saw three spent rifle shells in the vicinity of the window. <em>(69)</em>

Mooney also told of seeing boxes stacked up as though they were a prop or

rest for a weapon. <em>(70)</em>



<br><br>Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone told the Warren Commission that

he arrived on the sixth floor of the depository subsequent to the discovery 

of the three spent rifle shells. <em>(71)</em> He said he went to the east

end of the floor and began working his way across to the west end,

looking in, under and around boxes and pallets. <em>(72)</em> At the wall near

a row of windows, he noticed a small space between some of the boxes.

When he squeezed through the opening, he saw a rifle between two

rows of boxes. The time was 1:22 p.m. <em>(73)</em>



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="firearms">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(c) Firearms evidence</em>



<br><br>The rifle Boone found, a. 6.5 millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano, was

analyzed by the FBI in 1963-64 and by the committee's firearms

panel in 1978, as was the other firearms evidence that was recovered.

It was determined in both investigations that the bullet found on a

stretcher at Parkland Hospital had been fired from the rifle found in

the depository, as were two fragments recovered from the Presidential

limousine. <em>(74)</em> Further, the three cartridge cases found on the sixth

floor of the depository were determined to have been fired in the

Mannlicher-Carcano.<sup>8</sup><em>(75)</em>



<br><br>Through neutron activation analysis, the committee found that the

 firearms evidence could be even more directly linked to the wounds

 suffered by the President and Governor Connally. It is highly likely

 that the bullet found on the stretcher was the one that passed through 

 Governor Connally's wrist, leaving tiny particles behind, and the

frag-



<br><br><font size="-1"><em><sup>8</sup>The committee firearms panel determined that the evidence 

stored in the National Archives ballistically matched the bullets fired by the FBI in 1964 tests from the 

Mannlicher-Carcano found by Boone.  Since the rifle had been test fired numerous times since 1963, its 

barrel had been altered by wear, and bullets the panel fired from the rifle did not match either the FBI 

test cartridges or those found on the sixth floor of depository or that found on the stretcher.</em></font>



<br><br><strong>Page 51</strong>



<br><br>ments retrieved from the limousine came from the same bullet as the

fragments taken from President Kennedy's brain. <em>(76)</em>



<br><br>Over the years, skepticism has arisen as to whether the rifle found

in the depository by Boone is the same rifle that was delivered to the

Warren Commission and is presently stored in the National Archives.

The suspicion has been based to some extent on allegations that police

officers who first discovered the rifle identified it as a 7.5 millimeter

German Mauser. <em>(77)</em> The controversy was intensified by the allegation 

that various photographs of the rifle, taken at different times,

portray inconsistencies with respect to the proportions of the various

component parts. <em>(78)</em>



<br><br>To resolve the controversy, the committee assembled a wide range

of photographs of the rifle: a police photograph taken where it was

found in the depository; a motion picture film taken by a television

station showing the rifle when it was found by the police; a

series of photographs of a police officer carrying the rifle from the

depository; photographs taken as the rifle was carried through the

halls of Dallas Police Department; and photographs taken later by

the FBI and Dallas Police Department. <em>(79)</em>



<br><br>The examination by committee photographic consultants determined

that all photographs were of the same rifle. Both a study of proportions 

and a comparison of identifying marks indicated that only one

rifle was involved. <em>(80)</em>



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="summary2">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(d) Summary of the evidence</em>



<br><br>In the final analysis, the committee based its finding that the shots

that struck President Kennedy were fired from the Texas School Book

Depository on the quantity and quality of the evidence, to wit:



    <blockquote>The findings of forensic pathologists that the shots that hit the

	President came from behind;<br>

    The results of the trajectory analysis that traced the bullets to the vicinity of sixth floor window of the depository;<br>

    The conclusion of acoustics experts that the shots came from the vicinity of the sixth floor window of the depository;<br>

    The positive identification by firearms experts that the rifle found on the sixth floor of the depository was the one 

    that fired the bullet found on a stretcher at Parkland Hospital and fragments retrieved from the Presidential limousine;<br>

    The results of neutron activation analysis indicating that it was highly likely that the bullet found on the stretcher at Parkland

    Hospital was the one that passed through Governor Connally's wrist, and that the fragments found in the limousine were from

    the bullet that struck the President in the head;<br>

    The conclusion of photographic experts that the rifle found in the depository was the same one that was repeatedly photographed

    in November 1963 and that is presently stored at the National Archives.</blockquote>



The committee also weighed the firsthand testimony of witnesses

but with caution, because of the problem of the passage of time.

Besides the statements of law officers on the scene immediately after

the assassination, it considered the accounts of bystanders in Dealey

Plaza, bearing in mind that these were recollections of fleeting mo-



<br><br><strong>Page 52</strong>



<br><br>ments when emotions were running high. The committee noted, however, 

that a number of the Dealey Plaza witnesses said they saw either

a rifle or a man with a rifle in the vicinity of the sixth floor

southeast corner window of the book depository.

The Warren Commission concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald owned

the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book

Depository.  Since the Commission further concluded that Oswald was the assassin

of the President, his background is relevant.



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="biography">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(a) Biography of Lee Harvey Oswald</em>



<br><br>Oswald was born in New Orleans, La., on October 18, 1939, two

months after the death of his father. His mother remarried, and, from

1945 until 1952, the family lived in a number of cities in Texas and

Louisiana. This marriage ended in divorce when Oswald was nine.



<br><br>In 1952, Oswald and his mother moved to New York City. His

school record was marked by chronic truancy, and a psychiatric examination 

suggested that he was emotionally disturbed. Oswald and

his mother returned to New Orleans in 1954.



<br><br>After finishing the ninth grade, the 16-year-old Oswald dropped

out of school. The following year, he joined the U.S. Marine Corps.

Asserting the ill-health and distressing financial situation of his

mother, Oswald obtained a release from the Marines in 1959. Following 

his discharge, he spent 3 days with his mother in Fort Worth, 

Tex., and then went to New Orleans. From there, he traveled to the

Soviet Union where he tried to become a Soviet citizen.



<br><br>In April 1961, Oswald married a 19-year-old Russian woman,

Marina Nikolaevna Prusakova, whom he had met while working in

Minsk. Having become disillusioned with Soviet life, he returned to

the United States with his wife and baby daughter the following year.

The Oswalds arrived in Fort Worth, Tex. on June 14, 1962, and soon

became acquainted with a number of people in the Dallas-Fort Worth

Russian-speaking community. Oswald moved to Dallas in October

1962 where he found a job with a graphic arts company. Marina followed in November, but their marriage was plagued by intermittent

feuding.



<br><br>In March 1963, according to the Warren Commission, Oswald purchased a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle and telescopic sight from a Chicago 

mail order house. He also ordered a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson pistol from a Los Angeles firm. 

According to Marina Oswald, he probably used the rifle in an attempt in April to kill Edwin A. Walker, a

retired Army general who had been relieved from his post in West Germany for distributing

rightwing literature to his troops. Walker was not harmed. 



<br><br>In April 1963, Oswald went to New Orleans.  Meanwhile, Marina

and the baby moved to the home of a friend, Ruth Paine, in Irving,

Tex., in late April. In May, she joined Oswald in New Orleans. On

July 19, Oswald was dismissed from his job for inefficiency. In May



<br><br><strong>Page 53</strong>



<br><br>and June, Oswald had expressed an interest in the Fair Play for Cuba

Committee.  In August, he distributed pro-Castro leaflets and also

made two radio broadcasts on behalf of the Castro regime.  Marina

Oswald and her baby returned to Texas to stay with Ruth Paine in

Irving on September 22.



<br><br>Oswald went to Mexico City in the latter part of September. He

visited the Russian Embassy and Consulate and the Cuban Consulate 

there, but he failed to get permission to travel to either country. He

returned to Dallas on October 3, 1963. He visited Marina in Irving on

several occasions but continued to try to find a place to live in

Dallas.  On October 14, Oswald moved into a roominghouse on North Beckley

Avenue in Dallas. He began work at the Texas School Book Depository 

2 days later. On October 20, Marina gave birth to their second

daughter. She returned to the Paine home in Irving where Oswald

visited on November 1, and from November 8 until November 11.  

Oswald next visited Marina and his children in Irving on the evening

of November 21. He returned to Dallas the following morning.



<br><br>Shortly after the assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, 

Dallas Patrolman J.D. Tippit was shot and killed. At

approximately 2 p.m., Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested in the Texas

Theatre. He was subsequently charged in the murder of Tippit and

named as a suspect in the Kennedy assassination.



<br><br>On November 24, 1963, while he was being escorted through the

basement of Dallas police headquarters in preparation for being transferred 

to the Dallas County Sheriff's office, Oswald was fatally

wounded by a single shot fired from a pistol by Jack Ruby, a Dallas

nightclub operator.



<br><br>As noted, the Warren Commission had traced the chain of possession

of the alleged assassination rifle and determined that the name on the

money order and purchase form used to buy the rifle was "A. Hidell"

which it determined to be an alias used by Oswald. <em>(81)</em> It also

determined that the rifle was sent to a Dallas post office box rented

on October 9, 1962 by Oswald. <em>(82)</em> Through handwriting analysis, the

Commission determined that Oswald had filled out and signed the

documents relative to the purchase and receipt of the rifle. <em>(83)</em>

Moreover, the Commission received testimony that Oswald owned a rifle

and that it was not in its usual storage place at the residence of

Michael and Ruth Paine in Irving, Tex., when police searched the residence on

the afternoon of November 22, 1963.



<br><br>Photographs of Oswald holding a rifle were also recovered from

among his personal possessions, and the Commission concluded that

the rifle in the photograph was the one found on the sixth floor of

the book depository. <em>(85)</em> A palm print taken from the barrel of the rifle

was identified as a latent palmprint of Oswald.<em>(86)</em> Finally, the

Commission treated as significant evidence a brown paper sack on

which was identified a latent palmprint of Oswald. <em>(87)</em> It contained

fibers that were determined to be identical to certain fibers of a

blanket in which Oswald had allegedly wrapped the rifle. <em>(88)</em>



<br><br>The committee concluded that the rifle found on the sixth floor

of the book depository was the murder weapon. This determination,

coupled with Warren Commission evidence of Oswald's ownership of

the rifle, if accepted, proved conclusively that Oswald was the owner

of the murder weapon.



<br><br><strong>Page 54</strong>



<br><br>Nevertheless, doubt has been cast on the evidence that Oswald

owned the rifle in question. Critics of the Warren Commission have asserted

that the chain of possession is meaningless, because more than one

Mannlicher-Carcano was issued with the serial number C2766.<em>(89)</em>

They have also argued that the photograph of Oswald holding the

rifle is a fake and that his palmprint was planted on the barrel. <em>(90)</em>



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="committee3">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(b) The committee's approach</em>



<br><br>The committee decided that one way to determine whether Oswald

did, in fact, own the murder weapon was to test the reliability of the

evidence used by the Warren Commission to establish ownership and

to subject the available evidence to further scientific analysis.



<br><br>The committee posed these questions:



	    <blockquote>Could the handwriting on the money order used to purchase the

    rifle and the application for the post office box be established with

    confidence as that of Lee Harvey Oswald?<sup>9</sup><br>

    Are the photographs of Oswald holding the rifle authentic, and 

	is that rifle the one that was found in the book depository after

    the assassination?</blockquote>



<a href="part-1a.html#top" name="handwriting">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(1) Handwriting analysis</em>.--With respect to the first issue, the committee's 

questioned documents panel, composed of three experts with

approximately 90 years of combined experience in the field of questioned 

document examination, was provided with approximately 50

documents allegedly containing Oswald's handwriting. <em>(91)</em> The panel

was asked to determine whether all of the documents were written by

the same person. Among the documents provided to the panel was the

money order sent to Klein's Sporting Goods Co. of Chicago to pay for

a Mannlicher-Carcano, serial number C2766, the application for the

post office box to which the rifle was subsequently mailed, and two

fingerprint cards signed by Oswald. <em>(92)</em> One of the cards was signed

at the time of his enlistment in the Marine Corps on October 24, 1956;

the other, dated August 9, 1963, was signed by Oswald at the time he

was arrested in New Orleans for disturbing the peace. (Although

Oswald was fingerprinted when he was arrested in Dallas on November 22, 1963, he refused to sign the card.)<sup>10</sup><br><br>The questioned documents panel determined that the money order

and the post office box application were filled out and signed by the

same person and that the handwriting on them was identical to the

handwriting on the two fingerprint cards signed by Oswald. <em>(94)</em> On

the basis of this analysis. the committee determined that Oswald

bought the weapon in question from Klein's Sporting Goods Co.



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="backyard">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(2) The backyard photographs</em>.--The photographs of Oswald holding 

the rifle, with a pistol strapped to his waist and also holding 

copies of "The Militant" and "The Worker," were taken by his wife in the

backyard of Oswald's home on Neeley Street in Dallas in March or

April 1963, according to the testimony of Oswald's widow, Marina,



<br><br><font size="-1"><em><sup>9</sup>The committee also attempted to have its handwriting experts analyze other documents, 

such as the order for the rifle and the envelope in which it was mailed.  The originals had, 

however, been destroyed, and microfilm copies that existed were not suitable for conclusive tests.</em></font>



<br><br><font size="-1"><em><sup>10</sup>The fingerprints on all three cards were examined by the committee's fingerprint expert 

and determined to be those of the same person. (93)</em></font>



<br><br><strong>Page 55</strong>



<br><br>given to the Warren Commission and the committee.<sup>11</sup><em>(95)</em> There has

been considerable controversy about the photographs.  While in the

custody of the Dallas police from November 22 to November 24, 1963,

Oswald claimed that he did not own a rifle and that the photographs

were composites, with his head superimposed over someone else's

body.<em>(96)</em> The Warren Commission, however, concluded that the

photographs were authentic.<em>(97)</em> Critics of the Commission have questioned 

their authenticity for reasons generally based on alleged shadow

inconsistencies, an indication of a grafting inbetween the mouth and

chin, inconsistent body proportions and a disparate square-shaped

chin.<em>(98)</em>



<br><br>To determine if evidence of fakery was present in these photographs,

the photographic evidence panel first sought to determine if they

could be established as having been taken with Oswald's Imperial Reflex camera.  This was done by studying the photographs (and the

single available original negative) for unique identifying characteristics

that would have been imparted by that camera.  Once this was successfully

done, the objects imaged in the photographs, as well as their shadows,

were analyzed photogrammetrically.  Finally, the materials were

visually scrutinized, using magnification, stereoscopic analysis and 

digital image processing.<em>(99)</em>



<br><br>In its analyses, the photographic evidence panel worked with the

original negative and first-generation prints of the photographs.<em>(100)</em>

Only such materials contain the necessary and reliable photographic

information.  In contrast, some of the critics who claimed the photographs 

were faked relied on poor quality copies for their analyses.<em>(101)</em> 

Copies tend to lose detail and include defects that impair 

accurate representation of the photographic image.



<br><br>After subjecting these original photographic materials and the

camera alleged to have taken the pictures to sophisticated analytical

techniques, the photographic evidence panel concluded that it could 

find no evidence of fakery.<em>(102)</em>



<br><br>Of equal significance, a detailed scientific photographic

analysis was conducted by the panel to determine whether the rifle

held by Oswald in the backyard photographs was, in fact, the rifle stored at the National 

Archives.  The panel found a unique identifying mark present

on the weapon in the Archives that correlated with a mark visible on

the rifle in the Oswald backyard photographs, as well as on the

alleged assassination rifle as it appeared in photographs taken after the

assassination in 1963.<em>(103)</em> Because this mark was considered to be a

unique random pattern (ie., caused by wear and tear through use), it

was considered sufficient to warrant the making of a positive

identification.



<br><br><font size="-1"><em><sup>11</sup>Marina Oswald, because of  her testimony, played a 

central but troubling role in the investigation of the Warren Commission.  A great deal of what 

the Commission sought to show about Oswald rested on her testimony, yet she gave incomplete and 

inconsistent statements at various times to the Secret Service, FBI and the Commission.  Marina's role 

in what happened in Dallas rested primarily on the results of scientific analysis.  The committee 

found no evidence that would indicate that Marina had foreknowledge of the assassination or that she helped her husband in any way 

in his efforts to assassinate the President.  In its investigation of conspiracy, the committee's 

undertaking was not furthered by Marina's testimony, since she professed to know little of Oswald's associates 

in New Orleans or Dallas.</em></font>



<br><br><strong>Page 56</strong>



<br><br>In addition, the relative lengths of component parts of the alleged

assassination rifle at the National Archives were compared to component 

parts of the rifle that appeared in various 1963 photographs, 

including the backyard photographs.<em>(104)</em> They were found to be

entirely consistent, component part for component part, with each

other.<sup>12</sup> Upon completion of its analysis, the photographic evidence

panel concluded that the rifle depicted in the backyard photographs

is the one that was found in the book depository after the assassination

and that was stored at the National Archives. <em>(105)</em>



<br><br>In addition to the photographic analysis, the committee was able

to employ handwriting analysis to aid in the determination of whether

the photograph was authentic. During the course of the committee's

investigation, George de Mohrenschildt, who had been a friend of

Oswald, committed suicide. The committee, pursuant to a subpena,

obtained de Mohrenschildt's personal papers, which included another

copy of the Oswald backyard photograph. This copy, unlike any of

those previously recovered, had an inscription on the back: "To my

dear friend George, from Lee." It was dated April 1963 and signed

"Lee Harvey Oswald." <em>(106)</em>



<br><br>In an unpublished manuscript, de Mohrenschildt referred to this

copy of the photograph and stated that after his return from Haiti,

where he had been at the time of the assassination, he discovered the

photograph among personal possessions that he had previously stored

in a warehouse. <em>(107)</em> The committee examined the photograph to

determine its authenticity and examined the handwriting to determine

if Oswald had actually written the inscription and signed it. If Oswald

did sign the photograph, his claim that he did not own the rifle and

that the photograph was a fake could be discounted.



<br><br>The photographic panel found no evidence of fakery in the backyard photographs, 

including the one found in de Mohrenschildt's effects.<em>(108)</em> The handwriting on the back of the de Mohrenschildt

copy was determined by the questioned documents panel to be identical

to all the other documents signed by Oswald, including the fingerprint

cards. <em>(109)</em>



<br><br>Thus, after submitting the backyard photographs to the photographic 

and handwriting panels, the committee concluded that there

was no evidence of fakery in the photographs and that the rifle in the

photographs was identical to the rifle found on the sixth floor of the

depository on November 22, 1963. Having resolved these issues, the

committee concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald owned the rifle from

which the shots that killed President Kennedy were fired.

The Warren Commission found that Lee Harvey Oswald worked

principally on the first and sixth floors of the Texas School Book

Depository, gathering books listed on orders and delivering them to



<br><br><font size="-1"><em><sup>12</sup>Previous studies analyzing the relative lengths of the component parts of rifles

<br><br><strong>Page 57</strong>



<br><br>the shipping room on the first floor. <em>(110)</em> He had, therefore, ready

access to the sixth floor and to the southeast corner window from which

the shots were fired. The Commission reached this conclusion by interviewing Oswald's supervisors and fellow employees. <em>(111)</em>



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="testimony">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(a) Testimony of school book depository employees</em>



<br><br>In its investigation, the committee also considered the statements

and testimony of employees of the Texas School Book Depository who

worked with and supervised Oswald. Roy Truly, superintendent of

the depository, had stated to the Warren Commission that Oswald

"had occasion to go to the sixth floor quite a number of times every day,

each day, after books."<em>(112)</em> Truly and others testified that Oswald

normally had access to the sixth floor of the depository, and a number

of them said that they saw and heard Oswald in the vicinity of the

sixth floor throughout the morning of November 22, 1963. <em>(113)</em>



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="physical">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(b) Physical evidence of Oswald's presence</em>



<br><br>In determining whether Oswald was actually present on the sixth

floor of the depository, the committee paid primary attention to

scientific analysis of physical evidence. Materials were examined for

fingerprints, including a long, rectangular paper sack that was discovered 

near the southeast corner window and cartons that were found

stacked adjacent to the window. The paper sack, which was suitable

for containing a rifle, showed a latent palmprint and fingerprint of

Oswald; one of the cartons showed both a palmprint and fingerprint

identified as belonging to Oswald, and the other showed just his palmprint. 

The determination that Oswald's prints were on the sack and

cartons was originally made in the investigation that immediately

followed the assassination. It was confirmed by a fingerprint expert

retained by the committee. <em>(114)</em>



<br><br>The committee was aware that Oswald's access to the sixth floor

during the normal course of his duties would have provided the opportunity 

to handle these items at any time before the assassination.

Nevertheless, the committee believed that the way the boxes were

stacked at the window and the proximity of the paper sack to the

window from which the shots were fired must be considered as evidence

indicating that he handled the boxes in the process of preparing the

so-called sniper's nest and that he had used the paper sack to carry

the rifle into the depository.



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="whereabouts">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(c) Oswald's whereabouts</em>



<br><br>As for Oswald's presence on the sixth floor shortly before the assassination, 

the committee considered the testimony of Oswald's fellow

employees at the depository. Although a number of them placed him

on the fifth or sixth floor just before noon, a half hour before the

assassination, one recalled he was on the first floor at that same

time. <em>(115)</em> The committee decided not to try to reconcile the

testimony of these witnesses. Whether Oswald was on the first, fifth

or sixth floor at noon, he could have still been on the sixth floor at

12:30. There was no witness who said he saw Oswald anywhere at the time of the assassination, 

and there was no witness who claimed to have been on the sixth

floor and therefore in a position to have seen Oswald, had he been

there.



<br><br><strong>Page 58</strong>



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="lovelady">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(1) Lovelady or Oswald?</em>---It has been alleged that a photograph

taken of the president's limousine at the time of the first shot shows

Oswald standing in the doorway of the depository.<em>(116)</em> Obviously,

if Oswald was the man in the doorway, he could not have been on the

sixth floor shooting at the President.



<br><br>The Warren Commission determined that the man in the doorway

was not Oswald, it was Billy Lovelady, another depository employee.

<em>(117)</em> Critics have challenged that conclusion, charging that Commission 

members did not personally question Lovelady to determine if he

was in fact the man in the photograph. In addition, they argue that no

photograph of Lovelady was published in any of the volumes issued

by the Warren Commission <em>(118)</em>.       



<br><br>The committee asked its photographic evidence panel to determine

whether the man in the doorway was Oswald, Lovelady or someone

else. Forensic anthropologists working with the panel compared the  

photograph with pictures of Oswald and Lovelady, and a photoanalyst 

studied the pattern of the shirt worn by the man in the doorway and 

compared it to the shirts worn by the two men that day. <em>(119)</em>

Based on an assessment of the facial features, the anthropologists

determined that the man in the doorway bore a much stronger resemblance 

to Lovelady than to Oswald. In addition, the photographic analysis of the 

shirt in the photograph established that it corresponded more closely with 

the shirt worn that day by Lovelady.  Based on these analyses, the committee 

concluded that it was highly improbable that the man in the doorway was Oswald and highly

probable that he was Lovelady.



<br><br>The committee's belief that the man in the doorway was Lovelady

was also supported by an interview with Lovelady in which he affirmed 

to committee investigators that he was the man in the

photograph.<em>(120)</em> 



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="witness4">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(2) Witness testimony</em>.--The committee also considered witness  

testimony as to Oswald's whereabouts immediately following the

assassination. Three witnesses were particularly significant. Depository 

Superintendent Roy Truly and Dallas Police Officer M.L. Baker

both entered the depository right after the shots were fired. They

encountered Oswald on the second floor, and in testimony to the Warren 

Commission, they gave the time as 2 to 3 minutes after the

shots. <em>(121)</em> A witness who personally knew Oswald, Mrs. Robert A.

Reid, also a depository employee, testified to the Warren Commission

that she also saw him on the second floor approximately 2 minutes

after the assassination. <em>(122)</em>



<br><br>The testimony of these three witnesses was mutually corroborating.   

Since all were outside the depository when the shots were fired, their

statements that it took them about 2 minutes to get to the second

floor were reasonable.<em>(123)</em> It appeared equally reasonable that in those

same 2 minutes Oswald could have walked from the sixth floor window

to the rear stairway and down four flights of stairs to the second

floor.



<br><br>The conclusion with respect to this evidence alone was not that Lee

Harvey Oswald was the assassin, but merely that the testimony of

these witnesses appeared credible and was probative on the question

of Oswald's whereabouts at the time of the assassination.

The Warren Commission concluded that shortly after the assassination, 

Oswald boarded a bus, but when the bus got caught in a traffic

jam, he disembarked and took a taxicab to his roominghouse.<em>(124)</em>

The Commission also found that Oswald changed clothes at the roominghouse and 

walked about nine-tenths of a mile away from it before

he encountered Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippit. <em>(125)</em> After being

stopped by Tippit, the Commission concluded, Oswald drew a revolver

and shot Tippit four times, killing him. He then ran from the

scene.<em>(126)</em> He was apprehended at approximately 1:50 p.m. in a

nearby movie house, the Texas Theatre. <em>(127)</em>



<br><br>The committee found that while most of the depository employees

were outside of the building at the time of the assassination and returned 

inside afterwards, Oswald did the reverse; he was inside before

the assassination, and afterward he went outside. That Oswald left

the building within minutes of the assassination was significant.

Every other depository employee either had an alibi for the time of the

assassination or returned to the building immediately thereafter.  Oswald alone neither remained nor had an alibi.



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="tippit">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(a) The Tippit murder</em>



<br><br>The committee investigated the murder of Officer Tippit primarily

for its implications concerning the assassination of the President. The

committee relied primarily on scientific evidence. The committee's

firearms panel determined positively that all four cartridge cases

found at the scene of the Tippit murder were fired from the pistol

that was found in Lee Harvey Oswald's possession when he was apprehended 

in the Texas Theatre 35 minutes after the murder.<sup>13</sup><em>(128)</em>



<br><br>In addition, the committee's investigators interviewed witnesses

present at the scene of the Tippit murder.<em>(129)</em> Based on Oswald's

possession of the murder weapon a short time after the murder and

the eyewitness identifications of Oswald as the gunman, the committee

concluded that Oswald shot and killed Officer Tippit. The committee

further concluded that this crime, committed while fleeing the scene

of the assassination, was consistent with a finding that Oswald assassinated the President.



<br><br>The Warren Commission had investigated the possibility that Oswald 

and Tippit were associated prior to the assassination. but it failed

to find a connection. <em>(130)</em> Similarly, the committee's investigation

uncovered no direct evidence of such a relationship, nor did it

attribute any activity or association to Officer Tippit that could be deemed

suspicious. The committee, however, did find and interview one

witness who had not been interviewed by the Warren Commission

or FBI in 1963-64. His name is Jack Ray Tatum, and he reported witnessing the final moments of the shooting of Officer Tippit. <em>(131)</em> 

Oswald, according to Tatum, after initially shooting Tippit from his

position on the sidewalk, walked around the patrol car to where Tippit



<br><br><font size="-1"><em><sup>13</sup>Since Oswald's revolver had been partially modified to shoot different 

ammunition than the type it was manufactured to shoot, it was not possible for the panel to determine 

whether the bullets that killed Tippit were fired from it.  The panel did determine that the characteristics of the bullets were consistent 

with their having been fired from Oswald's revolver.</em></font>



<br><br><strong>Page 60</strong>



<br><br>lay in the street and stood over him while he shot him at point blank range 

in the head.  This action, which is often encountered in gangland

murders and is commonly described as a coup do grace, is more indicative of an 

execution than an act of defense intended to allow escape

or prevent apporhension.  Absent further evidence--which the committee did not develop--

the meaning of this evidence must remain uncertain. <sup>14</sup><br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="capacity">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(b) Oswald: A capacity for violence?</em>



<br><br>The committee also considered the question of whether Oswald's

words or actions indicated that he possessed a "capacity for violence."

The presence of such a trait would not, in and of itself, prove much.

Nevertheless, the absence of any words or actions by Oswald that indicated 

a capactity for violence would be inconsistent with the conclusion that 

Oswald assassinated the President and would be of some significance. 



<br><br>In this regard, the committee noted that Oswald had on more than

one occasion exhibited such behavior.  The most blatant example is the

shooting of Officer Tippit.  The man who shot Tippit shot him four

times at close range and in areas that were certain to cause death.

There can be no doubt that the man who murdered Officer Tippit intended 

to kill him, and as discussed above, the committee concluded

that Oswald was that man.



<br><br>Another example of such behavior occurred in the Texas Theatre at

the time of Oswald's arrest.  All of the police officers present--and

Oswald himself--stated that Oswald physically attempted to resist

arrest.<em>(132)</em> The incident is particulary significant, if, as some of

the officers testified, Oswald attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to fire his

revolver during the course of the struggle.



<br><br>Another incident considered by the committee in evaluating Oswald's 

capacity for violence was the attempted murder of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker 

on April 10, 1963.  The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald shot at Walker 

and that this demonstrated "his propensity to act dramatically and, in this 

instance violently, in furtherance of his beliefs."<em>(133)</em> Many critics of the commission, 

however, dispute the conclusion that Oswald was the shooter in the Walker case.<em>(134)</em>



<br><br>The committee turned to scientific analysis to cast light on the issue.

As discussed earlier, the evidence is conclusive that Oswald owned a

Mannlicher-Carano rifle.  The committee's firearms panel examined

the bullet fragment that was removed from the wall in the home of

General Walker and found that it had characteristics similar to bullets fired 

from Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.<em>(135)</em> In addition,

neutron activation analysis of this fragment confirmed that it was 

probably a Mannlicher-Carcano bullet.<em>(136)</em>



<br><br>In addition, the committee considered the testimony of Marina

Oswald, who stated, among other things, that Lee Harvey Oswald told

her that he had shot at Walder.<em>(137)</em> Further, the committee's handwriting 

experts determined that a handwritten note that, according to

Marina Oswald's testimony, was written to her by Oswald prior to the



<br><br><font size="-1"><em><sup>14</sup>The committee did verify from the Tippit autopsy report that there 

was one wound in the body that slanted upward from front to back.  Though previously unexplained, it 

would be consistent with the observation of Jack Ray Tatum.</em></font>



<br><br><strong>Page 61</strong>



<br><br>Walker shooting, was written by Oswald,<em>(138)</em> This undated note,

although it did not mention General Walker, clearly indicated that

Oswald was about to attempt an act during the course of which he

might be killed or taken into custody.<em>(139)</em> <sup>15</sup><br><br>The committee concluded that the evidence strongly suggested that

Oswald attempted to murder General Walker and that he possessed a

capacity for violence.  Such evidence is supportive of the committee's

conclusion that Oswald assassinated President Kennedy.



<br><br><a href="part-1a.html#top" name="motive">Top of Page</a><br><br><em>(c) The motive</em>



<br><br>Finding a possible motive for Oswald's having assassinated President 

Kennedy was one of the most difficult issues that the Warren

Commission addressed.  The Commission stated that "many factors

were undoubtedly involved in Oswald's motivation for the assassination, 

and the Commission does not believe that it can ascribe to him

any one motive or group of motives."<em>(140)</em> The Commission noted

Oswald's overriding hostility to his environment, his seeking a role in 

history as a great man, his commitment to Marxism, and his capacity

to act decisively without regard to the consequences when such action

would further his aims of the moment.<em>(141)</em>



<br><br>The committee agreed that each of the factors listed by the Warren

Commission accurately characterized various aspects of Oswald's

political beliefs, that those beliefs were a dominant factor in his

life and that in the absence of other more compelling evidence, it

concluded that they offered a reasonable explanation of his motive to

kill  the President.



<br><br>It is the committee's judgment that in the last 5 years of his life,

Oswald was preoccupied with political ideology.  The first clear manifestation 

of this preoccupation was his defection to the Soviet Union 

in the fall of 1959 at the age of 20.<em>(142)</em> This action, in and of

itself, was an indication of the depth of his political commitment.  The words

that accompanied the act went even further.  Oswald stated to officials

at the American Embassy in Moscow that he wanted to renounce his

citizenship and that he intended to give the Russians any information

concerning the Marine Corps and radar operations that he possessed.<em>(143)</em> 

In letters written to his brother Robert, Oswald made it

clear that in the event of war he would not hesitate ot fight on the

side of the Russians against his family or former country.<em>(144)</em> The

paramount importance of his political commitment was indicated in

one letter in which he informed his family that he did not desire to

have any further communications with them as he was starting a new

life in Russia.  It was also reflected in his attempt to commit suicide

when he was informed he would not be allowed to remain in the Soviet

Union. <em>(145)</em> In considering which were the dominant forces in

Oswald's life, the committee, therefore, relied on Oswald's willingness



<br><br><font size="-1"><em><sup>15</sup>With respect to the Walker shooting, reports of the Dallas 

Police Department, made at the time of the shooting and referred to in the Warren Report, reflected that there 

was one witness who stated he saw more than one person leaving the scene after the shooting.  Another 

witness, according to police reports, stated he saw two men, two nights before the shooting, driving 

in the vicinity of the Walker house in a suspicious manner.  These statements were never substantiated, 

and the case remains unsolved.  Nevertheless, if they are true, a possible implication is that 

Oswald had associates who would engage in a conspiracy to commit murder.  The committee conducted a limited investigation to 

see if leads could be developed that might assist in identifying these possible associates.  No 

leads were developed, and this line of inquiry was abandoned.</em></font>



<br><br><strong>Page 62</strong>



<br><br>to renounce his citizenship, to betray military secrets, to take arms

against his own family, and to give up his own life, if necessary, for

his political beliefs.                                          



<br><br>Upon Oswald's return to the United States from the Soviet Union in

1962, although his fervor for that country might have diminished, his

words and actions still revolved around ideological causes. Oswald

made no attempt to hide or tone down his deep-seated feelings. He expounded 

them to those with whom he associated, even when they could

be expected to be opposed. He subscribed to Marxist and Communist

publications such as "The Worker" and "The Militant," and he openly

corresponded with the American Communist Party and the Socialist

Worker's Party. <em>(146)</em> His devotion to his political beliefs was

cogently symbolized by the photograph, authenticated by the committee's

photographic and handwriting panels, in which he is defiantly holding 

copies of "The Worker" and "The Militant" and his rifle, with a

handgun strapped to his waist. <em>(147)</em>



<br><br>His involvement in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee was another

example of Oswald's affinity for political action. <em>(148)</em> This

organization was highly critical of U.S. policy toward the Cuban government

of Fidel Castro. Oswald not only professed to be a member of the organization, 

but he characteristically chose to become a highly visible spokesman. He corresponded 

with the national office, distributed handbills on the streets of New Orleans and twice appeared on a local

radio program representing himself as a spokesman for the organization.



<br><br>The committee fully recognized that during the course of Oswald's

activities in New Orleans he apparently became involved with certain anti-Castro elements, 

although such activities on Oswald's part have never been fully explained.<em>(149)</em> 

Considering the depth of his political commitment, it would not have been uncharacteristic 

for Oswald to have attempted to infiltrate anti-Castro Cuban organizations. <em>(150)</em> 

But the significant point is that regardless of his purpose 

for joining, it is another example of the dominance of political

activity in Oswald's life.                            



<br><br>A short time before the assassination of the President, Oswald

traveled to Mexico City, where he went to the Cuban Consulate and

indicated an intense desire to travel to Cuba and Russia. <em>(151)</em> Once

again, it appears that Oswald was ready to leave his family and his

country to fulfill a political goal. Precisely why Oswald wanted to go

to Cuba or Russia is not known, but it was certainly of significance

that he chose those particular countries, both of which are Marxist.



<br><br>Finally, in considering the extent to which Oswald acted on behalf

of his political beliefs, the Walker shooting also was relevant. As

discussed above, the committee concluded that Oswald attempted to

murder Major General Walker in April 1963. In the city of Dallas, no

one figure so epitomized anticommunism as General Walker. Considering the 

various activities to which Oswald devoted his time, his efforts

and his very existence, General Walker could be readily seen as "an

ultimate enemy." It is known that Oswald was willing to risk death for

his beliefs, so it is certainly not unreasonable to find that he might attempt to kill

Walker, a man who was intensely opposed to his ideology.



<br><br>In analyzing Oswald's possible political motive, the committee considered 

the fact that as one's position in the political spectrum moves



<br><br><strong>Page 63</strong>



<br><br>far enough to the left or right, what may otherwise be recognized as

strikingly dissimilar viewpoints on the spectrum may be viewed as

ideologically related. President Kennedy and General Walker hardly

shared a common political ideology. As seen in terms of American political 

thinking, Walker was a staunch conservative while the President was a liberal. 

It can be argued, however, that from a Marxist's

perspective, they could be regarded as occupying similar positions.

Where Walker was stridently anti-Communist, Kennedy was the

leader of the free world in its fight against communist. Walker was a

militarist. Kennedy had ordered the invasion of Cuba and had moved

to within a hairsbreadth of nuclear war during the Cuban missile

crisis.  Consequently, it may be argued that Oswald could have seen Walker

and Kennedy in the same ideological light.                    



<br><br>The depth and direction of Oswald's ideological commitment is,

therefore, clear. Politics was the dominant force in his the right

down to the last days when, upon being arrested for the assassination, he

requested to be represented by a lawyer prominent for representing Communists. 

Although no one specific ideological goal that Oswald might 

have hoped to achieve by the assassination of President Kennedy can

be shown with confidence, it appeared to the committee that his dominant 

motivation, consistent with his known activities and beliefs, must

have been a desire to take political action. It seems reasonable to conclude 

that the best single explanation for the assassination was his conception 

of political action, rooted in his twisted ideological view of

himself and the world around him.
