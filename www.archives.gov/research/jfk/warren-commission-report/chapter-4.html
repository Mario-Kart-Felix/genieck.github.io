<p> <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>THE PRECEDING chapter has established that the bullets which killed 
    President Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally were fired from the southeast corner window of the 
    sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building and that the weapon which fired these bullets 
    was a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle bearing the serial number C2766. In this chapter 
    the Commission evaluates the evidence upon which it has based its conclusion concerning the identity 
    of the assassin. This evidence includes (1) the ownership and possession of the weapon used to commit 
    the assassination, (2) the means by which the weapon was brought into the Depository Building, (3) 
    the identity of the person present at the window from which the shots were fired, (4) the killing 
    of Dallas Patrolman J. D. Tippit within 45 minutes after the assassination, (5) the resistance to 
    arrest and the attempted shooting of another police officer by the man (Lee Harvey Oswald) subsequently 
    accused of assassinating President Kennedy and killing Patrolman Tippit, (6) the lies told to the 
    police by Oswald, (7) the evidence linking Oswald to the attempted killing of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker 
    (Resigned, U.S. Army) on April 10, 1963, and (8) Oswald's capability with a rifle.</p>

ASSASSINATION WEAPON</strong>
<br><br><a name="purchase"></a><strong>Purchase of Rifle by Oswald</strong>
<br><br>Shortly after the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle was found on the
sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building,1 agents of
the FBI learned from retail outlets in Dallas that Crescent Firearms,
Inc., of New York City, was a distributor of surplus Italian
6.5-millimeter military rifles.2  During the evening of November 22,
1963, a review of the records of Crescent Firearms revealed that the
firm had shipped an Italian carbine, serial number C2766, to Klein's
Sporting Goods Co., of Chicago, Ill.3 After searching their records
from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. the officers of Klein's discovered that a rifle
bearing serial number C2766 had been shipped to one A. Hidell,  
<br><br><strong>Page 119</strong>
<br><br>Post Office Box 2915, Dallas, Tex., on March 20, 1963.4	(See
Waldman Exhibit No. 7, p. 120.)
<br><br>According to its microfilm records, Klein's received an order for
a rifle on March 13, 1963, on a coupon clipped from the February 1963
issue of the American Rifleman magazine.  The order coupon was signed,
in handprinting, "A. Hidell, P.O. Box 2915, Dallas, Texas." (See
Commission Exhibit No. 773, p. 120.)  It was sent in an envelope
bearing the same name and return address in handwriting. Document
examiners for the Treasury Department and the FBI testified
unequivocally that the bold printing on the face of the mail-order
coupon was in the handprinting of Lee Harvey Oswald and that the
writing on the envelope was also his. 5  Oswald's writing on these and
other documents was identified by comparing the writing and printing
on the documents in question with that appearing on documents known to
have been written by Oswald, such as his letters, passport
application, and endorsements of checks.6  (See app. X, p. 568-569.)
<br><br>In addition to the order coupon the envelope contained a. U.S.
postal money order for $21.45, purchased as No. 2,202,130,462 in
Dallas, Tex., on March 12, 1963.7  The canceled money order was
obtained from the Post Office Department.  Opposite the printed words
"Pay To" were written the words "Kleins Sporting Goods," and opposite
the printed word "From" were written the words "A. Hidell, P.O. Box
2915 Dallas, Texas." These words were also in the handwriting of Lee
Harvey Oswald. 8  (See Commission Exhibit No. 788, p. 120.)
<br><br>From Klein's records it was possible to trace the processing of
the order after its receipt.  A bank deposit made on March 13, 1963,
included an item of $21.45.  Klein's shipping order form shows an
imprint made by the cash register which recorded the receipt of $21.45
on March 13, 1963.  This price included $19.95 for the rifle and the
scope, and $1.50 for postage and handling. The rifle without the scope
cost only $12.78.9
<br><br>According to the vice president of Klein's, William
Waldman, the scope was mounted on the rifle by a gunsmith employed by
Klein's, and the rifle was shipped fully assembled in accordance with
customary company procedures. 10  The specific rifle shipped against
the order had been received by Klein's from Crescent on February 21,
1963. It bore the manufacturer's serial number C2766.  On that date,
Klein's placed an internal control number VC836 on this rifle. 11
According to Klein's shipping order form, one Italian carbine 6.5 X-4
x scope, control number VC836, serial number C2766, was shipped parcel
post to "A. Hidell, P.O. Box 2915, Dallas, Texas," on March 20, 1963.
12 Information received from the Italian Armed Forces Intelligence
Service has established that this particular rifle was the only rifle
of  its type bearing serial number C2766.13  (See app. X, p. 554.)
<br><br>The post office box to which the rifle was shipped was rented
to "Lee H. Oswald" from October 9, 1962, to May 14, 1963.14  Experts
on handwriting identification from the Treasury Department and the 
<br><br><strong>Page 120</strong>
<br><br>This page reproduces COMMISSION EXHIBITS 791, 773, 788, and WALDMAN'S EXHIBIT 7
showing documents establishing purchase of rifle by Lee Harvey Oswald
<br><br><strong>Page 121</strong>
<br><br>FBI testified that the signature and other writing on the application
for that box were in the handwriting of Lee Harvey Oswald,15 as was a
change-of-address card dated May 12, 1963,16 by which Oswald requested
that mail addressed to that box be forwarded to him in New Orleans,
where he had moved on April 24.17  Since the rifle was shipped from
Chicago on March 20, 1963, it was received in Dallas during the period
when Oswald rented and used the box.  (See Commission Exhibit No. 791,
p. 120.)
<br><br>It is not known whether the application for post office box 2915
listed "A. Hidell" as a person entitled to receive mail at this box.
In accordance with postal regulations, the portion of the application
which lists names of persons, other than the applicant, entitled to
receive mail was thrown away after the box was closed on May 1963. 18
Postal Inspector Harry D. Holmes of the Dallas Post Office testified,
however, that when a package is received for a certain box, a notice
is placed in that box regardless of whether the name on the package is
listed on the application as a person entitled to receive mail through
that box.  The person having access to the box then takes the notice
to the window and is given the package. Ordinarily, Inspector Holmes testified, identification is not requested because it is
assumed that the person with the notice is entitled to the package.19
<br><br>Oswald's use of the name "Hidell" to purchase the assassination
weapon was one of several instances in which he used this name as an
alias. When arrested on the day of the assassination, he had in his
possession a Smith &amp; Wesson 38 caliber revolver purchased by
mail-order coupon from Seaport-Traders, Inc., a mail-order division of
George Rose &amp; Co., Los Angeles.  The mail-order coupon listed the
purchaser as "A. J. Hidell Age 28" with the address of post office box
2915 in Dallas. 21  Handwriting experts from the FBI and the Treasury
Department testified that the writing on the mail-order form was that
of Lee Harvey Oswald.22
<br><br>Among other identification cards in Oswald's wallet at the time
of his arrest were a Selective Service notice of classification, a
Selective Service registration certificate,23 and a certificate of
service in the U.S. Marine Corps,24 all three cards being in his own
name.  Also in his wallet at that time were a Selective Service notice
of classification and a Marine certificate of service in the name of
Alek James Hidell.25  On the Hidell Selective Service card there
appeared a  signature,  "Alek  J.  Hidell,"  and  the  photograph  of
Lee Harvey Oswald.26 Experts on questioned documents from the Treasury
Department and the FBI testified that the Hidell cards were
counterfeit photographic reproductions made by photographing the
Oswald cards, retouching the resulting negatives, and producing prints
from the retouched negatives.  The Hidell signature on the notice of
classification was in the handwriting of Oswald. (See app. X, p. 572.)
<br><br>In Oswald's personal effects found in his room at 1026 North
Beckley Avenue in Dallas was a purported international certificate of
vaccination signed by "Dr. A. J. Hideel, Post Office Box 30016, New 
<br><br><strong>Page 122</strong>
<br><br>Orleans. 28  It certified that Lee Harvey Oswald had been vaccinated
for smallpox on June 8, 1963. This, too, was a forgery. The signature
of "A. J. Hideel" was in the handwriting of Lee Harvey Oswald. 29
There is no "Dr. Hideel" licensed to practice medicine in Louisiana.30
 There is no post office box 30016 in the New Orleans Post Office but
Oswald had rented post office box 30061 in New Orleans on June 3,
1963, listing Marina Oswald and A. J. Hidell as additional persons
entitled to receive mail in the box.32  The New Orleans postal
authorities had not discarded the portion of the application listing
the names of those, other than the owner of the box, entitled to
receive mail through the box.  Expert testimony confirmed that the
writing on this application was that of Lee Harvey Oswald. 33
<br><br>Hidell's name on the post office box application was part of
Oswald's use of a nonexistent Hidell to serve as president of the
so-called New Orleans Chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
(As discussed below in ch.VI, p. 292.)  Marina Oswald testified that
she first learned of Oswald's use of the fictitious name "Hidell" in
connection with his pro-Castro activities in New Orleans.34  According
to her testimony, he compelled her to write the name "Hidell" on
membership cards in the space designated for the signature of the
"Chapter President." 35  The name "Hidell" was stamped on some of the
"Chapter's" printed literature and on the membership application
blanks.36  Marina Oswald testified, "I knew there was no such
organization.  And I know Hidell is merely an altered Fidel, and I
laughed at such foolishness." 37  Hidell was a fictitious president of
an organization of which Oswald was the only member.38
<br><br>When seeking employment in New Orleans, Oswald listed a "Sgt.
Robt. Hidell" as a reference on one job application 39 and "George
Hidell" as a reference on another.40  Both names were found to be
fictitious.41  Moreover, the use of "Alek" as a first name for Hidell
is a further link to Oswald because "Alek" was Oswald's nickname in
Russia.42  Letters received by Marina Oswald from her husband signed
"Alek" were given to the Commission.43
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="palmprint">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Oswald's Palmprint 
on Rifle Barrel</strong>
<br><br>Based on the above evidence, the Commission concluded that Oswald
purchased the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository
Building. Additional evidence of ownership was provided in the form of
palmprint identification which indicated that Oswald had possession of
the rifle he had purchased.
<br><br>A few minutes after the rifle was discovered on the sixth floor
of the Depository Building 44  it was examined by Lt. J. C. Day of the
identification bureau of the Dallas police.  He lifted the rifle by
the wooden stock after his examination convinced him that the wood was
too rough to take fingerprints.  Capt. J. W. Fritz then ejected a
cartridge by operating the bolt, but only after Day viewed the knob on
the bolt through a magnifying glass and found no prints.45 Day
continued to examine the rifle with the magnifying glass, looking for 
<br><br><strong>Page 123</strong>  
<br><br>possible fingerprints.  He applied fingerprint powder to the side of
the metal housing near the trigger, and noticed traces of two
prints.46 At 11:45 p.m. on November 22, the rifle was released to the
FBI and forwarded to Washington where it was examined on the morning
of November 23 by Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the Latent
Fingerprint Section of the FBI's Identification Division.47
<br><br>In his testimony before the Commission, Latona stated that when he
received the rifle, the area where prints were visible was protected
by cellophane.48  He examined these prints, as well as photographs of
them which the Dallas police had made, and concluded that:
    <blockquote>...the formations, the ridge formations and characteristics,
were insufficient for purposes of either effecting identification or a
determination that the print was not identical with the prints of
people.  Accordingly, my opinion simply was that the latent prints
which were there were of no value.49</blockquote>

Latona then processed the complete weapon but developed no
identifiable prints.50  He stated that the poor quality of the wood
and the metal would cause the rifle to absorb moisture from the skin,
thereby making a clear print unlikely. 51
<br><br>On November 22, however, before surrendering possession of the
rifle to the FBI Laboratory, Lieutenant Day of the Dallas Police
Department had "lifted" a palmprint from the underside of the gun
barrel "near the firing end of the barrel about 3 inches under the
woodstock when I took the woodstock loose." 52  "Lifting" a print
involves the use of adhesive material to remove the fingerprint powder
which adheres to the original print.  In this way the powdered
impression is actually removed from the object.53  The lifting had
been so complete in this case that there was no trace of the print on
the rifle itself when it was examined by Latona.  Nor was there any
indication that the lift had been performed. 54  Day, on the other
hand, believed that sufficient traces of the print had been left on
the rifle barrel, because he did not release the lifted print until
November 26, when he received instructions to send "everything that we
had" to the FBI.55  The print arrived in the FBI Laboratory in
Washington on November 29, mounted on a card on which Lieutenant Day
had written the words "off underside gun barrel near end of grip
C2766." 56  The print's positive identity as having been lifted from
the rifle was confirmed by FBI Laboratory tests which established that
the adhesive material bearing the print also bore impressions of the
same irregularities that appeared on the barrel of the rifle. 57
<br><br>Latona testified that this palmprint was the right palmprint of
Lee Harvey Oswald.58  At the request of the Commission, Arthur
Mandella, fingerprint expert with the New York City Police Department,
conducted an independent examination and also determined that this was
the right palmprint of Oswald.59  Latona's findings were also
confirmed by Ronald G. Wittmus, another FBI fingerprint 
<br><br><strong>Page 124</strong>
<br><br>expert.60  In the opinion of these experts, it was not possible to
estimate the time which elapsed between the placing of the print on
the rifle and the date of the lift.61
<br><br>Experts testifying before the Commission agreed that palmprints
are as unique as fingerprints for purposes of establishing
identification.62  Oswald's palmprint on the underside of the barrel
demonstrates that he handled the rifle when it was disassembled.  A
palmprint could not be placed on this portion of the rifle, when
assembled, because the wooden foregrip covers the barrel at this
point.63  The print is additional proof that the rifle was in Oswald's
possession.
<a name="fibers"></a>
<p></p>
<strong>Fibers on Rifle</strong>
<br><br>In a crevice between the butt plate of the rifle and the wooden
stock was a tuft of several cotton fibers of dark blue, gray-black,
and orange-yellow shades.64  On November 23, 1963, these fibers were
examined by Paul M. Stombaugh, a special agent assigned to the Hair
and Fiber Unit of the FBI Laboratory.65  He compared them with the
fibers found in the shirt which Oswald was wearing when arrested in
the Texas Theatre.66  This shirt was also composed of dark blue, gray-
black and orange-yellow cotton fibers.  Stombaugh testified that the
colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the rifle
matched those in Oswald's shirt.67  (See app. X, p. 592.) Stombaugh
explained in his testimony that in fiber analysis, as distinct from
fingerprint or firearms identification, it is not possible to state
with scientific certainty that a particular small group of fibers come
from a certain piece of clothing to the exclusion of all others
because there are not enough microscopic characteristics present in
fibers.68  Judgments as to probability will depend on the number and
types of matches.69  He concluded, "There is no doubt in my mind that
these fibers could have come from this shirt.  There is no way,
however, to eliminate the possibility of the fibers having come from
another identical shirt." 70
<br><br>Having considered the probabilities as explained in Stombaugh's
testimony, the Commission has concluded that the fibers in the tuft on
the rifle most probably came from the shirt worn by Oswald when he was
arrested, and that this was the same shirt which Oswald wore on the
morning of the assassination.  Marina Oswald testified that she
thought her husband wore this shirt to work on that day.  The
testimony of those who saw him after the assassination was
inconclusive about the color of Oswald's shirt,72 but Mary Bledsoe, a
former landlady of Oswald, saw him on a bus approximately 10 minutes
after the assassination and identified the shirt as being the one worn
by Oswald primarily because of a distinctive hole in the shirt's right
elbow. 73  Moreover, the bus transfer which he obtained as he left.
the bus was still in the pocket when he was arrested.74  Although
Oswald returned to his roominghouse after the assassination and when
questioned by the police, claimed to have changed his shirt,75 the
evidence 
<br><br><strong>Page 125</strong>
<br><br>indicates that he continued wearing the same shirt which he was
wearing all morning and which he was still wearing when arrested.
<br><br>In light of these findings the Commission evaluated the additional
testimony of Stombaugh that the fibers were caught in the crevice of
the rifle's butt plate "in the recent past."76  Although Stombaugh was
unable to estimate the period of time the fibers were on the rifle he
said that the fibers "were clean, they had good color to them, there
was no grease on them and they were not fragmented.  They looked as if
they had just been picked up." 77  The relative freshness of the
fibers is strong evidence that they were caught on the rifle on the
morning of the assassination or during the preceding evening.  For 10
days prior to the eve of the assassination Oswald had not been present
at Ruth Paine's house in Irving, Tex.,78 where the rifle was kept.  79
Moreover, the Commission found no reliable evidence that Oswald used
the rifle at any time between September 23, when it was transported
from New Orleans, and November 22, the day of the assassination.80
The fact that on the morning of the assassination Oswald was wearing
the shirt from which these relatively fresh fibers most probably
originated, provides some evidence that they were placed on the rifle
that day since there was limited, if any, opportunity for Oswald to
handle the weapon during the 2 months prior to November 22.
<br><br>On the other hand Stombaugh pointed out that fibers might retain
their freshness if the rifle had been "put aside" after catching the
fibers. The rifle used in the assassination probably had been wrapped
in a blanket for about 8 weeks prior to November 22.81 Because the
relative freshness of these fibers might be explained by the
continuous storage of the rifle in the blanket, the Commission was
unable to reach any firm conclusion as to when the fibers were caught
in the rifle.  The Commission was able to conclude, however, that the
fibers most probably came from Oswald's shirt.  This adds to the
conviction of the Commission that Oswald owned and handled the weapon
used in the assassination.
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="photograph">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Photograph of Oswald With Rifle</strong>
<br><br>During the period from March 2, 1963, to April 24, 1963, the
Oswalds lived on Neely Street in Dallas in a rented house which had a
small back yard.32  One Sunday, while his wife was hanging diapers,
Oswald asked her to take a picture of him holding a rifle, a pistol
and issues of two newspapers later identified as the Worker and the
Militant.83  Two pictures were taken.  The Commission has concluded
that the rifle shown in these pictures is the same rifle which was
found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building on November 22,
1963.  (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 133-A and 133-B, p.. 126.)
<br><br>One of these pictures, Exhibit No. 133-A, shows most of the
rifle's configuration.84 Special Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, a
photography expert with the FBI, photographed the rifle used in the
assassination, attempting to duplicate the position of the rifle and
the lighting in Exhibit No. 133-A.85  After  comparing the rifle in
the simulated 
<br><br><strong>Page 126</strong>
This page reproduces the photographs of Oswald holding rifle: COMMISSION EXHIBIT No. 133-A;
COMMISSION EXHIBIT No. 133-B; and COMMISSION EXHIBIT No. 134 (Enlargement of Commission Exhibit No. 133-A)
<br><br><strong>Page 127</strong>
<br><br>photograph  with the rifle in Exhibit No. 133-A, Shaneyfelt testified,
"I found it to be the same general configuration.  All appearances
were the same."  He found "one notch in the stock at this point that
appears very faintly in the photograph."  He stated, however, that
while he "found no differences" between the rifles in the two
photographs, he could not make a "positive identification to the
exclusion of all other rifles of the same general configuration." 86
<br><br>The authenticity of these pictures has been established by
expert testimony which links the second picture, Commission Exhibit
No. 133-B, to Oswald's Imperial Reflex camera, with which Marina
Oswald testified she took the pictures.87  The negative of that
picture, Commission Exhibit No. 133-B, was found among Oswald's
possessions.88 Using a recognized technique of determining whether a
picture was taken with a particular camera, Shaneyfelt compared this
negative with a negative which he made by taking a new picture with
Oswald's camera.89  He concluded that the negative of Exhibit No.
133-B was exposed in Oswald's Imperial Reflex camera to the exclusion
of all other cameras. 90  He could not test Exhibit No. 133-A in the
same way because the negative was never recovered. 91  Both pictures,
however, have identical backgrounds and lighting and, judging from the
shadows, were taken at the same angle.  They are photographs of the
same scene.92  Since Exhibit No. 133-B was taken with Oswald's camera,
it is reasonably certain that Exhibit No. 133-A was taken by the same
camera at the same time, as Marina Oswald testified.  Moreover,
Shaneyfelt testified that in his opinion the photographs were not
composites of two different photographs and that Oswald's face had not
been superimposed on another body.93
<br><br>One of the photographs taken by Marina Oswald was widely published
in newspapers and magazines, and in many instances the details of
these pictures differed from the original, and even from each other,
particularly as to the configuration of the rifle.  The Commission
sought to determine whether these photographs were touched prior to
publication.  Shaneyfelt testified that the published photographs
appeared to be based on a copy of the original which the publications
had each retouched differently.94  Several of the publications
furnished the Commission with the prints they had used, or described
by correspondence the retouching they had done.  This information
enabled the Commission to conclude that the published pictures were
the same as the original except for retouching done by these
publications, apparently for the purpose of clarifying the lines of
the rifle and other details in the picture.95
<br><br>The dates surrounding the taking of this picture and the
purchase of the rifle reinforce the belief that the rifle in the
photograph is the rifle which Oswald bought from Klein's.  The rifle
was shipped from Klein's in Chicago on March 20, 1963, at a time when
the Oswalds were living on Neely Street.96  From an examination of one
of the photographs, the Commission determined the dates of the issues
of the Militant and the Worker which Oswald was holding in his hand. 
<br><br><strong>Page 128</strong>
<br><br>By checking the actual mailing dates of these issues and the time
usually takes to effect. delivery to Dallas, it was established that
the photographs must have been taken sometime after March 27.97
Marina Oswald testified that the photographs were taken on a Sunday
about 2 weeks before the attempted shooting of Maj. Gen. Edwin A.
Walker on April 10, 1963.98   By Sunday, March 31, 1963, 10 days prior
to the Walker attempt, Oswald had undoubtedly received the rifle
shipped from Chicago on March 20, the revolver shipped from Los
Angeles on the same date,99 and the two newspapers which he was
holding in the picture.
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="possessions">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Rifle Among Oswald's Possessions</strong>
<br><br>Marina Oswald testified that the rifle found on the sixth floor of
the Depository Building was the "fateful rifle of Lee Oswald."
Moreover, it was the only rifle owned by her husband following his
return from the Soviet Union in June 1962.101  It had been purchased
in March 1963, and taken to New Orleans where Marina Oswald saw it in
their rented apartment during the summer of 1963.102  It appears from
his wife's testimony that Oswald may have sat on the screened-in
porch at night practicing with the rifle by looking through the
telescopic sight and operating the bolt.103  In September 1963, Oswald
loaded their possessions into a station wagon owned by Ruth Paine, who
had invited Marina Oswald and the baby to live at her home in
Irving,104 Tex.  Marina Oswald has stated that the rifle was among
these possessions,105 although Ruth Paine testified that she was not
aware of it.106
<br><br>From September 24, 1963, when Marina Oswald arrived in Irving from
New Orleans, until the morning of the assassination, the rifle was,
according to the evidence, stored in a green and brown blanket in the
Paines' garage among the Oswalds' other possessions.107 About 1 week
after the return from New Orleans, Marina Oswald was looking in the
garage for parts to the baby's crib and thought that the parts might
be in the blanket. When she started to open the blanket, she saw the
stock of the rifle.108  Ruth and Michael Paine both noticed the
rolled-up blanket in the garage during the time that Marina Oswald was
living in their home.109  On several occasions, Michael Paine moved
the blanket in the garage.110  He thought it contained tent poles, or
possibly other camping equipment such as a folding shovel.111 When he
appeared before the Commission, Michael Paine lifted the blanket with
the rifle wrapped inside and testified that it appeared to be the same
approximate weight and shape as the package in his garage.112
<br><br>About 3 hours after the assassination, a detective and deputy
sheriff saw the blanket-roll, tied with a string, lying on the floor
of the Paines' garage.  Each man testified that he thought he could
detect the outline of a rifle in the blanket, even though the blanket
was empty.113 Paul M. Stombaugh, of the FBI Laboratory, examined the
blanket and discovered a bulge approximately 10 inches long midway in
the blanket.  This bulge was apparently caused by a hard protruding
<br><br><strong>Page 129</strong>
<br><br>object which had stretched the blanket's fibers.  It could have been
caused by the telescopic sight of the rifle which was approximately 11
inches long.114  (See Commission Exhibit No. 1304 p. 132.) 
<a name="conclusion"></a>
<p></p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
<br><br>Having reviewed the evidence that (1) Lee Harvey Oswald purchased
the rifle used in the assassination, (2) Oswald's palmprint was on the
rifle in a position which shows that he had handled it while it was
disassembled, (3) fibers found on the rifle most probably came from
the shirt Oswald was wearing on the day of the assassination, (4) a
photograph taken in the yard of Oswald's apartment showed him holding
this rifle, and (5) the rifle was kept among Oswald's possessions from
the time of its purchase until the day of the assassination, the
Commission concluded that the rifle used to assassinate President
Kennedy and wound Governor Connally was owned and possessed by Lee
Harvey Oswald.
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="building">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>THE RIFLE IN THE BUILDING</strong>
<br><br>The Commission has evaluated the evidence tending to show how Lee
Harvey Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, serial number C2766, was
brought into the Depository Building, where it was found on the sixth
floor shortly after the assassination. In this connection the
Commission considered (1) the circumstances surrounding Oswald's
return to Irving, Tex., on Thursday, November 21, 1963, (2) the
disappearance of the rifle from its normal place of storage, (3)
Oswald's arrival at the Depository Building on November 22, carrying a
long and bulky brown paper package, (4) the presence of a long
handmade brown paper bag near the point from which the shots were
fired, and (5) the palmprint, fiber, and paper analyses linking Oswald
and the assassination weapon to this bag.
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="curtain">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>The Curtain Rod Story</strong>
<br><br>During October and November of 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald lived in a
roominghouse in Dallas while his wife and children lived in Irving, at
the home of Ruth Paine,113 approximately 15 miles from Oswald's place
of work at the Texas School Book Depository. Oswald traveled between
Dallas and Irving on weekends in a car driven by a neighbor of the
Paines, Buell Wesley Frazier, who also worked at the Depository.116
Oswald generally would go to Irving on Friday afternoon and return to
Dallas Monday morning. According to the testimony of Frazier, Marina
Oswald, and Ruth Paine, it appears that Oswald never returned to
Irving in midweek prior to November 21, 1963, except on Monday,
October 21, when he visited his wife in the hospital after the birth
of their second child.117
<br><br>During the morning of November 21, Oswald asked Frazier whether
he could ride home with him that afternoon. Frazier, surprised, asked 
<br><br><strong>Page 130</strong>
<br><br>him why he was going to Irving on Thursday night rather than Friday.
Oswald replied, "I'm going home to get some curtain rods... [to]
put in an apartment."  118   The two men left work at 4: 40 p.m. and
drove to Irving. There was little conversation between them on the way
home.119  Mrs. Linnie Mae Randle, Frazier's sister, commented to her
brother about Oswald's unusual midweek return to Irving. Frazier told
her that Oswald had come home to get curtain rods.120
<br><br>It would appear, however, that obtaining curtain rods was not
the purpose of Oswald's trip to Irving on November 21.  Mrs. A. C.
Johnson, his landlady, testified that Oswald's room at 1026 North
Beckley Avenue had curtains and curtain rods,121 and that Oswald had
never discussed the subject with her.122	In the Paines' garage,
along with many other objects of a household character, there were two
flat lightweight curtain rods belonging to Ruth Paine but they were
still there on Friday afternoon after Oswald's arrest.123  Oswald
never asked Mrs. Paine about the use of curtain rods,124 and Marina
Oswald testified that Oswald did not say anything about curtain rods
on the day before the assassination.125 No curtain rods were known to
have been discovered in the Depository Building after the
assassination.126 In deciding whether Oswald carried a rifle to work
in a long paper bag on November 22, the Commission gave weight to the
fact that Oswald gave a false reason for returning home on November
21, and one which provided an excuse for the carrying of a bulky
package the following morning.
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="missing">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>The Missing Rifle</strong>
<br><br>Before dinner on November 21, Oswald played on the lawn of the
Paines' home with his daughter June.127 After dinner Ruth Paine and
Marina Oswald were busy cleaning house and preparing their children
for bed.128  Between the hours of 8 and 9 p.m. they were occupied with
the children in the bedrooms located at the extreme east end of the
house.129  On the west end of the house is the attached garage, which
can be reached from the kitchen or from the outside.130 In the garage
were the personal belongings of the Oswald family including, as the
evidence has shown, the rifle wrapped in the old brown and green
blanket.131
<br><br>At approximately 9 p.m., after the children had been put to
bed, Mrs. Paine, according to her testimony before the Commission,
"went out to the garage to paint some children's blocks, and worked in
the garage for half an hour or so.  I noticed when I went out that the
light was on." 132  Mrs. Paine was certain that she had not left the
light on in the garage after dinner.138  According to Mrs. Paine,
Oswald had gone to bed by 9 p.m.;  134  Marina Oswald testified that
it was between 9 and 10 p.m.135  Neither Marina Oswald nor Ruth Paine
saw Oswald in the garage.136  The period between 8 and 9 p.m.,
however, provided ample opportunity for Oswald to prepare the rifle
for his departure the next morning. Only if disassembled could 
<br><br><strong>Page 131</strong>
<br><br>the rifle fit into the paper bag found near the window  137  from
which the shots were fired. A firearms expert with the FBI assembled
the rifle in 6 minutes using a 10-cent coin as a tool, and he could
disassemble it more rapidly.138  While the rifle may have already been
disassembled when Oswald arrived home on Thursday, he had ample time
that evening to disassemble the rifle and insert it into the paper
bag.
<br><br>On the day of the assassination, Marina Oswald was watching
television when she learned of the shooting.  A short time later Mrs.
Paine told her that someone had shot the President "from the building
in which Lee is working."  Marina Oswald testified that at that time
"My heart dropped.  I then went to the garage to see whether the rifle
was there and I saw that the blanket was still there and I said 'Thank
God.'"  She did not unroll the blanket.  She saw that it was in its
usual position and it appeared to her to have something inside.139
<br><br>Soon afterward, at about 3 p.m., police officers arrived and
searched the house.  Mrs. Paine pointed out that most of the Oswalds'
possessions were in the garage.140  With Ruth Paine acting as an
interpreter, Detective Rose asked Marina whether her husband had a
rifle. Mrs. Paine, who had no knowledge of the rifle, first said "No,"
but when the question was translated, Marina Oswald replied "Yes."
141 She pointed to the blanket which was on the floor very close to
where Ruth Paine was standing. Mrs. Paine testified:
    <blockquote>As she [Marina] told me about it I stepped onto the blanket roll...
And she indicated to me that she had peered into this roll and saw a
portion of what she took to be a gun she knew her husband to have, a
rifle.  And I then translated this to the officers that she knew that
her husband had a gun that he had stored in here... I then stepped
off of it and the officer picked it up in the middle and it bent so... 142</blockquote>

Mrs. Paine had the actual blanket before her as she testified and she
indicated that the blanket. hung limp in the officer's hand.143 Marina
Oswald testified that this was her first knowledge that the rifle was
not in its accustomed place.144
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="long">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>The Long and Bulky Package</strong>
<br><br>On the morning of November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald left the
Paine house in Irving at approximately 7:15 a.m., while Marina Oswald
was still in bed.145  Neither she nor Mrs. Paine saw him leave the
house.146  About half-a-block away from the Paine house was the
residence of Mrs. Linnie Mae Randle, the sister of the man with whom
Oswald drove to work--Buell Wesley Frazier.  Mrs. Randle stated that
on the morning of November 22, while her brother was eating breakfast,
she looked out the breakfast-room window and saw Oswald cross the
street and walk toward the driveway where her brother parked his car
near the carport.  He carried a "heavy brown bag."  147  Oswald 
<br><br><strong>Page 132</strong>
<br><br>This page reproduces COMMISSION EXHIBIT No. 1304: C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle and paper bag found on the sixth floor
of the Texas School Book Depository.
<br><br><strong>Page 133</strong>
<br><br>gripped the bag in his right hand near the top.  "It tapered like this
as he hugged it in his hand.  It was ... more bulky toward the
bottom" than toward the top.148  She then opened the kitchen door and
saw Oswald open the right rear door of her brother's car and place the
package in the back of the car.149  Mrs. Randle estimated that the
package was approximately 28 inches long and about 8 inches wide.150
She thought. that its color was similar to that of the bag found on
the sixth floor of the School Book Depository after the
assassination.151
<br><br>Frazier met Oswald at the kitchen door and together they walked
to the car.152 After entering the car, Frazier glanced over his
shoulder and noticed a brown paper package on the back seat.  He
asked, "What's the package, Lee?"  Oswald replied, "curtain rods."153
Frazier told the Commission "... the main reason he was going over
there that Thursday afternoon when he was to bring back some curtain
rods, so I didn't think any more about it when he told me that."154
Frazier estimated that the bag was 2 feet long "give and take a few
inches," and about 5 or 6 inches wide.155  As they sat in the car,
Frazier asked Oswald where his lunch was, and Oswald replied that he
was going to buy his lunch that day.156 Frazier testified that Oswald
carried no lunch bag that day. "When he rode with me, I say he always
brought lunch except that one day on November 22 he didn't bring his
lunch that day." 157
<br><br>Frazier parked the car in the company parking lot about 2 blocks
north of the Depository Building.  Oswald left the car first, picked
up the brown paper bag, and proceeded toward the building ahead of
Frazier.  Frazier walked behind and as they crossed the railroad
tracks he watched the switching of the cars.  Frazier recalled that
one end of the package was under Oswald's armpit and the lower part
was held with his right hand so that it was carried straight and
parallel to his body.  When Oswald entered the rear door of the
Depository Building, he was about 50 feet ahead of Frazier.  It was
the first time that Oswald had not walked with Frazier from the
parking lot to the building entrance.158 When Frazier entered the
building, he did not see Oswald.159  One employee, Jack Dougherty,
believed that he saw Oswald coming to work, but he does not remember
that Oswald had anything in his hands as he entered the door.160  No
other employee has been found who saw Oswald enter that morning.161
<br><br>In deciding whether Oswald carried the assassination weapon in
the bag which Frazier and Mrs. Randle saw, the Commission has
carefully considered the testimony of these two witnesses with regard
to the length of the bag.  Frazier and Mrs. Randle testified that the
bag which Oswald was carrying was approximately 27 or 28 inches
long,162 whereas the wooden stock of the rifle, which is its largest
component, measured 34.8 inches.163  The bag found on the sixth floor
was 88 inches long.164   (See Commission Exhibit No.  1304,  p.  132.)
When Frazier appeared before the Commission and was asked to
demonstrate how Oswald carried the package, he said, "Like I said, I
remember that I didn't look at the package very much ...
<br><br><strong>Page 134</strong> 
<br><br>but when I did look at it he did have his hands on the package like
that," 165 and at this point Frazier placed the upper part of the
package under his armpit and attempted to cup his right hand beneath
the bottom of the bag. The disassembled rifle was too long to be
carried in this manner.  Similarly, when the butt of the rifle was
placed in Frazier's hand, it extended above his shoulder to ear level.
1 Moreover, in an interview on December 1, 1963, with agents of the
FBI, Frazier had marked the point on the back seat of his car which he
believed was where the bag reached when it was laid on the seat with
one edge against the door.  The distance between the point on the seat
and the door was 27 inches.167
<br><br>Mrs. Randle said, when shown the paper bag, that the bag she saw
Oswald carrying "wasn't that long, I mean it was folded down at the
top as I told you.  It definitely wasn't that long." 168  And she
folded the bag to length of about 28&frac12; inches.  Frazier doubted whether
the bag that Oswald carried was as wide as the bag found on the sixth
floor,169 although Mrs. Randle testified that the width was
approximately the same.170
<br><br>The Commission has weighed the visual recollection of Frazier and
Mrs. Randle against the evidence here presented that the bag Oswald
carried contained the assassination weapon and has concluded that
Frazier and Randle are mistaken as to the length of the bag.  Mrs.
Randle saw the bag fleetingly and her first remembrance is that it was
held in Oswald's right hand "and it almost touched the ground as he
carried it." 171  Frazier's view of the bag was from the rear. He
continually advised that he was not paying close attention.172 For
example, he said,
    <blockquote>...I didn't pay too much attention the way he was walking because I
was walking along there looking at the railroad cars and watching the
men on the diesel switch them cars and I didn't pay too much attention
on how he carried the package at all.173</blockquote>

Frazier could easily have been mistaken when he stated that Oswald
held the bottom of the bag cupped in his hand with the upper end
tucked into his armpit.
<a name="location"></a>
<p></p>
<strong>Location of Bag</strong>
<br><br>A handmade bag of wrapping paper and tape 174 was found in the
southeast corner of the sixth floor alongside the window from which
the shots were fired.175  (See Commission Exhibit No. 2707, p.
142.)  It was not a standard type bag which could be obtained in a
store and it was presumably made for a particular purpose. It was the
appropriate size to contain, in disassembled form, Oswald's
Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, serial No. C2766, which was also found on
the sixth floor.176  Three cartons had been placed at the window
apparently to act as a gun rest and a fourth carton was placed behind
those at the window.177  (See Commission Exhibit No. 1301, 
<br><br><strong>Page 135</strong>
<br><br>p. 138.) A person seated on the fourth carton could assemble the rifle
without being seen from the rest of the sixth floor because the
cartons stacked around the southeast corner would shield him.178  (See
Commission Exhibit No. 723, p. 80.)  The presence of the bag in this
corner is cogent evidence that it was used as the container for the
rifle. At the time the bag was found, Lieutenant Day of the Dallas
police wrote on it, "Found next to the sixth floor window gun fired
from. May have been used to carry gun.  Lt. J. C. Day." 179
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="scientific">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Scientific Evidence Linking Rifle and Oswald to Paper Bag</strong>

<br><br><em>Oswald's fingerprint and palmprint found on bag</em>.--Using a standard
chemical method involving silver nitrates  180  the FBI Laboratory
developed a latent palmprint and latent fingerprint on the bag.  (See
app. X, p. 565.) Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the FBI's Latent
Fingerprint Section, identified these prints as the left index
fingerprint and right palmprint of Lee Harvey Oswald.181  The portion
of the palm which was identified was the heel of the right palm, i.e.,
the area near the wrist, on the little finger side.182  These prints
were examined independently by Ronald G. Wittmus of the FBI,183 and by
Arthur Mandella, a fingerprint expert with the New York City Police
Department. 184  Both concluded that the prints were the right palm
and left index finger of Lee Oswald.  No other identifiable prints
were found on the bag.185
<br><br>Oswald's palmprint on the bottom of the paper bag indicated, of
course, that he had handled the bag.  Furthermore, it was consistent
with the bag having contained a heavy or bulky object when he handled
it since a light object is usually held by the fingers.186 The
palmprint was found on the closed end of the bag.  It was from
Oswald's right hand, in which he carried the long package as he walked
from Frazier's car to the building.187
<br><br><em>Materials used to make bag</em>.--On the day of the assassination, the
Dallas police obtained a sample of wrapping paper and tape from the
shipping room of the Depository and forwarded it to the FBI Laboratory
in Washington.188 James C. Cadigan, a questioned-documents expert with
the Bureau, compared the samples with the paper and tape in the actual
bag.  He testified, "In all of the observations and physical tests
that I made I found ... the bag ... and the paper sample ...
were the same." 189 
<br><br>Among other tests, the paper and tape were submitted to fiber
analysis and spectrographic examination.190  In addition the tape was
compared to determine whether the sample tape and the tape on the bag
had been taken from the tape dispensing machine at the Depository.
When asked to explain the similarity of characteristics, Cadigan
stated: 191
    <blockquote>Well, briefly, it would be the thickness of both the paper and
the tape, the color under various lighting conditions of both the
paper and the tape, the width of the tape, the knurled markings </blockquote>

<strong>Page 136</strong>
    <blockquote>on the surface of the fiber, the texture of the fiber, the letting
pattern ...<br>
&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
I found that the paper sack found on the sixth floor ... and the
sample ... had the same observable characteristics both under the
microscope and all the visual tests that I could conduct.<br>
&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
The papers I also found were similar in fiber composition,
therefore, in addition to the visual characteristics, microscopic and
UV [ultra violet] characteristics.</blockquote>

Mr. Cadigan concluded that the paper and tape from the bag were
identical in all respects to the sample paper and tape taken from the
Texas School Book Depository shipping room on November 22, 1963.192
<br><br>On December l, 1963, a replica bag was made from materials found
on that date in the shipping room.  This was done as an investigatory
aid since the original bag had been discolored during various
laboratory examinations and could not be used for valid identification
by witnesses.193  Cadigan found that the paper used to make this
replica sack had different characteristics from the paper in the
original bag.194  The science of paper analysis enabled him to
distinguish between different rolls of paper even though they were
produced by the same manufacturer.125
<br><br>Since the Depository normally used approximately one roll of paper
every 3 working days,196 it was not surprising that the replica sack
made on December 1, 1963, had different characteristics from both the
actual bag and the sample taken on November 22.  On the other hand,
since two rolls could be made from the same batch of paper, one cannot
estimate when, prior to November 22, Oswald made the paper bag.
However, the complete identity of characteristics between the paper
and tape in the bag found on the sixth floor and the paper and tape
found in the shipping room of the Depository on November 22 enabled
the Commission to conclude that the bag was made from these materials.
 The Depository shipping department was on the first floor to which
Oswald had access in the normal performance of his duties filling
orders.197
<br><br><em>Fibers in paper bag matched fibers in blanket</em>.--When Paul M.
Stombaugh of the FBI Laboratory examined the paper bag, he found, on
the inside, a single brown delustered viscose fiber and several light
green cotton fibers.198 The blanket in which the rifle was stored was
composed of brown and green cotton, viscose and woolen fibers.199
<br><br>The single brown viscose fiber found in the bag matched some of the
brown viscose fibers from the blanket in all observable
characteristics.200  The green cotton fibers found in the paper bag
matched some of the green cotton fibers in the blanket "in all
observable microscopic 
<br><br><strong>Page 137</strong>
<br><br>characteristics." 201  Despite these matches, however, Stombaugh was
unable to render on opinion that the fibers which he found in the bag
had probably come from the blanket, because other types of fibers
present in the blanket were not found in the bag.  He concluded:
    <blockquote>All I would say here is that it is possible that these fibers could
have come from this blanket., because this blanket is composed of
brown and green woolen fibers, brown and green delustered viscose
fibers, and brown and green cotton fibers... We found no brown
cotton fibers, no green viscose fibers, and no woolen fibers.<br>
So if I found all of these then I would have been able to say
these fibers probably had come from this blanket.  But since I found
so few, then I would say the possibility exists, these fibers could
have come from this blanket.202</blockquote>

Stombaugh confirmed that the rifle could have picked up fibers
from the blanket and transferred them to the paper bag.203  In light
of the other evidence linking Lee Harvey Oswald, the blanket, and the
rifle to the paper bag found on the sixth floor, the Commission
considered Stombaugh's testimony of probative value in deciding
whether Oswald carried the rifle into the building in the paper bag.
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="conclusion2">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>
<br><br>The preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that Lee
Harvey Oswald (1) told the curtain rod story to Frazier to explain
both the return to Irving on a Thursday and the obvious bulk of the
package which he intended to bring to work the next day; (2) took
paper and tape from the wrapping bench of the Depository and fashioned
a bag large enough to carry the disassembled rifle; (3) removed the
rifle from the blanket in the Paines' garage on Thursday evening; (4)
carried the rifle into the Depository Building, concealed in the bag;

<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="window">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>OSWALD AT WINDOW</strong>
<br><br>Lee Harvey Oswald was hired on October 15, 1963, by the Texas
School Book Depository as an "order filler." 204 He worked principally
on the first and sixth floors of the building, gathering books listed
on orders and delivering them to the shipping room on the first
floor.205  He had ready access to the sixth floor, 208 from the
southeast corner window of which the shots were fired. 207  The
Commission evaluated the physical evidence found near the window after
the assassination and the testimony of eyewitnesses in deciding
whether Lee Harvey Oswald was present at this window at the time of
the assassination.

<strong>Palmprints and 
Fingerprints on Cartons and Paper Bag</strong>
<br><br>Below the southeast corner window on the sixth floor was a large
carton of books measuring approximately 18 by 12 by 14 inches which
had been moved from a stack along the south wall.208  Atop this carton
was a small carton marked "Rolling Readers," measuring approximately
13 by 9 by 8 inches.209  In front of this small carton and resting
partially on the windowsill was another small "Rolling Readers"
carton.210  These two small cartons had been moved from a stack about
three aisles away. 211  The boxes in the window appeared to have been
arranged as a convenient gun rest.212  (See Commission Exhibit No.
1301, p. 138.)  Behind these boxes was another carton placed on the
floor on which a man sitting could look southwesterly down Elm Street
over the top of the "Rolling Readers" cartons.213  Next to these
cartons was the handmade paper bag, previously discussed, on which
appeared the print of the left index finger and right palm of Lee
Harvey Oswald.214  (See Commission Exhibit No. 1302, p. 139.)
<br><br>The cartons were forwarded to the FBI in Washington.
Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the Latent Fingerprint Section,
testified that 20 identifiable fingerprints and 8 palmprints were
developed on these cartons.205  The carton on the windowsill and the
large carton below the window contained no prints which could be
identified as being those of Lee Harvey Oswald.216  The other "Rolling
Readers" carton, however, contained a palmprint and a fingerprint
which were identified by Latona as being the left palmprint and right
index fingerprint of Lee Harvey Oswald.217  (See app. X, p. 566.) 
<br><br>The Commission has considered the possibility that the cartons
might have been moved in connection with the work that was being
performed on the sixth floor on November 22. Depository employees were
laying a new floor at the west end and transferring books from the
west to the east end of the building.218 The "Rolling Readers"
cartons, however, had not been moved by the floor layers and had
apparently been taken to the window from their regular position for
some particular purpose.219  The "Rolling Readers" boxes contained,
instead of books, light blocks used as reading aids.220  They could be
easily adjusted and were still solid enough to serve as a gun rest.
<br><br>The box on the floor, behind the three near the window, had
been one of these moved by the floor layers from the west wall to near
the east side of the building in preparation for the laying of the
floor.221 During the afternoon of November 22, Lieutenant Day of the
Dallas police dusted this carton with powder and developed a palmprint
on the top edge of the carton on the side nearest the window.222  The
position of this palmprint on the carton was parallel with the long
axis of the box, and at right angles with the short axis; the bottom
of the palm rested on the box.223  Someone sitting on the box facing
the window would have his palm in this position if he placed his hand
alongside his right hip.  (See Commission Exhibit No. 1302, p. 139.)
This print 
<br><br><strong>Page 141</strong>
<br><br>which had been cut out of the box was also forwarded to the FBI and
Latona identified it as Oswald's right palmprint.224  In Latona's
opinion "not too long" a time had elapsed between the time that the
print was placed on the carton and the time that it had been developed
by the Dallas police.225 Although Bureau experiments had shown that 24
hours was a likely maximum time, Latona stated that he could only
testify with certainty that the print was less than 3 days old.226
<br><br>The print, therefore, could have been placed on the carton at any
time within this period.  The freshness of this print could be
estimated only because the Dallas police developed it through the use
of powder.  Since cartons absorb perspiration, powder can successfully
develop a print on such material 227 only within a limited time. When
the FBI in Washington received the cartons, the remaining prints,
including Oswald's on the Rolling Readers carton, were developed by
chemical processes.  The freshness of prints developed in this manner
228 cannot be estimated, so no conclusions can be drawn as to whether
these remaining prints preceded or followed the print developed in
Dallas by powder.  Most of the prints were found to have been placed
on the cartons by an FBI clerk and a Dallas police officer after the
cartons had been processed with powder by the Dallas Police.229  (See
ch. VI, p. 249; app. X, p. 566.)
<br><br>In his independent investigation, Arthur Mandella of the New York
City Police Department reached the same conclusion as Latona that the
prints found on the cartons were those of Lee Harvey Oswald.229 In
addition, Mandella was of the opinion that the print taken from the
carton on the floor was probably made within a day or a day and a half
of the examination on November 22.230 Moreover, another expert with
the FBI, Ronald G. Wittmus, conducted a separate examination and also
agreed with Latona that the prints were Oswald's.231
<br><br>In evaluating the significance of these fingerprint and
palmprint identifications, the Commission considered the possibility
that Oswald handled these cartons as part of his normal duties.  Since
other identifiable prints were developed on the cartons, the
Commission requested that they be compared with the prints of the 12
warehouse employs who, like Oswald, might have handled the cartons.
They were also compared with the prints of those law enforcement
officials who might have handled the cartons. The results of this
investigation are fully discussed in chapter VI, page 249. Although a 
person could handle a carton and not leave identifiable prints, none
of these employees except Oswald left identifiable prints on the
cartons.232  This finding, in addition to the freshness of one of the
prints and the presence of Oswald's prints on two of the four cartons
and the paper bag led the Commission to attach some probative value to
the fingerprint and palmprint identifications in reaching the
conclusion that Oswald was at the window from which the shots were
fired, although the prints do not establish the exact time he was
there.

<strong>Oswald's Presence on Sixth 
Floor Approximately 35 Minutes Before the Assassination</strong>
<br><br>Additional testimony linking Oswald with the point from which the
shots were fired was provided by the testimony of Charles Givens, who
was the last known employee to see Oswald inside the building prior to
the assassination.  During the morning of November 22, Givens was
working with the floor-laying crew in the southwest section of the
sixth floor.233  At about. 11:45 a.m. the. floor-laying crew used both
elevators to come down from the sixth floor.  The employees raced the
elevators to the first floor.234  Givens saw Oswald standing at the
gate on the fifth floor as the elevator went by.235 Givens testified
that after reaching the first floor, "I discovered I left my
cigarettes in my jacket pocket upstairs, and I took the elevator back
upstairs to get my jacket with my cigarettes in it." 236  He saw
Oswald, a clipboard in hand, walking from the southeast corner of the
sixth floor toward the elevator.237  (See Commission Exhibit No. 2707,
p. 142.)  Givens said to Oswald, "Boy are you going downstairs? ...
It's near lunch time."  Oswald said, "No, sir. When you get
downstairs, close the gate to the elevator." 238  Oswald was referring
to the west elevator which operates by pushbutton and only with the
gate closed.239  Givens said, "Okay," and rode down in the east
elevator.  When he reached the first floor, the west elevator--the one
with the gate  was not there.  Givens thought this was about 11:55
a.m.240  None of the Depository employees is known to have seen Oswald
again until after the shooting.241
<br><br>The significance of Givens' observation that Oswald was
carrying his clipboard became apparent on December 2, 1963, when an
employee, Frankie Kaiser, found a clipboard hidden by book cartons in
the northwest corner of the sixth floor at the west wall a few feet
from where the rifle had been found.242  This clipboard had been made
by Kaiser and had his name on it.243  Kaiser identified it as the
clipboard which Oswald had appropriated from him when Oswald came to
work at the Depository.244  Three invoices on this clipboard, each
dated November 22, were for Scott-Foresman books, located on the first
and sixth floors.245  Oswald had not filled any of the three
orders.246
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="eyewitness">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Eyewitness Identification of Assassin</strong>
<br><br>Howard L. Brennan was an eyewitness to the shooting.  As
indicated previously the Commission considered his testimony as
probative in reaching the conclusion that the shots came from the
sixth floor, southeast corner window of the Depository Building.247
(See ch. III, pp. 61-68.)  Brennan also testified that Lee Harvey
Oswald, whom he viewed in a police lineup on the night. of the
assassination, was the man he saw fire the shots from the sixth-floor
window of the Depository Building.248  When the shots were fired,
Brennan was in an excellent position to observe anyone in the window.
He was sitting 
<br><br><strong>Page 144</strong>
<br><br>on a concrete wall on the southwest corner of Elm and Houston Streets,
looking north at the Depository Building which was directly in front
of him.249  The window was approximately 120 feet away.250  (See
Commission Exhibit No. 477, p. 62.)
<br><br>In the 6- to 8-minute period before the motorcade arrived,251
Brennan saw a man leave and return to the window "a couple of times."
253 After hearing the first shot, which he thought was a motorcycle
backfire, Brennan glanced up at the window. He testified that "this
man I saw previously was aiming for his last shot ... as it appeared
to me he was standing up and resting against the left window sill ...252
<br><br>Brennan saw the man fire the last shot and disappear from the
window. Within minutes of the assassination, Brennan described the man
to the police.254  This description most probably led to the radio
alert sent to police cars at approximately 12:45 p.m., which described
the suspect as white, slender, weighing about 165 pounds, about 5'10"
tall, and in his early thirties.255  In his sworn statement to the
police later that day, Brennan described the man in similar terms,
except that he gave the weight as between 165 and 175 pounds and the
height was omitted.256  In his testimony before the Commission,
Brennan described the person he saw as "... a man in his early
thirties, fair complexion, slender, but neat, neat slender, possible 5
foot 10 ... 160 to 170 pounds." 257  Oswald was 5'9'' slender and 24
years old. When arrested, he gave his weight as 140 pounds.258 On
other occasions he gave weights of both 140 and 150 pounds.259 The New
Orleans police records of his arrest in August of 1963 show a weight
of 136 pounds.260  The autopsy report indicated an estimated weight of
150 pounds.261
<br><br>Brennan's description should also be compared with the eyewitness
description broadcast over the Dallas police radio at 1:22 p.m. of the
man who shot Patrolman J. D. Tippit. The suspect was described as "a
white male about 30, 5'8", black hair, slender ..." 262 At 1:29
p.m. the police radio reported that the description of the suspect in
the Tippit shooting was similar to the description which had been
given by Brennan in connection with the assassination.263
Approximately 7 or 8 minutes later the police radio reported that "an
eyeball witness" described the suspect in the Tippit shooting as "a
white male, 27, 5'11", 165 pounds, black wavy hair." 264 As will be
discussed fully below, the Commission has concluded that this suspect
was Lee Harvey Oswald.
<br><br>Although Brennan testified that the man in the window was
standing when he fired the shots,265 most probably he was either
sitting or kneeling.  The half-open window,266 the arrangement of the
boxes,267 and the angle of the shots virtually preclude a standing
position.268 It is understandable, however, for Brennan to have
believed that the man with the rifle was standing. A photograph of the
building taken seconds after the assassination shows three employees
looking out of the fifth-floor window directly below the window from
which the shots were fired. Brennan testified that they were
standing,269 which is their apparent position in the photograph.270  
<br><br><strong>Page 145 </strong> 
<br><br>(See Dillard Exhibits Nos. C and D, pp. 66-67.)  But the testimony of
these employees,271 together with photographs subsequently taken of
them at the scene of the assassination,272 establishes that they were
either squatting or kneeling.  (See Commission Exhibit No. 485, p.
69.)  Since the window ledges in the Depository Building are lower
than in most buildings,273 a person squatting or kneeling exposes more
of his body than would normally be the case.  From the street, this
creates the impression that the person is standing.  Brennan could
have seen enough of the body of a kneeling or squatting person to
estimate his height.
<br><br>Shortly after the assassination Brennan noticed two of these
employees leaving the building and immediately identified them as
having been in the fifth-floor windows.274  When the three employees
appeared before the Commission, Brennan identified the two whom he saw
leave the building.275  The two men, Harold Norman and James Jarman,
Jr., each confirmed that when they came out of the building, they saw
and heard Brennan describing what he had seen.276  Norman stated, "... 
I remember him talking and I believe I remember seeing him saying
that he saw us when we first went up to the fifth-floor window, he saw
us then." 277  Jarman heard Brennan "talking to this officer about
that he had heard these shots and he had seen the barrel of the gun
sticking out the window, and he said that the shots came from inside
the building." 278
<br><br>During the evening of November 22, Brennan identified Oswald as
the person in the lineup who bore the closest resemblance to the man
in the window but he said he was unable to make a positive
identification.279  Prior to the lineup, Brennan had seen Oswald's
picture on television and he told the Commission that whether this
affected his identification "is something I do not know." 238  In an
interview with FBI agents on December 17, 1963, Brennan stated that he
was sure that the person firing the rifle was Oswald.281  In another
interview with FBI agents on January 7, 1964, Brennan appeared to
revert to his earlier inability to make a positive identification,282
but, in his testimony before the Commission, Brennan stated that his
remarks of January 7 were intended by him merely as an accurate report
of what he said on November 22.283
<br><br>Brennan told the Commission that he could have made a positive
identification in the lineup on November 22 but did not do so because
he felt that the assassination was "a Communist activity, and I felt
like there hadn't been more than one eyewitness, and if it got to be a
known fact that I was an eyewitness, my family or I, either one, might
not be safe." 284  When specifically asked before the Commission
whether or not he could positively identify the man he saw in the
sixth-floor window as the same man he saw in the police station,
Brennan stated, "I could at that time--I could, with all sincerity,
identify him as being the same man." 285
<br><br>Although the record indicates that Brennan was an accurate
observer, he declined to make a positive identification of Oswald when
he first saw him in the police lineup.286  The Commission, therefore,
<br><br><strong>Page 146</strong>
<br><br>does not base its conclusion concerning the identity of the assassin
on Brennan's subsequent certain identification of Lee Harvey Oswald as
the man he saw fire the rifle.  Immediately after the assassination,
however, Brennan described to the police the man he saw in the window
and then identified Oswald as the person who most nearly resembled the
man he saw.  The Commission is satisfied that, at the least, Brennan
saw a man in the window who closely resembled Lee Harvey Oswald, and
that Brennan believes the man he saw was in fact Lee Harvey Oswald.
<br><br>Two other witnesses were able to offer partial descriptions of a
man they saw in the southeast corner window of the sixth floor
approximately 1 minute before the assassination, although neither
witness saw the shots being fired.287  Ronald Fischer and Robert
Edwards were standing on the curb at the southwest corner of Elm and
Houston Streets,288 the same corner where Brennan was sitting on a
concrete wall. 289   Fischer testified that about 10 or 15 seconds
before the motorcade turned onto Houston Street from Main Street,
Edwards said, "Look at that guy there in that window." 290
<br><br>Fischer looked up and watched the man in the window for 10 or 15
seconds and then started watching the motorcade, which came into view
on Houston Street.291  He said that the man held his attention until
the motorcade came because the man:
    <blockquote>...appeared uncomfortable for one, and secondly, he wasn't
watching ... he didn't look like he was watching for the parade.  He
looked like he was looking down toward the Trinity River and the
Triple Underpass down at the end--toward the end of Elm Street.
And ... all the time I watched him, he never moved his head, he
never--he never moved anything. Just was there transfixed.292</blockquote>

Fischer placed the man in the easternmost window on the south
side of the Depository Building on either the fifth or the sixth
floor.293 He said that he could see the man from the middle of his
chest to the top of his head, and that as he was facing the window the
man was in the lower right-hand portion of the window and "seemed to
be sitting a little forward." 294  The man was dressed in a
light-colored, open-neck shirt which could have been either a sports
shirt or a T-shirt, and he had brown hair, a slender face and neck
with light complexion, and looked to be 22 or 24 years old.295  The
person in the window was a white man and "looked to me like he was
looking straight at the Triple Underpass" down Elm Street.296  Boxes
and cases were stacked behind him.287
<br><br>Approximately 1 week after the assassination, according to Fisher,
policemen showed him a picture of Oswald.298  In his testimony he
said, "I told them that that could have been the man... That that
could have been the man that I saw in the window in the School Book
Depository Building, but that I was not sure." 299  Fischer described
the man's hair as some shade of brown--"it wasn't dark 
<br><br><strong>Page 147</strong>
<br><br>and it wasn't light." 300  On November 22, Fischer had apparently
described the man as "light-headed." 301 Fischer explained that he did
not mean by the earlier statement. that the man was blond, but rather
that his hair was not black.302
<br><br>Robert Edwards said that, while looking at the south side of the
Depository Building shortly before the motorcade, he saw nothing of
importance "except maybe one individual who was up there in the corner
room of the sixth floor which was crowded in among boxes." 303 He said
that this was a white man about average in size, "possibly thin," and
that he thought the man had light-brown hair.304 Fischer and Edwards
did not see the man clearly enough or long enough to identify him.
Their testimony is of probative value, however, because their limited
description is consistent with that of the man who has been found by
the Commission, based on other evidence, to have fired the shots from
the window.
<br><br>Another person who saw the assassin as the shots were fired was
Amos L. Euins, age 15, who was one of the first witnesses to alert
the police to the Depository as the source of the shots, as has been
discussed in chapter III.305  Euins, who was on the southwest  corner
of Elm and Houston Streets 306 testified that he could not describe
the man he saw in the window. According to Euins, however, as the man
lowered his head in order to aim the rifle down Elm Street, he
appeared to have a white bald spot, on his head.307 Shortly after the
assassination, Euins signed an affidavit describing the man as
"white," 308 but a radio reporter testified that Euins described the
man to him as "colored." 309  In his Commission testimony, Euins
stated that he could not ascertain the man's race and that the
statement in the affidavit was intended to refer only to the white
spot on the man's head and not to his race.310  A Secret Service agent
who spoke to Euins approximately 20 to 30 minutes after the
assassination confirmed that Euins could neither describe the man in
the window nor indicate his race.311  Accordingly, Euins' testimony is
considered probative as to the source of the shots but is inconclusive
as to the identity of the man in the window.
<br><br>In evaluating the evidence that Oswald was at the southeast
corner window of the sixth floor at the time of the shooting, the
Commission has considered the allegation that Oswald was photographed
standing in front of the building when the shots were fired.  The
picture which gave rise to these allegations was taken by Associated
Press Photographer James W. Altgens, who was standing on the south
side of Elm Street between the Triple Underpass and the Depository
Building.312 As the motorcade started its descent down Elm Street.,
Altgens snapped a picture of the Presidential limousine with the
entrance to the Depository Building in the background.313 Just before
snapping the picture Altgens heard a noise which sounded like the
popping of a firecracker.  Investigation has established that Altgens'
picture was taken approximately 2 seconds after the firing of the shot
which entered the back of the President's neck.314  
<br><br><strong>Page 148</strong>
<br><br>This page reproduces COMMISSION EXHIBIT No. 1061: Texas School Book Depository, Diagram
of First Floor
<br><br><strong>Page 149</strong>
<br><br>In the background of this picture were several employees watching
the parade from the steps of the Depository Building.  One of these
employees was alleged to resemble Lee Harvey Oswald. 315  The
Commission has determined that the employee was in fact Billy
Lovelady, who identified himself in the picture.316  Standing
alongside him were Buell Wesley Frazier  317  and William Shelley,318
who also identified Lovelady.  The Commission is satisfied that Oswald
does not appear in this photograph. (See Commission Exhibit. No. 900,
p. 113.)
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="actions">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Oswald's Actions in Building After Assassination</strong>
<br><br>In considering whether Oswald was at the southeast corner
window at the time the shots were fired, the Commission has reviewed
the testimony of witnesses who saw Oswald in the building within
minutes after the assassination.  The Commission has found that
Oswald's movements, as described by these witnesses, are consistent
with his having been at the window at 12:30 p.m.
<br><br>The encounter in the lunchroom.--The first person to see Oswald
after the assassination was Patrolman M. L. Baker of the Dallas Police
Department.  Baker was riding a two-wheeled motorcycle behind the last
press car of the motorcade.319 As he turned the corner from Main onto
Houston at a speed of about 5 to 10 miles per hour,320 a strong wind
blowing from the north almost unseated him.321  At about this time he
heard the first shot.322  Having recently heard the sounds of rifles
while on a hunting trip, Baker recognized the shots as that of a
high-powered rifle; "it sounded high and I immediately kind of looked
up, and I had a feeling that it came from the building, either right
in front of me [the Depository Building] or of the one across to the
right of it." 323  He saw pigeons flutter upward.  He was not certain,
"but I am pretty sure they came from the building right on the
northwest corner." 324  He heard two more shots spaced "pretty well
even to me." 325 After the third shot, he "revved that motorcycle up,"
drove to the northwest corner of Elm and Houston, and parked
approximately 10 feet from the traffic signal.326 As he was parking he
noted that people were "falling, and they were rolling around down
there ... grabbing their children" and rushing about.327 A woman
screamed, "Oh, they have shot that man, they have shot that man." 328
Baker "had it in mind that the shots came from the top of this
building here," so he ran straight to the entrance of the Depository
Building.329 
<br><br>Baker testified that he entered the lobby of the building and
"spoke out and asked where the stairs or elevator was ... and this
man, Mr. Truly, spoke up and says, it seems to me like he says, 'I am
a building manager.  Follow me, officer, and I will show you.'" 330
Baker and building superintendent Roy Truly went through a second set
of doors 331 and stopped at a swinging door where Baker bumped into
Truly's back.332  They went through the swinging door and continued at
"a good trot" to the northwest corner of the floor where Truly hoped
to find one of the two freight elevators. 
<br><br><strong>Page 150</strong>
<br><br>This page reproduces COMMISSION EXHIBIT No. 1118: Texas School Book Depository
Diagram of Second Floor Showing Route of Oswald
<br><br><strong>Page 151</strong>
<br><br>(See Commission Exhibit No. 1061, p. 148.)  Neither elevator was
there.333  Truly pushed the button for the west elevator which
operates automatically if the gate is closed.334  He shouted twice,
"Turn loose the elevator."335 When the elevator failed to come, Baker
said, "let's take the stairs," and he followed Truly up the stairway,
which is to the west of the elevator.336
<br><br>The stairway is located in the northwest corner of the Depository
Building.  The stairs from one floor to the next are "L-shaped," with
both legs of the "L" approximately the same length.  Because the
stairway itself is enclosed, neither Baker nor Truly could see
anything on the second-floor hallway until they reached the landing at
the top of the stairs.337  On the second-floor landing there is a
small open area with a door at the east end.  This door leads into a
small vestibule, and another door leads from the vestibule into the
second-floor lunchroom.338  (See Commission Exhibit No. 1118, p. 150.)  
The lunchroom door is usually open, but the first door is kept shut
by a closing mechanism on the door.339 This vestibule door is solid
except for a small glass window in the upper part of the door.340  As
Baker reached the second floor, he was about 20 feet from the
vestibule door.341  He intended to continue around to his left toward
the stairway going up but through the window in the door he caught a
fleeting glimpse of a man walking in the vestibule toward the
lunchroom.342
<br><br>Since the vestibule door is only a few feet from the lunchroom
door,343 the man must have entered the vestibule only a second or two
before Baker arrived at the top of the stairwell.  Yet he must have
entered the vestibule door before Truly reached the top of the
stairwell, since Truly did not see him.344  If the man had passed from
the vestibule into the lunchroom, Baker could not have seen him. Baker
said:
    <blockquote>He [Truly] had already started around the bend to come to the next
    elevator going up, I was coming out this one on the second floor, and
    I don't know, I was kind of sweeping this area as I come up, I was
    looking from right to left and as I got to this door here I caught a
    glimpse of this man, just, you know, a sudden glimpse ... and it
    looked to me like he was going away from me.<br>
    &deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;<br>
	I can't say whether he had gone on through that door [the
    lunchroom door] or not.  All I did was catch a glance at him, and
    evidently he was--this door might have been, you know, closing and
    almost shut at that time.345</blockquote>

With his revolver drawn, Baker opened the vestibule door and ran into
the vestibule.  He saw a man walking away from him in the lunchroom.
Baker stopped at the door of the lunchroom and commanded, "Come
here."346  The man turned and walked back toward Baker.347  He had
been proceeding toward the rear of the lunchroom.348  Along a side
wall of the lunchroom was a soft drink rending machine,349 but at that
time the man had nothing in his hands.350
<br><br><strong>Page 152</strong>
<br><br>Meanwhile, Truly had run up several steps toward the third
floor. Missing Baker, he came back to find the officer in the doorway
to the lunchroom facing Lee Harvey Oswald.351  Baker turned to Truly
and said, "Do you know this man, does he work here?"352  Truly
replied, "Yes."353	Baker stated later that the man did not seem to
be out of breath; he seemed calm.  "He never did say a word or
nothing. In fact, he didn't change his expression one bit." 352  Truly
said of Oswald: "He didn't seem to be excited or overly afraid or
anything. He might have been a bit startled, like I might have. been
if somebody confronted me.  But I cannot recall any change in
expression of any kind on his face." 355  Truly thought that the
officer's gun at that time appeared to be almost touching the middle
portion of Oswald's body.  Truly also noted at this time that Oswald's
hands were empty. 356
<br><br>In an effort to determine whether Oswald could have descended to
the lunchroom from the sixth floor by the time Baker and Truly
arrived, Commission counsel asked Baker and Truly to repeat their
movements from the time of the shot until Baker came upon Oswald in
the lunchroom. Baker placed himself on a motorcycle about 200 feet
from the corner of Elm and Houston Streets where he said he heard the
shots.357  Truly stood in front of the building. 358  At a given
signal, they reenacted the event.  Baker's movements were timed with a
stopwatch.  On the first test, the elapsed time between the simulated
first shot and Baker's arrival on the second-floor stair landing was 1
minute and 30 seconds.  The second test run required 1 minute and 15
seconds. 359
<br><br>A test was also conducted to determine the time required to walk
from the southeast corner of the sixth floor to the second-floor
lunchroom by stairway. Special Agent John Howlett of the Secret
Service carried a rifle from the southeast corner of the sixth floor
along the east aisle to the northeast corner. He placed the rifle on
the floor near the site where Oswald's rifle was actually found after
the shooting. Then Howlett walked down the stairway to the
second-floor landing and entered the lunchroom. The first test, run at
normal walking pace, required 1 minute, 18 seconds; 360 the second
test, at a "fast walk" took 1 minute, 14 seconds. 361 The second test.
followed immediately after the first. The only interval was the time
necessary to ride in the elevator from the second to the sixth floor
and walk back to the southeast corner. Howlett was not short winded at
the end of either test run. 362
<br><br>The minimum time required by Baker to park his motorcycle and
reach the second-floor lunchroom was within 3 seconds of the time
needed to walk from the southeast corner of the sixth floor down the
stairway to the lunchroom.  The time actually required for Baker and
Truly to reach the second floor on November 22 was probably longer
than in the test runs.  For example, Baker required 15 seconds after
the simulated shot to ride his motorcycle 180 to 200 feet, park it,
and run 45 feet to the building. 363  No allowance was made for the
special conditions which existed on the day of the
assassination--possible delayed reaction to the shot, jostling with
the crowd of people on 
<br><br><strong>Page 153</strong>
<br><br>the steps and scanning the area along Elm Street and the parkway.364
Baker said,  "We simulated the shots and by the time we got there, we
did everything that I did that day, and this would be the minimum,
because I am sure that I, you know, it took me a little longer." 365
On the basis of this time test, therefore, the Commission concluded
that Oswald could have fired the shots and still have been present in
the second-floor lunchroom when seen by Baker and Truly.
<br><br>That Oswald descended by stairway from the sixth floor to the
second-floor lunchroom is consistent with the movements of the two
elevators, which would have provided the other possible means of
descent. When Truly, accompanied by Baker, ran to the rear of the
first floor, he was certain that both elevators, which occupy the same
shaft, 366 were on the fifth floor. 367  Baker, not realizing that
there were two elevators, thought that only one elevator was in the
shaft and that it was two or three floors above the second floor. 368
In the few seconds which elapsed while Baker and Truly ran from the 
first to the second floor, neither of these slow elevators could have
descended from the fifth to the second floor.  Furthermore, no
elevator was at the second floor when they arrived there. 369  Truly
and Baker continued up the stairs after the encounter with Oswald in
the lunchroom.  There was no elevator on the third or fourth floor.
The east elevator was on the fifth floor when they arrived; the west
elevator was not.  They took the east elevator to the seventh floor
and ran up a stairway to the roof where they searched for several
minutes. 370
<br><br>Jack Dougherty, an employee working on the fifth floor, testified
that he took the west elevator to the first floor after hearing a
noise which sounded like a backfire. 370  Eddie Piper, the janitor,
told Dougherty that the President had been shot, 372 but in his
testimony Piper did not mention either seeing or talking with
Dougherty during these moments of excitement. 373  Both Dougherty and
Piper were confused witnesses. They had no exact memory of the events
of that afternoon.  Truly was probably correct in stating that the
west elevator was on the fifth floor when he looked up the elevator
shaft from the first floor. The west elevator was not on the fifth
floor when Baker and Truly reached that floor, probably because Jack
Dougherty took it to the first floor while Baker and Truly were
running up the stairs or in the lunchroom with Oswald. Neither
elevator could have been used by Oswald as a means of descent.
<br><br>Oswald's use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of
other employees in the building.  Three employees-- James Jarman, Jr.,
Harold Norman, and Bonnie Ray Williams--were watching the parade from
the fifth floor, directly below the window from which the shots were
fired.  They rushed to the west windows after the shots were fired and
remained there until after they saw Patrolman Baker's white helmet on
the fifth floor moving toward the elevator. 374 While they were at the
west windows their view of the stairwell was completely blocked by
shelves and boxes. 375  This is the period during which Oswald would
have descended the stairs.  In all likelihood Dougherty took the
elevator down from the fifth floor after Jarman, 
<br><br><strong>Page 154</strong>
<br><br>Norman, and Williams ran to the west windows and were deciding what to
do.  None of these three men saw Dougherty, probably because of the
anxiety of the moment and because of the books which may have blocked
the view. 376  Neither Jarman, Norman, Williams, or Dougherty saw
Oswald. 377
<br><br>Victoria Adams, who worked on the fourth floor of the Depository
Building, claimed that within about 1 minute following the shots she
ran from a window on the south side of the fourth floor, 378 down the
rear stairs to the first floor, where she encountered two Depository
employees--William Shelley and Billy Lovelady. 379  If her estimate of
time is correct, she reached the bottom of the stairs before Truly and
Baker started up, and she must have run down the stairs ahead of
Oswald and would probably have seen or heard him.  Actually she
noticed no one on the back stairs.  If she descended from the fourth
to the first floor as fast as she claimed in her testimony, she would
have seen Baker or Truly on the first floor or on the stairs, unless
they were already in the second-floor lunchroom talking to Oswald.
When she reached the first floor, she actually saw Shelley and
Lovelady slightly east of the east elevator.
<br><br>Shelley and Lovelady, however, have testified that they were
watching the parade from the top step of the building entrance when
Gloria Calverly, who works in the Depository Building, ran up and said
that the President had been shot. 380 Lovelady and Shelley moved out
into the street. 381  About this time Shelley saw Truly and Patrolman
Baker go into the building Shelley and Lovelady, at a fast walk or
trot, turned west into the railroad yards and then to the west side of
the Depository Building. They reentered the building by the rear door
several minutes after Baker and Truly rushed through the front
entrance? 382  On entering, Lovelady saw a girl on the first floor who
he believes was Victoria Adams. 384 If Miss Adams accurately recalled
meeting Shelley and Lovelady when she reached the bottom of the
stairs, then her estimate of the time when she descended from the
fourth floor is incorrect, and she actually came down the stairs
several minutes after Oswald and after Truly and Baker as well.
<br><br>Oswald's departure from building.--Within a minute after Baker
and Truly left Oswald in the lunchroom, Mrs. R. A. Reid, clerical
supervisor for the Texas School Book Depository, saw him walk through
the clerical office on the second floor toward the door leading to the
front stairway.  Mrs. Reid had watched the parade from the sidewalk in
front of the building with Truly and Mr. O. V. Campbell, vice
president of the Depository. 385  She testified that she heard three
shots which she thought came from the building. 386  She ran inside
and up the front stairs into the large open office reserved for
clerical employees.  As she approached her desk, she saw Oswald. 387
He was walking into the office from the back hallway, carrying a full
bottle of Coca-Cola in his hand, 388 presumably purchased after the
encounter with Baker and Truly.  As Oswald passed Mrs. Reid she said,
"Oh, the President has been shot, but maybe they didn't hit him." 389
Oswald mumbled something and walked by. 390   She paid 
<br><br><strong>Page 155</strong>
<br><br>no more attention to him.  The only exit from the office in the
direction Oswald was moving was through the door to the front
stairway. 391 (See Commission Exhibit 1118, p. 150.)  Mrs. Reid
testified that when she saw Oswald, he was wearing a T-shirt and no
jacket. 392 When he left home that morning, Marina Oswald, who was
still in bed, suggested that he wear a jacket. 393  A blue jacket,
later identified by Marina Oswald as her husband's, 394 was
subsequently found in the building, 395 apparently left behind by
Oswald.
<br><br>Mrs. Reid believes that she returned to her desk from the street
about 2 minutes after the shooting. 396  Reconstructing her movements,
Mrs. Reid ran the distance three times and was timed in 2 minutes by
stopwatch. 397  The reconstruction was the minimum time. 398
Accordingly, she probably met Oswald at about 12:32, approximately
30-45 seconds after Oswald's lunchroom encounter with Baker and Truly.
After leaving Mrs. Reid in the front office, Oswald could have gone
down the stairs and out the front door by 12:33 p.m.399--3 minutes
after the shooting.  At that time the building had not yet been sealed
off by the police.
<br><br>While it was difficult to determine exactly when the police
sealed off the building, the earliest estimates would still have
permitted Oswald to leave the building by 12:33.  One of the police
officers assigned to the corner of Elm and Houston Streets for the
Presidential motorcade, W. E. Barnett, testified that immediately
after the shots he went to the rear of the building to check the fire
escape.  He then returned to the corner of Elm and Houston where he
met a sergeant who instructed him to find out the name of the
building.  Barnett ran to the building, noted its name, and then
returned to the corner. 400 There he was met by a construction
worker--in all likelihood Howard Brennan, who was wearing his work
helmet. 401  This worker told Barnett that the shots had been fired
from a window in the Depository Building, where upon Barnett posted
himself at the front door to make certain that no one left the
building.  The sergeant did the same thing at the rear of the
building. 402  Barnett estimated that approximately 3 minutes elapsed
between the time he heard the last of the shots and the time he
started guarding the front door.  According to Barnett, "there were
people going in and out" during this period. 403
<br><br>Sgt. D. V. Harkness of the Dallas police said that to his
knowledge the building was not sealed off at 12:36 p.m. when he called
in on police radio that a witness (Amos Euins) had seen shots fired
from a window of the building. 404  At that time, Inspector Herbert V.
 Sawyer's car was parked in front of the building. 405  Harkness did
not know whether or not two officers with Sawyer were guarding the
doors. 406  At 12:34 p.m. Sawyer heard a call over the police radio
that the shots had come from the Depository Building. 407  He then
entered the building and took the front passenger elevator as far as
it would go--the fourth floor. 408 After inspecting this floor, Sawyer
returned to the street about 3 minutes after he entered the building.
409 After he returned to the street he directed Sergeant Harkness to
station two patrolmen at the front door and not let anyone in or out; 
<br><br><strong>Page 156</strong>
<br><br>he also directed that the back door be sealed off. 410  This was no
earlier than 12:37 p.m. 411 and may have been later.  Special Agent
Forrest V. Sorrels of the Secret Service, who had been in the
motorcade, testified that after driving to Parkland Hospital, he
returned to the Depository Building about 20 minutes after the
shooting, found no police officers at the rear door and was able to
enter through this door without identifying himself.412
<br><br>Although Oswald probably left the building at about 12:33 p.m.,
his absence was not noticed until at least. one-half hour later.
Truly, who had returned with Patrolman Baker from the roof, saw the
police questioning the warehouse employees. Approximately 15 men
worked in the warehouse 413 and Truly noticed that Oswald was not
among those being questioned. 414 Satisfying himself that Oswald was
missing, Truly obtained Oswald's address, phone number, and
description from his employment application card.  The address listed
was for the Paine home in Irving.  Truly gave this information to
Captain Fritz who was on the sixth floor at the time. 415  Truly
estimated that he gave this information to Fritz about 15 or 20
minutes after the shots,416 but it was probably no earlier than 1:22
p.m., the time when the rifle was found.   Fritz believed that he
learned of Oswald's absence after the rifle was found.417  The fact
that Truly found Fritz in the northwest corner of the floor, near the
point where the rifle was found, supports Fritz' recollection.
<a name="conclusion3"></a>
<p></p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
<br><br>Fingerprint and palmprint evidence establishes that Oswald handled
two of the four cartons next to the window and also handled a paper
bag which was found near the cartons. Oswald was seen in the vicinity
of the southeast corner of the sixth floor approximately 35 minutes
before the assassination and no one could be found who saw Oswald
anywhere else in the building until after the shooting. An eyewitness
to the shooting immediately provided a description of the man in the
window which was similar to Oswald's actual appearance.  This witness
identified Oswald in a lineup as the man most nearly resembling the
man he saw and later identified Oswald as the man he observed.
Oswald's known actions in the building immediately after the
assassination are consistent with his having been at the southeast
corner window of the sixth floor at 12:30 p.m. On the basis of these
findings the Commission has concluded that. Oswald, at the time of the
assassination, was present at the window from which the shots were
fired.

<strong>THE KILLING OF PATROLMAN J. D. TIPPIT</strong>
<br><br>After leaving the Depository Building at approximately 12:33
p.m., Lee Harvey Oswald proceeded to his roominghouse by bus and taxi.
He arrived at approximately 1 p.m. and left a few minutes later. At 
<br><br><strong>Page 157</strong>
<br><br>about 1:16 p.m., a Dallas police officer, J. D. Tippit, was shot less
than 1 mile from Oswald's roominghouse.  In deciding whether Oswald
killed Patrolman Tippit the Commission considered the following: (1)
positive identification of the killer by two eyewitnesses who saw the
shooting and seven eyewitnesses who heard the shots and saw the gunman
flee the scene with the revolver in his hand, (2) testimony of
firearms identification experts establishing the identity of the
murder weapon, (3) evidence establishing the ownership of the murder
weapon, (4) evidence establishing the ownership of a zipper jacket
found along the path of flight taken by the gunman from the scene of
the shooting to the place of arrest.
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="movements">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Oswald's Movements After Leaving Depository Building</strong>
<br><br><em>The bus ride</em>.--According to the reconstruction of time and events
which the Commission found most credible, Lee Harvey Oswald left the
building approximately 3 minutes after the assassination. He probably
walked east on Elm Street for seven blocks to the corner of Elm and
Murphy where he boarded a bus which was heading back in the direction
of the Depository Building, on its way to the Oak Cliff section of
Dallas.  (See Commission Exhibit 1119-A, p. 158.)
<br><br>When Oswald was apprehended, a bus transfer marked for the
Lakewood-Marsalis route was found in his shirt pocket. 476  The
transfer was dated "Fri. Nov. 22, '63" and was punched in two places
by the busdriver. On the basis of this punchmark, which was
distinctive to each Dallas driver, the transfer was conclusively
identified as having been issued by Cecil J. McWatters, a busdriver
for the Dallas Transit Co. 419  On the basis of the date and time on
the transfer, McWatters was able to testify that the transfer had been
issued by him on a trip which passed a check point at St. Paul and Elm
Streets at 12:36 p.m., November 22, 1963. 420
<br><br>McWatters was sure that he left the checkpoint on time and he
estimated that it took him 3 to 4 minutes to drive three blocks west
from the checkpoint to Field Street, which he reached at about 12:40
p.m. 421  McWatters' recollection is that he issued this transfer to a
man who entered his bus just beyond Field Street, where a man beat on
the front door of the bus, boarded it and paid his fare. 422  About
two blocks later, a woman asked to get off to make a 1 o'clock train
at Union Station and requested a transfer which she might use if she
got through the traffic.
    <blockquote>... So I gave her a transfer and opened the door and she was
    going out the gentleman I had picked up about two    blocks  [back]
    asked  for a transfer and got off at the same place in the middle of
    the block where the lady did.<br>
    ... It was the intersection near Lamar Street, it was near
    Poydras and Lamar Street. 423</blockquote>
<strong>Page 158</strong>
<br><br>This page reproduces COMMISSION EXHIBIT No. 1119-A: a diagram showing the Whereabouts of Lee Harvey
Oswald between 12:33 p.m. and 1:50 p.m., November 22, 1963.
<br><br><strong>Page 159</strong>
<br><br>The man was on the bus approximately 4 minutes.424
<br><br>At about 6:30 p.m. on the day of the assassination, McWatters
viewed four men in a police lineup.  He picked Oswald from the lineup
as the man who had boarded the bus at the "lower end of town on Elm
around Houston," and who, during the ride south on Marsalis, had an
argument with a woman passenger.425  In his Commission testimony,
McWatters said he had been in error and that a teenager named Milton
Jones was the passenger he had in mind.425 In a later interview, Jones
confirmed that he had exchanged words with a woman passenger on the
bus during the ride south on Marsalis.427  McWatters also remembered
that a man received a transfer at Lamar and Elm Streets and that a man
in the lineup was about the size of this man.428  However, McWatters'
recollection alone was too vague to be a basis for placing Oswald on
the bus.
<br><br>Riding on the bus was an elderly woman, Mary Bledsoe, who
confirmed the mute evidence of the transfer.  Oswald had rented a room
from Mrs. Bledsoe about 6 weeks before, on October 7,429 but she had
asked him to leave at the end of a week.  Mrs. Bledsoe told him "I am
not going to rent to you any more." 430  She testified, "I didn't like
his attitude.... There was just something about him I didn't like
or want him.... Just didn't want him around me." 481  On November
22, Mrs. Bledsoe came downtown to watch the Presidential motorcade.
She boarded the Marsalis bus at St. Paul and Elm Streets to return
home.432  She testified further: 
    <blockquote>And, after we got past Akard, at Murphy--I figured it out.
    Let's see.  I don't know for sure.  Oswald got on.  He looks like   a
    maniac. His sleeve was out here. ... His shirt was undone.<br>
    &deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;<br>
    Was a hole in it, hole, and he was dirty, and I didn't look at him.  I didn't want to know I even seen him ...<br>
    &deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;<br>
    ... he looked so bad in his face, and his face was so distorted.<br>
    &deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;<br>
    ... Hole in his sleeve right here.433</blockquote>

As Mrs. Bledsoe said these words, she pointed to her fight
elbow.434 When Oswald was arrested in the Texas Theatre, he was
wearing a brown sport shirt with a hole in the right sleeve at the
elbow.435  Mrs. Bledsoe identified the shirt as the one Oswald was
wearing and she stated she was certain that it was Oswald who boarded
the bus.436  Mrs. Bledsoe recalled that Oswald sat halfway to the rear
of the bus which moved slowly and intermittently as traffic became
heavy.437  She heard a passing motorist tell the driver that the
President 
<br><br><strong>Page 160</strong>
<br><br>had been shot.438  People on the bus began talking about it.  As the
bus neared Lamar Street, Oswald left the bus and disappeared into the
crowd.439
<br><br>The Marsalis bus which Oswald boarded traveled a route west on
Elm, south on Houston, and southwest across the Houston viaduct to
service the Oak Cliff area along Marsalis.440  A Beckley bus which
also served the Oak Cliff area, followed the same route as the
Marsalis bus through downtown Dallas, except that it continued west on
Elm, across Houston in front of the Depository Building, past the
Triple Underpass into west Dallas, and south on Beckley.441 Marsalis
Street is seven blocks from Beckley.442  Oswald lived at 1026 North
Beckley.443  He could not reach his roominghouse on the Marsalis bus,
but the Beckley bus stopped across the street.444  According to
McWatters, the Beckley bus was behind the Marsalis bus, but he did not
actually see it.445 Both buses stopped within one block of the
Depository Building.  Instead of waiting there, Oswald apparently went
as far away as he could and boarded the first Oak Cliff bus which came
along rather than wait for one which stopped across the street from
his roominghouse.
<br><br>In a reconstruction of this bus trip, agents of the Secret Service and
the FBI walked the seven blocks from the front entrance of the
Depository Building to Murphy and Elm three times, averaging 6.5
minutes for the three trips.446  A bus moving through heavy traffic on
Elm from Murphy to Lamar was timed at 4 minutes.447  If Oswald left
the Depository Building at 12:33 p.m., walked seven blocks directly to
Murphy and Elm, and boarded a bus almost immediately, he would have
boarded the bus at approximately 12:40 p.m. and left it at
approximately 12:44 p.m.  (See Commission Exhibit No.1119-A, p. 158.)
<br><br>Roger D. Craig, a deputy sheriff of Dallas County, claimed that
about 15 minutes after the assassination he saw a man, whom he later
identified as Oswald,448 coming from the direction of the Depository
Building and running down the hill north of Elm Street toward a
light-colored Rambler station wagon, which was moving slowly along Elm
toward the underpass:449 The station wagon stopped to pick up the man
and then drove off.450  Craig testified that later in the afternoon
he saw Oswald in the police interrogation room and told Captain Fritz
that Oswald was the man he saw.451  Craig also claimed that when Fritz
pointed out to Oswald that Craig had identified him, Oswald rose from
his chair, looked directly at Fritz, and said, "Everybody will know
who I am now." 452
<br><br>The Commission could not accept important elements of Craig's
testimony.  Captain Fritz stated that a deputy sheriff whom he could
not identify did ask to see him that afternoon and told him a similar
story to Craig's.453  Fritz did not bring him into his office to
identify Oswald but turned him over to Lieutenant Baker for
questioning.  If Craig saw Oswald that afternoon, he saw him through
the glass windows of the office.  And neither Captain Fritz nor any
other officer can remember that Oswald dramatically arose from his
chair and said, 
<br><br><strong>Page 161</strong>
<br><br>"Everybody will know who I am now." 454  If Oswald had made such a
statement, Captain Fritz and others present would probably have
remembered it.  Craig may have seen a person enter a white Rambler
station wagon 15 or 20 minutes after the shooting and travel west on
Elm Street, but the Commission concluded that this man was not Lee
Harvey Oswald, because of the overwhelming evidence that Oswald was
far away from the building by that time.
<br><br><em>The taxicab ride</em>.--William Whaley, a taxicab driver, told his
employer on Saturday morning, November 23, that he recognized Oswald
from a newspaper photograph as a man whom he had driven to the Oak
Cliff area the day before.455 Notified of Whaley's statement, the
police brought him to the police station that afternoon. He was taken
to the lineup room where, according to Whaley, five young teenagers,
all handcuffed together, were displayed with Oswald.456  He testified
that Oswald looked older than the other boys.457 The police asked him
whether he could pick out his passenger from the lineup.  Whaley
picked Oswald.  He said,
    <blockquote>... you could have picked him out without identifying him by
    just listening to him because he was bawling out the policeman,
    telling them it wasn't right to put him in line with these teenagers
    and all of that and they asked me which one and I told them. It was
    him all right, the same man.
    &deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;<br>
    He showed no respect for the policemen, he told them what he
    thought about them.  They knew what they were doing and they were
    trying to railroad him and he wanted his lawyer.458</blockquote>

Whaley believes that Oswald's conduct did not aid him in his
identification "because I knew he was the right one as soon as I saw
him." 459
<br><br>Whaley's memory of the lineup is inaccurate.  There were four
men altogether, not six men, in the lineup with Oswald.460  Whaley
said that Oswald was the man under No. 2.461  Actually Oswald was
under No. 3.  Only two of the men in the lineup with Oswald were
teenagers: John T. Horn, aged 18, was No. 1; David Knapp, aged 18, was
No. 2; Lee Oswald was No. 3; and Daniel Lujan, aged 26, was No. 4. 462
<br><br>When he first testified before the Commission, Whaley displayed a
trip manifest 463 which showed a 12 o'clock trip from Travis Hotel to
the Continental bus station, unloaded at 12:15 p.m., a 12:15 p.m.
pickup at Continental to Greyhound, unloaded at 12:30 p.m., and a
pickup from Greyhound (bus station) at 12:30 p.m., unloaded at 500
North Beckley at 12:45 p.m. Whaley testified that he did not keep an
accurate time record of his trips but recorded them by the quarter
hour, and that sometimes he made his entry right after a trip while at
other times he waited to record three or four trips.464  As he
unloaded his Continental bus station passenger in front of Greyhound, 
<br><br><strong>Page 162</strong>
<br><br>he started to get out to buy a package of cigarettes.465 He saw a man
walking south on Lamar from Commerce.  The man was dressed in faded
blue color khaki work clothes, a brown shirt, and some kind of work
jacket that almost matched his pants.466 The man asked, "May I have
the cab?", and got into the front seat.467	Whaley described the
ensuing events as follows:
    <blockquote>And about that time an old lady, I think she was an old lady, I don't
    remember nothing but her sticking her head down past him in the door
    and said, "Driver, will you call me a cab down here?"<br>
    She had seen him get this cab and she wanted one, too, and he
    opened the door a little bit like he was going to get out and he said,
    "I will let you have this one," and she says, "No, the driver can call
    me one."<br>
    &deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;<br>
    	... I asked him where he wanted to go.  And he said, "500 North
    Beckley."<br>
    Well, I started up, I started to that address, and the police
    cars, the sirens was going, running crisscrossing everywhere, just a
    big uproar in that end of town and I said, "What the hell.  I wonder
    what the hell is the uproar?"<br>
    And he never said anything.  So I figured he was one of these
    people that don't like to talk so I never said any more to him.
    But when I got pretty close to 500 block at Neches and North
    Beckley which is the 500 block, he said, "This will do fine," and I
    pulled over to the curb right. there.  He gave me a dollar bill, the
    trip was 95 cents. He gave me a dollar bill and didn't say anything,
    just got out and closed the door and walked around the front of the
    cab over to the other side of the street [east side of the street].
    Of course, the traffic was moving through there and I put it in gear
    and moved on, that is the last I saw of him.468</blockquote>

Whaley was somewhat imprecise as to where he unloaded his passenger.
He marked what, he thought was the intersection of Neches and Beckley
on a map of Dallas with a large "X." 469 He said, "Yes, sir; that is
right, because that is the 500 block of North Beckley."  However,
Neches and Beckley do not intersect. Neches is within one-half block
of the roominghouse at 1026 North Beckley where Oswald was living.
The 500 block of North Beckley is five blocks south of the
roominghouse.471
<br><br>After a review of these inconsistencies in his testimony before
the Commission, Whaley was interviewed again in Dallas.  The route of
the taxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.472  He
directed the driver of the car to a point 20 feet north of the
northwest corner of the intersection of Beckley and Neely, the point
at. which he said his passenger alighted.473  This was the 700 block
of North  
<br><br><strong>Page 163</strong>  
<br><br>Beckley.474  The elapsed time of the reconstructed run from the
Greyhound Bus Station to Neely and Beckley was 5 minutes and 30
seconds by stopwatch.475  The walk from Beckley and Neely to 1026
North Beckley was timed by Commission counsel at 5 minutes and 45
seconds.476
<br><br>Whaley testified that Oswald was wearing either the gray zippered
jacket or the heavy blue jacket.477 He was in error, however.  Oswald
could not possibly have been wearing the blue jacket during the trip
with Whaley, since it was found in the "domino" room of the Depository
late in November. 478  Moreover, Mrs. Bledsoe saw Oswald in the bus
without a jacket and wearing a shirt with a hole at the elbow.479 On
the other hand, Whaley identified Commission Exhibit No. 150 (the
shirt taken from Oswald upon arrest) as the shirt his passenger was
wearing.480 He also stated he saw a silver identification bracelet on
his passenger's left wrist.481  Oswald was wearing such a bracelet
when he was arrested.482  On November 22, Oswald told Captain Fritz
that he rode a bus to a stop near his home and then walked to his
roominghouse.483 When queried the following morning concerning a bus
transfer found in his possession at the time of his arrest, he
admitted receiving it.484 And when interrogated about a cab ride,
Oswald also admitted that he left the slow-moving bus and took a cab
to his roominghouse.485
<br><br>The Greyhound Bus Station at Lamar and Jackson Streets, where
Oswald entered Whaley's cab, is three to four short blocks south of
Lamar and Elm.486  If Oswald left the bus at 12:44 p.m. and walked
directly to the terminal, he would have entered the cab at 12:47 or
12:48 p.m.  If the cab ride was approximately 6 minutes, as was the
reconstructed ride, he would have reached his destination at
approximately 12:54 p.m.  If he was discharged at Neely and Beckley
and walked directly to his roominghouse, he would have arrived there
about 12:59 to 1 p.m.  From the 500 block of North Beckley, the walk
would be a few minutes longer, but in either event he would have been
in the roominghouse at about 1 p.m.  This is the approximate time he
entered the roominghouse, according to Earlene Roberts, the
housekeeper there.487  (See Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158.)
<br><br><em>Arrival and departure from roominghouse</em>.---Earlene Roberts,
housekeeper for Mrs. A. C. Johnson at 1026 North Beckley, knew Lee
Harvey Oswald under the alias of O. II. Lee.  She first saw him the
day he rented a room at that address on October 14, 1963.488 signed
his name as O.H. Lee on the roominghouse register.489
<br><br>Mrs. Roberts testified that on Thursday, November 21, Oswald
did not come home.  On Friday, November 22, about 1 p.m., he entered
the house in unusual haste.  She recalled that it was subsequent to
the time the President had been shot.  After a friend had called and
told her, "President Kennedy has been shot," she turned on the
television. When Oswald came in she said, "Oh, you are in a hurry,"
but Oswald did not respond.  He hurried to his room and stayed no
longer than 3 or 4 minutes.  Oswald had entered the house in his shirt
sleeves,

<br><br><strong>Page 165</strong>
<br><br>but when he left, he was zipping up a jacket.  Mrs. Roberts saw him a
few seconds later standing near the bus stop in front of the house on
the east side of Beckley.490
<br><br>Oswald was next seen about nine-tenths of a mile away at the
southeast corner of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, moments before the
Tippit shooting.  (See Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158.) If
Oswald left. his roominghouse shortly after 1 p.m. and walked at a
brisk pace, he would have reached 10th and Patton shortly after 1:15
p.m.491  Tippit's murder was recorded on the police radio tape at
about 1:16 p.m.492
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="description">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Description of Shooting</strong>
<br><br>Patrolman J. D. Tippit joined the Dallas Police Department in July
1952.493  He was described by Chief Curry as having the reputation of
being "a very fine, dedicated officer." 494  Tippit patroled district
No. 78 in the Oak Cliff area of Dallas during daylight hours. He drove a police car 
painted distinctive colors with No. 10 prominently displayed on each side.  
Tippit rode alone, as only one man was normally assigned to a patrol car in residential areas 
during daylight shifts.495
<br><br>At about 12:44 p.m. on November 22, the radio dispatcher on
channel 1 ordered all downtown patrol squads to report to Elm and
Houston, code 3 (emergency).496  At 12:45 p.m. the dispatcher ordered
No. 78 (Tippit) to "move into central Oak Cliff area."497 At 12:54
p.m., Tippit reported that he was in the central Oak Cliff area at
Lancaster and Eighth.  The dispatcher ordered Tippit to be:  "... at
large for any emergency that comes in." 498  According to Chief Curry,
Tippit was free to patrol the central Oak Cliff area.499 Tippit must
have heard the description of the suspect wanted for the President's
shooting; it was broadcast over channel 1 at 12:45 p.m., again at
12:48 p.m., and again at 12:55 p.m.500  The suspect was described as a
"white male, approximately 30, slender build, height 5 foot 10 inches,
weight 165 pounds." 501  A similar description was given on channel 2
at 12:45 p.m.502
<br><br>At approximately 1:15 p.m., Tippit, who was cruising east on
10th Street, passed the intersection of 10th and Patton, about eight
blocks from where he had reported at 12:54 p.m.  About 100 feet past
the intersection Tippit stopped a man walking east along the south
side of Patton.  (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, p. 164.) The man's
general description was similar to the one broadcast over the police
radio.  Tippit stopped the man and called him to his car. He
approached the car and apparently exchanged words with Tippit through
the right front or vent window.  Tippit got out and started to walk
around the front of the car As Tippit reached the left front wheel the
man pulled out a revolver and fired several shots. Four bullets hit
Tippit and killed him instantly.  The gunman started back toward
Patton Avenue, ejecting the empty cartridge cases before reloading
with fresh bullets.
<br><br><strong>Page 166</strong>
<a name="eyewitnesses"></a>
<p></p>
<strong>Eyewitnesses</strong>
<br><br>At least 12 persons saw the man with the revolver in the
vicinity of the Tippit crime scene at or immediately after the
shooting.  By the evening of November 22, five of them had identified
Lee Harvey Oswald in police lineups as the man they saw.  A sixth did
so the next day.  Three others subsequently identified Oswald from a
photograph.  Two witnesses testified that Oswald resembled the man
they had seen.  One witness felt he was too distant from the gunman to
make a positive identification. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, p.
164.)
<br><br>A taxi driver, William Scoggins, was eating lunch in his cab
which was parked on Patton facing the southeast corner of 10th Street
and Patton Avenue a few feet to the north. 503 A police car moving
east on 10th at about 10 or 12 miles an hour passed in front of his
cab.  About 100 feet from the comer the police car pulled up alongside
a man on the sidewalk.  This man, dressed in a light-colored jacket,
approached the car.  Scoggins lost sight of him behind some shrubbery
on the southeast corner lot, but he saw the policeman leave the car,
heard three or four shots, and then saw the policeman fall. Scoggins
hurriedly left his seat and hid behind the cab as the man came back
toward the corner with gun in hand. The man cut across the yard
through some bushes, passed within 12 feet of Scoggins, and ran south
on Patton. Scoggins saw him and heard him mutter either "Poor damn
cop" or "Poor dumb cop." 504  The next day Scoggins viewed a lineup of
four persons and identified Oswald as the man whom he had seen the day
before at 10th and Patton.505  In his testimony before the Commission,
Scoggins stated that he thought he had seen a picture of Oswald in the
newspapers prior to the lineup identification on Saturday.  He had not
seen Oswald on television and had not been shown any photographs of
Oswald by the police.506
<br><br>Another witness, Domingo Benavides, was driving a pickup truck
west on 10th Street.  As he crossed the intersection a block east of
10th and Patton, he saw a policeman standing by the left door of the
police car parked along the south side of 10th.  Benavides saw a man
standing at the right side of the parked police car. He then heard
three shots and saw the policeman fall to the ground. By this time the
pickup truck was across the street and about 25 feet from the police
car.  Benavides stopped and waited in the truck until the gunman ran
to the corner.  He saw him empty the gun and throw the shells into
some bushes on the southeast corner lot.507  It was Benavides, using
Tippit's car radio, who first reported the killing of Patrolman Tippit
at about 1:16 p.m.: "We've had a shooting out here." 508  He found two
empty shells in the bushes and gave them to Patrolman J. M. Poe who
arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting.509  Benavides never
saw Oswald after the arrest.  When questioned by police officers on
the evening of November 22, Benavides told them that he did not think
that he could identify the man who fired the shots.  As a result, they
did not take him to the police station. 
<br><br><strong>Page 167</strong>
<br><br>He testified that the picture of Oswald which he saw later on
television bore a resemblance to the man who shot Officer Tippit. 510
<br><br>Just prior to the shooting, Mrs. Helen Markham, a waitress in
downtown Dallas, was about to cross 10th Street at Patton. As she
waited on the northwest corner of the intersection for traffic to
pass,511 she noticed a young man as be was "almost ready to get up on
the curb" 512 at the southeast corner of the intersection,
approximately 50 feet away.  The man continued along 10th Street.
Mrs. Markham saw a police car slowly approach the man from the rear
and stop alongside of him.  She saw the man come to the right window
of the police car. As he talked, he leaned on the ledge of the right
window with his arms.  The man appeared to step back as the policeman
"calmly opened the car door" and very slowly got out and walked toward
the front of the car.  The man pulled a gun.  Mrs. Markham heard three
shots and saw the policeman fall to the ground near the left front
wheel.  She raised her hands to her eyes as the man started to walk
back toward Patton.513  She peered through her fingers, lowered her
hands, and saw the man doing something with his gun. "He was just
fooling with it.  I didn't know what he was doing. I was afraid he was
fixing to kill me." 514  The man "in kind of a little trot" headed
down Patton toward Jefferson Boulevard, a block away.  Mrs. Markham
then ran to Officer Tippit's side and saw him lying in a pool of
blood. 515
<br><br>Helen Markham was screaming as she leaned over the body.516  A
few minutes later she described the gunman to a policeman. 517  Her
description and that of other eyewitnesses led to the police broadcast
at 1:22 p.m. describing the slayer as "about 30, 5'8", black hair,
slender." 518  At about 4:30 p.m., Mrs. Markham, who had been greatly
upset by her experience, was able to view a lineup of four men
handcuffed together at the police station. 519  She identified Lee
Harvey Oswald as the man who shot the policeman.520  Detective L. C.
Graves, who had been with Mrs. Markham before the lineup testified
that she was "quite hysterical" and was "crying and upset." 521  He
said that Mrs. Markham started crying when Oswald walked into the
lineup room. 522  In testimony before the Commission, Mrs. Markham
confirmed her positive identification of Lee Harvey Oswald as the man
she saw kill Officer Tippit. 523
<br><br>In evaluating Mrs. Markham's identification of Oswald, the
Commission considered certain allegations that Mrs. Markham described
the man who killed Patrolman Tippit as "short, a little on the heavy
side," and having "somewhat bushy" hair.523 The Commission reviewed
the transcript of a phone conversation in which Mrs. Markham is
alleged to have provided such a description.525  A review of the
complete transcript has satisfied the Commission that Mrs. Markham
strongly reaffirmed her positive identification of Oswald and denied
having described the killer as short, stocky and having bushy hair.
She stated that the man weighed about 150 pounds.526	Although she
used the words "a little bit bushy" to describe the gunman's hair, the
transcript establishes that she was referring to the uncombed 
<br><br><strong>Page 168</strong>
<br><br>state of his hair, a description fully supported by a photograph of
Oswald taken at the time of his arrest.  (See Pizzo Exhibit No. 453-C,
p. 177.)  Although in the phone conversation she described the man as
"short," 527 on November 22, within minutes of the shooting and before
the lineup, Mrs. Markham described the man to the police as 5'8" tall.
528
<br><br>During her testimony Mrs. Markham initially denied that she
ever had the above phone conversation.529  She has subsequently
admitted the existence of the conversation and offered an explanation
for her denial.530  Addressing itself solely to the probative value of
Mrs. Markham's contemporaneous description of the gunman and her
positive identification of Oswald at a police lineup, the Commission
considers her testimony reliable.  However, even in the absence of
Mrs. Markham's testimony, there is ample evidence to identify Oswald
as the killer of Tippit.
<br><br>Two young women, Barbara Jeanette Davis and Virginia Davis,
were in an apartment of a multiple-unit house on the southeast corner
of 10th and Patton when they heard the sound of gunfire and the
screams of Helen Markham.  They ran to the door in time to see a man
with a revolver cut across their lawn and disappear around a corner of
the house onto Patton.531 Barbara Jeanette Davis assumed that he was
emptying his gun as "he had it open and was shaking it." 532  She
immediately called the police.  Later in the day each woman found an
empty shell on the ground near the house.  These two shells were
delivered to the police.533
<br><br>On the evening of November 22, Barbara Jeanette and Virginia Davis
viewed a group of four men in a lineup and each one picked Oswald as
the man who crossed their lawn while emptying his pistol.534 Barbara
Jeanette Davis testified that no one had shown her a picture of Oswald
before the identification and that she had not seen him on television.
 She was not sure whether she had seen his picture in a newspaper on
the afternoon or evening of November 22 prior to the lineup.535  Her
reaction when she saw Oswald in the lineup was that "I was pretty sure
it was the same man I saw. When they made him turn sideways, I was
positive that was the one I seen." 536 Similarly, Virginia Davis had
not been shown pictures of anyone prior to the lineup and had not seen
either television or the newspapers during the afternoon.537 She
identified Oswald, who was the No. 2 man in the lineup,538 as the man
she saw running with the gun: she testified, "I would say that was him
for sure." 539  Barbara Jeanette Davis and Virginia Davis were sitting
alongside each other when they made their positive identifications of
Oswald.540  Each woman whispered Oswald's number to the detective.
Each testified that she was the first to make the identification.541
<br><br>William Arthur Smith was about a block east of 10th and Patton
when he heard shots. He looked west on 10th and saw a man running to
the west and a policeman falling to the ground. Smith failed to make
himself known to the police on November 22.   Several days later he
reported what he had seen and was questioned by FBI 
<br><br><strong>Page 169</strong>
<br><br>agents.542  Smith subsequently told a Commission staff member that he
saw Oswald on television the night of the murder and thought that
Oswald was the man he had seen running away from the shooting.543  On
television Oswald's hair looked blond, whereas Smith remembered that
the man who ran away had hair that was brown or brownish black.
Later, the FBI showed Smith a picture of Oswald.  In the picture the
hair was brown.544 According to his testimony, Smith told the FBI, "It
looked more like him than it did on television."  He stated further
that from "What I saw of him" the man looked like the man in the
picture.545
<br><br>Two other important eyewitnesses to Oswald's flight were Ted
Callaway, manager of a used-car lot on the northeast corner of Patton
Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard, and Sam Guinyard,  a porter at the
lot.  They heard the sound of shots to the north of their lot.546
Callaway heard five shots, and Guinyard three.  Both ran to the
sidewalk on the east side of Patton at a point about a half a block
south of 10th.  They saw a man coming south on Patton with a revolver
held high in his right hand.  According to Callaway, the man crossed
to the west side of Patton.547 From across the street Callaway yelled,
"Hey, man, what the hell is going on?"  He slowed down, halted, said
something, and then kept on going to the corner, turned right, and
continued west on Jefferson.548  Guinyard claimed that the man ran
down the east side of Patton and passed within 10 feet of him before
crossing to the other side.549  Guinyard and Callaway ran to 10th and
Patton and found Tippit lying in the street beside his car.550
Apparently he had reached for his gun; it lay beneath him outside of
the holster.  Callaway picked up the gun.551  He and Scoggins
attempted to chase down the gunman in Scoggin's taxicab,552 but he had
disappeared. Early in the evening of November 22, Guinyard and
Callaway viewed the same lineup of four men from which Mrs. Markham
had earlier made her identification of Lee Harvey Oswald.  Both men
picked Oswald as the man who had run south on Patton with a gun in his
hand.553  Callaway told the Commission: "So they brought four men in.
I stepped to the back of the room, so I could kind of see him from
the same distance which I had seen him before. And when he came out I
knew him." 554 Guinyard said, "I told them that was him right there. I
pointed him out right there." 555  Both Callaway and Guinyard
testified that they had not been shown any pictures by the police
before the lineup.556
<br><br>The Dallas Police Department furnished the Commission with
pictures of the men who appeared in the lineups with Oswald,557 and
the Commission has inquired into general lineup procedures used by the
Dallas police as well as the specific procedures in the lineups
involving Oswald.558  The Commission is satisfied that the lineups
were conducted fairly.
<br><br>As Oswald ran south on Patton Avenue toward Jefferson Boulevard he
was moving in the direction of a used-car lot located on the southeast
corner of this intersection.559  Four men--Warren Reynolds,560  
<br><br><strong>Page 170</strong>
This page reproduces COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 143: Revolver Used in Tippit Killing
<br><br><strong>Page 171</strong>
<br><br>Harold Russell 561 Pat Patterson 562 and L. J. Lewis 563--were on the
lot at the time, and they saw a white male with a revolver in his
hands running south on Patton. When the man reached Jefferson, he
turned right and headed west.  Reynolds and Patterson decided to
follow him. When he reached a gasoline service station one block away
he turned north and walked toward a parking area in the rear of the
station. Neither Reynolds nor Patterson saw the man after he turned
off Jefferson at the service station. 56 These four witnesses were
interviewed by FBI agents 2 months after the shooting. Russell and
Patterson were shown a picture of Oswald and they stated that Oswald
was the man they saw on November 22, 1963.  Russell confirmed this
statement in a sworn affidavit for the Commission.565  Patterson, when
asked later to confirm his identification by affidavit said he did not
recall having been shown the photograph.  He was then shown two
photographs of Oswald and he advised that Oswald was "unquestionably"
the man he saw.566  Reynolds did not make a positive identification
when interviewed by the FBI, but he subsequently testified before a
Commission staff member and, when shown two photographs of  Oswald,
stated that they were photographs of the man he saw.567  L.J. Lewis
said in an interview that because of the distance from which he
observed the gunman he would hesitate to state whether the man was
identical with Oswald. 568
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="murder">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Murder Weapon</strong>
<br><br>
When Oswald was arrested, he had in his possession a Smith &amp;
Wesson 38 Special caliber revolver, serial number V510210.  (See
Commission Exhibit No. 143, p. 170).  Two of the arresting officers
placed their initials on the weapon and a third inscribed his name.
All three identified Exhibit No. 143 as the revolver taken from Oswald
when he was arrested.569  Four cartridge cases were found in the
shrubbery on the corner of 10th and Patton by three of the
eyewitnesses--Domingo Benavides, Barbara Jeanette Davis, and Virginia
Davis.570  It was the unanimous and unequivocal testimony of expert
witnesses before the Commission that these used cartridge cases were
fired from the revolver in Oswald's possession to the exclusion of all
other weapons.  (See app. X, p. 559.)
<br><br>Cortlandt Cunningham, of the Firearms Identification
Unit of the FBI Laboratory, testified that he compared the four empty
cartridge cases found near the scene of the shooting with a test
cartridge fired from the weapon in Oswald's possession when he was
arrested.  Cunningham declared that this weapon fired the four
cartridges to the exclusion of all other weapons.  Identification was
effected through breech face marks and firing pin marks.571  Robert A.
Frazier and Charles Killion, other FBI firearms experts, independently
examined the four cartridge cases and arrived at the same conclusion
as Cunningham. 572  At the request of the Commission, Joseph D. Nicol,
superintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Criminal Identification
Investigation, also examined the four cartridge cases found near the
site of the homicide and compared them with the test cartridge cases 
<br><br><strong>Page 172</strong>
<br><br>fired from the Smith &amp; Wesson revolver taken from Oswald.  He
concluded that all of these cartridges were fired from the same
weapon.573
<br><br>Cunningham compared four lead bullets recovered from the body of
Patrolman Tippit with test bullets fired from Oswald's revolver. 574 He
explained that the bullets were slightly smaller than the barrel of
the pistol which had fired them.  This caused the bullets to have an
erratic passage through the barrel and impressed upon the lead of the
bullets inconsistent individual characteristics which made
identification impossible.  Consecutive bullets fired from the
revolver by the FBI experts could not be identified as having been
fired from that revolver.575 (See app. X, p. 559.) Cunningham
testified that all of the bullets were mutilated, one being useless
for comparison purposes. All four bullets were fired from a weapon
with five lands and grooves and a right twist 576 which were the
rifling characteristics of the revolver taken from Oswald.  He
concluded, however, that he could not say whether the four bullets
were fired from the revolver in Oswald's possession.577  "The only
thing I can testify is they could have on the basis of the rifling
characteristics--they could have been." 578
<br><br>Nicol differed with the FBI experts on one bullet taken from
Tippit's body.  He declared that this bullet 579 was fired from the
same weapon that fired the test bullets to the exclusion of all other
weapons. But he agreed that because the other three bullets were
mutilated, he could not determine if they had been fired from the same
weapon as the test bullets.580
<br><br>The examination and testimony of the experts enabled the
Commission to conclude that five shots may have been fired, even
though only four bullets were recovered.  Three of the bullets
recovered from Tippit's body were manufactured by Winchester-Western,
and the fourth bullet by Remington-Peters, but only two of the four
discarded cartridge cases found on the lawn at 10th Street and Patton
Avenue were of Winchester-Western manufacture.581  Therefore, one
cartridge case of this type was not recovered.  And though only one
bullet of Remington-Peters manufacture was recovered, two empty
cartridge cases of that make were retrieved.  Therefore, either one
bullet of Remington-Peters manufacture is missing or one used
Remington-Peters cartridge case, which may have been in the revolver
before the shooting, was discarded along with the others as Oswald
left the scene.  If a bullet is missing, five were fired.  This
corresponds with the observation and memory of Ted Callaway,582 and
possibly Warren Reynolds, but not with the other eyewitnesses who
claim to have heard from two to four shots.

<br><br>By checking certain importers and dealers after the assassination
of President Kennedy and slaying of Officer Tippit, agents of the FBI
determined that George Rose &amp; Co. of Los Angeles was a major
distributor

<br><br><strong>Page 174</strong>
<br><br>of this type of revolver.583  Records of Seaport Traders, Inc., a
mail-order division of George Rose &amp; Co., disclosed that on January 3,
1963, the company received from Empire Wholesale Sporting Goods, Ltd.,
Montreal, a shipment of 99 guns in one case. Among these guns was a
.38 Special caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver, serial No. V510210, the
only revolver made by Smith &amp; Wesson with this serial number.584  When
first manufactured, it had a 5-inch barrel. George Rose &amp; Co. had the
barrel shortened by a gunsmith to 2 1/4 inches.585
<br><br>Sometime after January 27, 1963, Seaport Traders, Inc.,
received through the mail a mail-order coupon for one ".38 St. W. 2"
Bbl.," cost $29.95.  Ten dollars in cash was enclosed.  The order was
signed in ink by "A. J. Hidell, aged 28." 588  (See Commission Exhibit
No. 790, p. 173.)  The date of the order was January 27 (no year
shown), and the return address was Post Office Box 2915, Dallas, Tex.
Also on the order form was an order, written in ink, for one box of
ammunition and one holster, but a line was drawn through these items.
The mail-order form had a line for the name of a witness to attest
that the person ordering the gun was a U.S. citizen and had not been
convicted of a felony.  The name written in this space was D. F.
Drittal.587
<br><br>Heinz W. Michaelis, office manager of both George Rose &amp; Co.,
Inc., and Seaport Traders, Inc., identified records of Seaport
Traders, Inc., which showed that a ".38 S and W Special two-inch
Commando, serial number V510210" was shipped on March 20, 1963, to A.
J. Hidell, Post Office Box 2915, Dallas, Tex.  The invoice was
prepared on March 13, 1963; the revolver was actually shipped on March
20 by Railway Express.  The balance due on the purchase was $19.95.
Michaelis furnished the shipping copy of the invoice, and the Railway
Express Agency shipping documents, showing that $19.95, plus $1.27
shipping charge, had been collected from the consignee, Hidell.588
(See Michaelis Exhibits Nos. 2, 4, 5, p. 173.)
<br><br>Handwriting experts, Alwyn Cole of the Treasury Department and
James C. Cadigan of the FBI, testified before the Commission that the
writing on the coupon was Oswald's.  The signature of the witness, D.
F. Drittal, who attested that the fictitious Hidell was an American
citizen and had not been convicted of a felony, was also in Oswald's
handwriting.589  Marina Oswald gave as her opinion that the mail-order
coupon was in Oswald's handwriting. 590  When shown the revolver, she
stated that she recognized it as the one owned by her husband.591  She
also testified that this appeared to be the revolver seen in Oswald's
belt in the picture she took in late March or early April 1963 when
the family was living on Neely Street in Dallas. Police found an empty
revolver holster when they searched Oswald's room on Beckley Avenue
after his arrest.593 Marina Oswald testified that this was the holster
which contained the revolver in the photographs taken on Neely
Street.594
<br><br><strong>Page 175</strong>
<a name="jacket"></a>
<p></p>
<strong>Oswald's Jacket</strong>
<br><br>Approximately 15 minutes before the shooting of Tippit, Oswald was
seen leaving his roominghouse.595  He was wearing a zipper jacket
which he had not been wearing moments before when he had arrived
home.596  When Oswald was arrested, he did not have a jacket.597
Shortly after Tippit was slain, policemen found a light-colored zipper
jacket along the route taken by the killer as he attempted to
escape.598  (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, p. 164.)
<br><br>At 1:22 p.m. the Dallas police radio described the man wanted
for the murder of Tippit as "a white male about thirty, five foot
eight inches, black hair, slender, wearing a white jacket, white shirt
and dark slacks." 599  According to Patrolman Poe this description
came from Mrs. Markham and Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis.600 Mrs.
Markham told Poe that the man was a "white male, about 25, about five
feet eight, brown hair, medium," and wearing a "white jacket." Mrs.
Davis gave Poe the same general description: a "white male in his
early twenties, around five foot seven inches or eight inches, about
145 pounds," and wearing a white jacket.
<br><br>As has been discussed previously, two witnesses, Warren
Reynolds and B. M. Patterson, saw the gunman run toward the rear of a
gasoline service station on Jefferson Boulevard. Mrs. Mary Brock, the
wife of a mechanic who worked at the station, was there at the time
and she saw a white male, 5 feet, 10 inches ... wearing light
clothing ... a light-colored jacket" walk past her at a fast pace
with his hands in his pocket.  She last saw him in the parking lot
directly behind the service station.  When interviewed by FBI agents
on January 21, 1964, she identified a picture of Oswald as being the
same person she saw on November 22.  She confirmed this interview by a
sworn affidavit.601
<br><br>At 1:24 p.m., the police radio reported, "The suspect last seen
running west on Jefferson from 400 East Jefferson." 602 Police Capt.
W. R. Westbrook and several other officers concentrated their search
along Jefferson Boulevard.603  Westbrook walked through the parking
lot behind the service station 604 and found a light-colored jacket
lying under the rear of one of the cars.605  Westbrook identified
Commission Exhibit No. 162 as the light-colored jacket which he
discovered underneath the automobile.606
<br><br>This jacket belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald.  Marina Oswald stated
that her husband owned only two jackets, one blue and the other
gray.607  The blue jacket was found in the Texas School Book
Depository 608 and was identified by Marina Oswald as her
husband's.609  Marina Oswald also identified Commission Exhibit No.
162, the jacket found by Captain Westbrook, as her husband's second
jacket.610
<br><br>The eyewitnesses vary in their identification of the jacket.  Mrs.
Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper at Oswald's roominghouse and the last
person known to have seen him before he reached 10th Street and Patton
Avenue, said that she may have seen the gray zipper jacket but 
<br><br><strong>Page 176</strong>
<br><br>she was not certain. It seemed to her that the jacket Oswald wore was
darker than Commission Exhibit No. 162.611  Ted Callaway, who saw the
gunman moments after the shooting, testified that Commission Exhibit
No. 162 looked like the jacket he was wearing but "I thought it had a
little more tan to it." 612  Two other witnesses, Sam Guinyard and
William Arthur Smith, testified that Commission Exhibit No. 162 was
the jacket worn by the man they saw on November 22.  Mrs. Markham and
Barbara Davis thought that the jacket worn by the slayer of Tippit was
darker than the jacket found by Westbrook.613  Scoggins thought it was
lighter.614
<br><br>There is no doubt, however, that Oswald was seen leaving his
roominghouse at about 1 p.m. wearing a zipper jacket, that the man who
killed Tippit was wearing a light-colored jacket, that he was seen
running along Jefferson Boulevard, that a jacket was found under a car
in a lot adjoining Jefferson Boulevard, that the jacket belonged to
Lee Harvey Oswald, and that when he was arrested at approximately 1:50
p.m., he was in shirt sleeves.  These facts warrant the finding that
Lee Harvey Oswald disposed of his jacket as he fled from the scene of
the Tippit killing.
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="conclusion4">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>
<br><br>The foregoing evidence establishes that (1) two eyewitnesses
who heard the shots and saw the shooting of Dallas Police Patrolman J.
D. Tippit and seven eyewitnesses who saw the flight of the gunman with
revolver in hand positively identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man
they saw fire the shots or flee from the scene, (2) the cartridge
cases found near the scene of the shooting were fired from the
revolver in the possession of Oswald at the time of his arrest, to the
exclusion of all other weapons, (3) the revolver in Oswald's
possession at the time of his arrest was purchased by and belonged to
Oswald, and (4) Oswald's jacket was found along the path of flight
taken by the gunman as he fled from the scene of the killing.  On the
basis of this evidence the Commission concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald
killed Dallas Police Patrolman J. D. Tippit.

<strong>OSWALD'S ARREST</strong>
<br><br>The Texas Theatre is on the north side of Jefferson Boulevard,
approximately eight blocks from the scene of the Tippit shooting and
six blocks from where several witnesses last saw Oswald running west 
on Jefferson Boulevard.615  (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, p.
164.)  Shortly after the Tippit murder, police sirens sounded along
Jefferson Boulevard.  One of the persons who heard the sirens was
Johnny Calvin Brewer, manager of Hardy's Shoestore, a few doors east
of the Texas Theatre.  Brewer knew from radio broadcasts that the
President had been shot and that a patrolman had also been shot in Oak
Cliff.616  When he heard police sirens, he "looked up and 
<br><br><strong>Page 177</strong>
<br><br>This page reproduces HILL EXHIBIT B: Oswald in Front of Texas Theater; FRANK PIZZO EXHIBIT
 453-C and COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1797:  Oswald at Dallas Police Department
<br><br><strong>Page 178</strong>
<br><br>saw the man enter the lobby," a recessed area extending about 15 feet
between the sidewalk and the front door of his store.617  A police car
made a U-turn, and as the sirens grew fainter, the man in the lobby
"looked over his shoulder and turned around and walked up West
Jefferson towards the theatre." 618  The man wore a T-shirt beneath
his outer shirt and he had no jacket.619  Brewer said, "He just looked
funny to me. ... His hair was sort of messed up and looked like he
had been running, and he looked scared, and he looked funny." 620
<br><br>Mrs. Julia Postal, selling tickets at the box office of the
Texas Theatre, heard police sirens and then saw a man as he "ducked
into" the outer lobby space of the theatre near the ticket office. 620
 Attracted by the sound of the sirens, Mrs. Postal stepped out of the
box office and walked to the curb.622  Shortly thereafter, Johnny
Brewer, who had come from the nearby shoestore, asked Mrs. Postal
whether the fellow that had ducked in had bought a ticket.623  She
said, "No; by golly, he didn't," and turned around, but the man was
nowhere in sight.624  Brewer told Mrs. Postal that he had seen the man
ducking into his place of business and that he had followed him to the
theatre.625  She sent Brewer into the theatre to find the man and
check the exits, told him about the assassination, and said "I don't
know if this is the man they want. ... but he is running from them
for some reason." 626 She then called the police.627
<br><br>At 1:45 p.m., the police radio stated, "Have information a
suspect just went in the Texas Theatre on West Jefferson." 628 Patrol
cars bearing at least 15 officers converged on the Texas Theatre.629
Patrolman M. N. McDonald, with Patrolmen R. Hawkins, T. A. Hutson, and
C. T. Walker, entered the theatre from the rear.630 Other policemen
entered the front door and searched the balcony.631  Detective Paul L.
Bentley rushed to the balcony and told the projectionist to turn up
the house lights.632  Brewer met McDonald and the other policemen at
the alley exit door, stepped out onto the stage with them 633 and
pointed out the man who had come into the theatre without paying. 634
 The man was Oswald.  He was sitting alone in the rear of the main
floor of the theatre near the right center aisle.635 About six or
seven people were seated on the theatre's main floor and an equal
number in the balcony.636
<br><br>McDonald first searched two men in the center of the main
floor, about 10 rows from the front.637  He walked out of the row up
the right center aisle.638 When he reached the row where the suspect
was sitting, McDonald stopped abruptly and told the man to get on his
feet. 639   Oswald rose from his seat, bringing up both hands.640  As
McDonald started to search Oswald's waist for a gun, he heard him say,
"Well, it's all over now." 641  Oswald then struck McDonald between
the eyes with his left fist; with his right hand he drew a gun from
his waist.642  McDonald struck back with his right hand and grabbed
the gun with his left hand.643 They both fell into the seats.644 Three
other officers, moving toward the scuffle, grabbed Oswald from the
front, rear and side.645 As McDonald fell into the seat with his left 
<br><br><strong>Page 179</strong>
<br><br>hand on the gun, he felt something graze across his hand and heard
what sounded like the snap of the hammer.646  McDonald felt the pistol
scratch his cheek as he wrenched it away from Oswald.647  Detective
Bob K. Carroll, who was standing beside McDonald, seized the gum from
him.648
<br><br>The other officers who helped subdue Oswald corroborated McDonald
in his testimony except that they did not hear Oswald say, "It's all
over now."  Deputy Sheriff Eddy R. Walthers recalled such a remark but
he did not reach the scene of the struggle until Oswald had been
knocked to the floor by McDonald and the others.649  Some of the
officers saw Oswald strike McDonald with his fist.650 Most of them
heard a click which they assumed to be a click of the hammer of the
revolver.651  Testimony of a firearms expert before the Commission
established that the hammer of the revolver never touched the shell in
the chamber.652  Although the witnesses did not hear the sound of a
misfire, they might have heard a snapping noise resulting from the
police officer grabbing the cylinder of the revolver and pulling it
away from Oswald while he was attempting to pull the trigger.653  (See
app. X, p. 560.) 
<br><br>Two patrons of the theatre and John Brewer testified regarding
the arrest of Oswald, as did the various police officers who
participated in the fight.  George Jefferson Applin, Jr., confirmed
that Oswald fought with four or five officers before he was
handcuffed.654 He added that one officer grabbed the muzzle of a
shotgun, drew back, and hit Oswald with the butt end of the gun in the
back.655 No other theatre patron or officer has testified that Oswald
was hit by a gun. Nor did Oswald ever complain that he was hit with a
gun, or injured in the back. Deputy Sheriff Walthers brought a shotgun
into the theatre but laid it on some seats before helping subdue
Oswald.656 Officer Ray Hawkins said that there was no one near Oswald
who had a shotgun and he saw no one strike Oswald in the back with a
rifle butt or the butt of a gun.657
<br><br>John Gibson, another patron in the theatre, saw an officer grab
Oswald, and he claims that he heard the click of a gun misfiring.658
He saw no shotgun in the possession of any policeman near Oswald.659
Johnny Brewer testified he saw Oswald pull the revolver and the
officers struggle with him to take it away but that once he was
subdued, no officer struck him.660 He further stated that while fists
were flying he heard one of the officers say "Kill the President, will
you." 661  It is unlikely that any of the police officers referred to
Oswald as a suspect in the assassination. While the police radio had
noted the similarity in description of the two suspects, the arresting
officers were pursuing  Oswald for the murder of Tippit.662 As Oswald,
handcuffed, was led from the theatre, he was, according to McDonald,
"cursing a little bit and hollering police brutality." 663  At 1:51
p.m., police car 2 reported by radio that it was on the way to
headquarters with the suspect.664
<br><br>Captain Fritz returned to police headquarters from the Texas
School Book Depository at 2:15 after a brief stop at the sheriff's 
<br><br><strong>Page 180</strong>
<br><br>office.665  When he entered the homicide and robbery bureau office, he
saw two detectives standing there with Sgt. Gerald L. Hill, who had
driven from the theatre with Oswald.666  Hill testified that Fritz
told the detective to get a search warrant, go to an address on Fifth
Street in Irving, and pick up a man named Lee Oswald.  When Hill asked
why Oswald was wanted, Fritz replied, "Well, he was employed down at
the Book Depository and he had not been present for a roll call of the
employees." 667  Hill said, "Captain, we will save you a trip ...
there he sits." 668
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="statements">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>STATEMENTS OF OSWALD DURING DETENTION</strong>
<br><br>Oswald was questioned intermittently for approximately 12 hours
between 2:30 p.m., on November 22, and 11 a.m., on November 24.
Throughout this interrogation he denied that he had anything to do
either with the assassination of President Kennedy or the murder of
Patrolman Tippit.  Captain Fritz of the homicide and robbery bureau
did most of the questioning, but he kept no notes and there were no
stenographic or tape recordings.  Representatives of other law
enforcement agencies were also present, including the FBI and the U.S.
Secret Service.  They occasionally participated in the questioning.
The reports prepared by those present at these interviews are set
forth in appendix XI.  A full discussion of Oswald's detention and
interrogation is presented in chapter V of this report.
<br><br>During the evening of November 22, the Dallas Police Department
performed paraffin tests on Oswald's hands and right cheek in an
apparent effort to determine, by means of a scientific test, whether
Oswald had recently fired a weapon.  The results were positive for the
hands and negative for the right cheek.669 Expert testimony before the
Commission was to the effect that the paraffin test was unreliable 670
in determining whether or not a person has fired a rifle or
revolver.671 The Commission has, therefore, placed no reliance on the
paraffin tests administered by the Dallas police.  (See app.. X, pp.
561-562.)
<br><br>Oswald provided little information during his questioning.
Frequently, however, he was confronted with evidence which he could
not explain, and he resorted to statements which are known to be
lies.672 While Oswald's untrue statements during interrogation were
not considered items of positive proof by the Commission, they had
probative value in deciding the weight to be given to his denials that
he assassinated President Kennedy and killed Patrolman Tippit. Since
independent evidence revealed that Oswald repeatedly and blatantly
lied to the police, the Commission gave little weight to his denials
of guilt.
<a name="denial"></a>
<p></p>
<strong>Denial of Rifle Ownership</strong>
<br><br>From the outset, Oswald denied owning a rifle. On November 23,
Fritz confronted Oswald with the evidence that he had purchased a
rifle under the fictitious name of "Hidell."  Oswald said that this 
<br><br><strong>Page 181</strong>
<br><br>was not true.  Oswald denied that he had a rifle wrapped up in a
blanket in the Paine garage. Oswald also denied owning a rifle and
said that since leaving the Marine Corps he had fired only a small
bore 22 rifle.673  On the afternoon of November 23, Officers H. M.
Moore, R. S. Stovall, and G. F. Rose obtained a search warrant and
examined Oswald's effects in the Paine garage. They discovered two
photographs, each showing Oswald with a rifle and a pistol.674 These
photographs were shown to Oswald on the evening of November 23 and
again on the morning of the 24th.  According to Fritz, Oswald sneered,
saying that they were fake photographs, that he had been photographed
a number of times the day before by the police, that they had
superimposed upon the photographs a rifle and a revolver.675 He told
Fritz a number of times that the smaller photograph was either made
from the larger, or the larger photograph was made from the smaller
and that at the proper time he would show that the pictures were
fakes.  Fritz told him that the two small photographs were found in
the Paine garage. At that point., Oswald refused to answer any further
questions.676  As previously indicated, Marina Oswald testified that
she took the two pictures with her husband's Imperial Reflex camera
when they lived on Neely Street.  Her testimony was fully supported by
a photography expert who testified that in his opinion the pictures
were not composites.677
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="revolver2">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>The Revolver</strong>
<br><br>At the first interrogation, Oswald claimed that his only crime was
carrying a gun and resisting arrest.  When Captain Fritz asked him why
he carried the revolver, he answered, "Well, you know about a pistol.
I just carried it." 678  He falsely alleged that he bought the
revolver in Fort Worth,679 when in fact he purchased it from a
mail-order house in Los Angeles.680
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="aliases">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>The Aliases "Hidell" and "O. H. Lee"</strong>
<br><br>The arresting officers found a forged selective service card
with a picture of Oswald and the name "Alek J. Hidell" in Oswald's
billfold.681  On November 22 and 23, Oswald refused to tell Fritz why
this card was in his possession,682 or to answer any questions
concerning the card.683  On Sunday morning, November 24, Oswald denied
that he knew A. J. Hidell.  Captain Fritz produced the selective
service card bearing the name "Alek J. Hidell."  Oswald became angry
and said, "Now, I've told you all I'm going to tell you about that
card in my billfolds--you have the card yourself and you know as much
about it as I do." 684  At. the last interrogation on November Oswald
admitted to Postal Inspector Holmes that he had rented post office box
2915, Dallas, but denied that he had received a package in this box
addressed to Hidell.  He also denied that he had received the rifle
through this box.685  Holmes reminded Oswald that A. J. 
<br><br><strong>Page 182</strong>
<br><br>Hidell was listed on post office box 30061, New Orleans, as one
entitled to receive mail.  Oswald replied, "I don't know anything
about that."686
<br><br>When asked why he lived at his roominghouse under the name O. H.
Lee, Oswald responded that the landlady simply made a mistake, because
he told her that his name was Lee, meaning his first name.687 An
examination of the roominghouse register revealed that Oswald actually
signed the name O. H. Lee.688
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="rod">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>The Curtain Rod Story</strong>
<br><br>In concluding that Oswald was carrying a rifle in the paper bag on
the morning of November 22, 1963, the Commission found that Oswald
lied when he told Frazier that he was returning to Irving to obtain
curtain rods. When asked about the curtain rod story, Oswald lied
again.  He denied that he had ever told Frazier that he wanted a ride
to Irving to get curtain rods for an apartment.689 He explained that a
party for the Paine children had been planned for the weekend and he
preferred not to be in the Paine house at that time; therefore, he
made his weekly visit on Thursday night.690  Actually, the party for
one of the Paine's children was the preceding weekend, when Marina
Oswald suggested that Oswald remain in Dallas.691  When told that
Frazier and Mrs. Randle had seen him carrying a long heavy package,
Oswald replied, "Well, they was mistaken.  That must have been some
other time he picked me up." 692  In one interview, he told Fritz that
the only sack he carried to work that day was a lunch sack which he
kept on his lap during the ride from Irving to Dallas.693 Frazier
testified before the Commission that Oswald carried no lunch sack that
day.694
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="actionsduring">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Actions During and After Shooting</strong>
<br><br>During the first interrogation on November 22, Fritz asked
Oswald to account for himself at the time the President was shot.
Oswald told him that he ate lunch in the first-floor lunchroom and
then went to the second floor for a Coke which he brought downstairs.
He acknowledged the encounter with the police officer on the second
floor. Oswald told Fritz that after lunch he went outside, talked with
Foreman Bill Shelley for 5 or 10 minutes and then left for home. He
said that he left work because Bill Shelley said that there would be
no more work done that day in the building.695  Shelley denied seeing
Oswald after 12 noon or at any time after the shooting.696 The next
day, Oswald added to his story.  He stated that at the time the
President was shot he was having lunch with "Junior" but he did not
give Junior's last name.697 The only employee at the Depository
Building named "Junior" was James Jarman, Jr.  Jarman testified that
he ate his lunch on the first floor around 5 minutes to 12, and that
he neither ate lunch with nor saw Oswald.698 Jarman did talk to Oswald
that morning:
<br><br><strong>Page 183</strong>
    <blockquote>... he asked me what were the people gathering around on the
    corner for and I told him that the President was supposed to pass that morning, and he asked me did
    I know which way he was coming, and I told him, yes, he probably come down Main and turn on
    Houston and then back again on Elm.  Then he said, "Oh, I see," and that was all.699</blockquote>

<p></p>
<strong>PRIOR ATTEMPT TO KILL</strong>
<br><br><a name="walker"></a><strong>The Attempt on the Life of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker</strong>
<br><br>At approximately 9 p.m., on April 10, 1963, in Dallas, Tex.,
Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker, an active and controversial figure on the
American political scene since his resignation from the U.S. Army in
1961, narrowly escaped death when a rifle bullet fired from outside
his home passed near his head as he was seated at his desk.700 There
were no eyewitnesses, although a 14-year-old boy in a neighboring
house claimed that immediately after the shooting he saw two men, in
separate cars, drive out of a church parking lot adjacent to Walker's
home.701  A friend of Walker's testified that two nights before the
shooting he saw "two men around the house peeking in windows." 702
General Walker gave this information to the police before the
shooting, but it did not help solve the crime. Although the bullet was
recovered from Walker's house (see app. X, p. 562), in the absence of
a weapon it was of little investigatory value.  General Walker hired
two investigators to determine whether a former employee might have
been involved in the shooting.708 Their results were negative.  Until
December 3, 1963, the Walker shooting remained unsolved.
<br><br>The Commission evaluated the following evidence in considering
whether Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shot which almost killed General
Walker: (1) A note which Oswald left for his wife on the evening of
the shooting, (2) photographs found among Oswald's possessions after the
assassination of President Kennedy, (3) firearm identification of the
bullet found in Walker's home, and (4) admissions and other statements
made to Marina Oswald by Oswald concerning the shooting.
<br><br><em>Note left by Oswald</em>.--On December 2, 1963, Mrs. Ruth Paine turned
over to the police some of the Oswalds' belongings, including a
Russian volume entitled "Book of Useful Advice." 704, In this book was
an undated note written in Russian. In translation, the note read as
follows:<ol><li>This is the key to the mailbox which is located in the main
post office in the city on Ervay Street. This is the same street where the drugstore, in which you
always waited is located. You will find the mailbox in the post office which is located 4 blocks
from the drugstore on that street.  I paid for the box last month so don't worry about it.</li></ol><br><br><strong>Page 184</strong>
    <ol start="2"><li>Send the information as to what has happened to me to the
Embassy and include newspaper clippings (should there be anything
about me in the newspapers).  I believe that the Embassy will come
quickly to your assistance on learning everything. 
    </li><li>I paid the house rent on the 2d so don't worry about it. 
    </li><li>Recently I also paid for water and gas.
    </li><li>The money from work will possibly be coming.  The money will be
sent to our post office box. Go to the bank and cash the check.
    </li><li>You can either throw out or give my clothing, etc. away. Do not
keep these.  However, I prefer that you hold on to my personal papers
(military, civil, etc.).
    </li><li>Certain of my documents are in the small blue valise.
    </li><li>The address book can be found on my table in the study should
need same.
    </li><li>We have friends here.  The Red Cross also will help you.
(Red Cross in English).  [sic]
    </li><li>I left you as much money as I could, $60 on the second of the
month.  You and the baby [apparently] can live for another 2 months
using $10 per week.
    </li><li>If I am alive and taken prisoner, the city jail is
located at the end of the bridge through which we always passed on
going to the city (right in the beginning of the city after crossing
the bridge).705</li></ol><br><br>James C. Cadigan, FBI handwriting expert, testified that this note was
written by Lee Harvey Oswald.706
<br><br>Prior to the Walker shooting on April 10, Oswald had been
attending typing classes on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings. He
had quit these classes at least a week before the shooting, which
occurred on a Wednesday night.707  According to Marina Oswald's
testimony, on the night of the Walker shooting, her husband left their
apartment on Neely Street shortly after dinner.  She thought he was
attending a class or was on his own business." 708 When he failed to
return by 10 or 10:30 p.m., Marina Oswald went to his room and
discovered the note.  She testified: "When he came back I asked him
what had happened.  He was very pale.  I don't remember the exact
time, but it was very late.  And he told me not to ask him any
questions.  He only told me he had shot at General Walker." 709 Oswald
told his wife that he did not know whether he had hit Walker;
according to Marina Oswald when he learned on the radio and in the
newspapers the next. day that he had missed, he said that he "was very
sorry that he had not hit him." 710  Marina Oswald's testimony was
fully supported by the note itself which appeared to be the work of a
man expecting to be killed, or imprisoned, or to disappear.  The last
paragraph directed her to the jail and the other paragraphs instructed
her on the disposal of Oswald's personal effects and the management of
her affairs if he should not return.
<br><br>It is clear that the note was written while the Oswalds were
living in Dallas before they moved to New Orleans in the spring of
1963.  
<br><br><strong>Page 185</strong>
<br><br>The references to house rent and payments for water and gas indicated
that the note was written when they were living in a rented apartment;
therefore it could not have been written while Marina Oswald was
living with the Paines.  Moreover, the reference in paragraph 3 to
paying "the house rent on the 2d" would be consistent with the period
when the Oswalds were living on Neely Street since the apartment was
rented on March 3, 1963.  Oswald had paid the first month's rent in
advance on March 2, 1963, and the second month's rent was paid on
either April 2 or April 3.711  The main post office "on Ervay Street"
refers to the post office where Oswald rented box 2915 from October 9,
1962, to May 14, 1963.712  Another statement which limits the time
when it could have been written is the reference "you and the baby,"
which would indicate that it was probably written before the birth of
Oswald's second child on October 20, 1963.
<br><br>Oswald had apparently mistaken the county jail for the city jail.
From Neely Street the Oswalds would have traveled downtown on the
Beckley bus, across the Commerce Street viaduct and into downtown
Dallas through the Triple Underpass.713  Either the viaduct or the
underpass might have been the "bridge" mentioned in the last paragraph
of the note.  The county jail is at the corner of Houston and Main
Streets "right in the beginning of the city" after one travels through
the underpass.
<br><br><em>Photographs</em>.--In her testimony before the Commission in February
1964, Marina Oswald stated that when Oswald returned home on the night
of the Walker shooting, he told her that he had been planning the
attempt for 2 months.  He showed her a notebook 3 days later
containing photographs of General Walker's home and a map of the area
where the house was located.714  Although Oswald destroyed the
notebook,715 three photographs found among Oswald's possessions after
the assassination were identified by Marina Oswald as photographs of
General Walker's house.716  Two of these photographs were taken from
the rear of Walker's house.717  The Commission confirmed, by
comparison with other photographs, that these were, indeed,
photographs of the rear of Walker's house.718  An examination of the
window at the rear of the house, the wall through which the bullet
passed, and the fence behind the house indicated that the bullet was
fired from a position near the point where one of the photographs was
taken.719
<br><br>The third photograph identified by Marina Oswald depicts the
entrance to General Walker's driveway from a back alley.720  Also seen
in the picture is the fence on which Walker's assailant apparently
rested the rifle.721  An examination of certain construction work
appearing in the background of this photograph revealed that the
picture was taken between March 8 and 12, 1963, and most probably on
either March 9 or March 10.722  Oswald purchased the money order for
the rifle on March 12, the rifle was shipped on March 20,728 and the
shooting occurred on April 10.  A photography expert with the FBI was
able to determine that, this picture was taken with the Imperial
Reflex camera owned by Lee Harvey Oswald.724  (See app. X, p. 596.) 
<br><br><strong>Page 186</strong>
<br><br>A fourth photograph, showing a stretch of railroad tracks, was
also identified by Marina Oswald as having been taken by her husband,
presumably in connection with the Walker shooting.725  Investigation
determined that this photograph was taken approximately seven-tenths
of a mile from Walker's house.726 Another photograph of railroad
tracks found among Oswald's possessions was not identified by his
wife, but investigation revealed that it was taken from a point
slightly less than half a mile from General Walker's house.727 Marina
Oswald stated that- when she asked her husband what be had done with
the rifle, he replied that he had buried it in the ground or hidden it
in some bushes and that he also mentioned a railroad track in this
connection.  She testified that several days later Oswald recovered
his rifle and brought it back to their apartment.728
<br><br><em>Firearms identification</em>.--In the room beyond the one in which
General Walker was sitting on the night of the shooting the Dallas
police recovered a badly mutilated bullet which had come to rest on a
stack of paper.729  The Dallas City-County Investigation Laboratory
tried to determine the type of weapon which fired the bullet.  The
oral report was negative because of the battered condition of the
bullet.730 On November 30, 1963, the FBI requested the bullet for
ballistics examination; the Dallas Police Department forwarded it on
December 2, 1963.731
<br><br>Robert A. Frazier, an FBI ballistics identification expert,
testified that he was "unable to reach a conclusion" as to whether or
not the bullet recovered from Walker's house had been fired from the
rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository
Building.  He concluded that "the general rifling characteristics of
the rifle ... are of the same type as those found on the bullet ... and, further, 
on this basis ... the bullet could have been fired
from the rifle on the basis of its land and groove impressions." 732
Frazier testified further that the FBI avoids the category of
"probable" identification. Unless the missile or cartridge case can be
identified as coming from a particular weapon to the exclusion of all
others, the FBI refuses to draw any conclusion as to probability.733	
Frazier testified, however, that he found no microscopic
characteristics or other evidence which would indicate that the bullet
was not fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle owned by Lee Harvey
Oswald.  It was a 6.5-millimeter bullet and, according to Frazier,
"relatively few" types of rifles could produce the characteristics
found on the bullet.734
<br><br>Joseph D. Nicol, superintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Criminal
Identification and Investigation, conducted an independent examination
of this bullet and concluded "that there is a fair probability" that
the bullet was fired from the rifle used in the assassination of
President Kennedy.735 In explaining the difference between his policy
and that of the FBI on the matter of probable identification, Nicol
said:
    <blockquote>I am aware of their position. This is not, I am sure, arrived at
without careful consideration. However, to say that   because one does
not find sufficient marks for identification that it is a negative,</blockquote>
<strong>Page 187</strong>
    <blockquote>I think is going overboard in the other direction. And for purposes of
probative value, for whatever it might be worth, in the absence of
very definite negative evidence, I think it is permissible to say that
in an exhibit such as 573 there is enough on it to say that it could
have come, and even perhaps a little stronger, to say that it probably
came from this, without going so far as to say to the exclusion of all
other guns. This I could not do. 736</blockquote>
Although the Commission recognizes that neither expert was able to
state that the bullet which missed General Walker was fired from
Oswald's rifle to the exclusion of all others, this testimony was
considered probative when combined with the other testimony linking
Oswald to the shooting.
<br><br><em>Additional corroborative evidence</em>.--The admissions made to Marina
Oswald by her husband are an important element in the evidence that
Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shot at General Walker. As shown above,
the note and the photographs of Walker's house and of the nearby
railroad tracks provide important corroboration for her account of the
incident.  Other details described by Marina Oswald coincide with
facts developed independently of her statements. She testified that
her husband had postponed his attempt to kill Walker until that
Wednesday because he had heard that there was to be a gathering at the
church next door to Walker's house on that evening.  He indicated that
he wanted more people in the vicinity at the time of the attempt so
that his arrival and departure would not attract great attention.737
An official of this church told FBI agents that services are held
every Wednesday at the church except during the month of August.738
Marina Oswald also testified that her husband had used a bus to return
home.739  A study of the bus routes indicates that Oswald could have
taken any one of several different buses to Walker's house or to a
point near the railroad tracks where he may have concealed the
rifle.740  It would have been possible for him to take different
routes in approaching and leaving the scene of the shooting.
<br><br><em>Conclusion</em>.--Based on (1) the contents of the note which Oswald
left for his wife on April 10, 1963, (2) the photographs found among
Oswald's possessions, (3) the testimony of firearms identification
experts, and (4) the testimony of Marina Oswald, the Commission has
concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald attempted to take the life of Maj.
Gen. Edwin A. Walker (Resigned, U.S. Army) on April 10, 1963.  The
finding that Lee Harvey Oswald attempted to murder a public figure in
April 1963 was considered of probative value in this investigation,
although the Commission's conclusion concerning the identity of the
assassin was based on evidence independent of the finding that Oswald
attempted to kill General Walker.
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="nixon">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Richard M. Nixon Incident</strong>
<br><br>Another alleged threat by Oswald against a public figure
involved former Vice President Richard M. Nixon.  In January 1964,
Marina Oswald and her business manager, James Martin, told Robert
Oswald, 
<br><br><strong>Page 188</strong>
<br><br>Lee Harvey Oswald's brother, that Oswald had once threatened to shoot
former Vice President Richard M. Nixon.741 When Marina Oswald
testified before the Commission on February 3-6, 1964, she had failed
to mention the incident when she was asked whether Oswald had ever
expressed any hostility toward any official of the United States.742
The Commission first learned of this incident when Robert Oswald
related it to FBI agents on February 19, 1964,743 and to the
Commission on February 21.744
<br><br>Marina Oswald appeared before the Commission again on June 11,
1964, and testified that a few days before her husband's departure
from Dallas to New Orleans on April 24, 1963, he finished reading a
morning newspaper "... and put on a good suit.  I saw that he took a
pistol. I asked him where he was going, and why he was getting
dressed.  He answered 'Nixon is coming.  I want to go and have a
look."  He also said that he would use the pistol if the opportunity
arose.745  She reminded him that after the Walker shooting he had
promised never to repeat such an act. Marina Oswald related the events
which followed:
    <blockquote>I called him into the bathroom and I closed the door and I wanted to
prevent him and then I started to cry.  And I told him that he
shouldn't do this, and that he had promised me.<br>
&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
I remember that I held him. We actually struggled for several minutes and then he quieted down.746</blockquote>

She stated that it was not physical force which kept him from leaving
the house.  "I couldn't keep him from going out if he really wanted
to." 747  After further questioning she stated that she might have
been confused about shutting him in the bathroom, but that "there is
no doubt that he got dressed and got a gun."
<br><br>Oswald's revolver was shipped from Los Angeles on March 20, 1963,
749 and he left for New Orleans on April 24, 1963. 750  No edition of
either Dallas newspaper during the period January 1, 1963, to May 15,
1963, mentioned any proposed visit by Mr. Nixon to Dallas.751 Mr.
Nixon advised the Commission that the only time he was in Dallas in
1963 was on November 20-21, 1963.752  An investigation failed to
reveal any invitation extended to Mr. Nixon during the period when
Oswald's threat reportedly occurred.753  The Commission has concluded,
therefore, that regardless of what Oswald may have said to his wife he
was not actually planning to shoot Mr. Nixon at that time in Dallas.
<br><br>On April 23, 1963, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was in
Dallas for a visit which had been publicized in the Dallas newspapers
throughout April.754  The Commission asked Marina Oswald whether she
might have misunderstood the object of her husband's threat. She
stated, "there is no question that in this incident it was a question
of Mr. Nixon." 755  When asked later whether it might have been 
<br><br><strong>Page 189</strong>
<br><br>Mr. Johnson, she said, "Yes, no.  I am getting a little confused with
so many questions.  I was absolutely convinced it was Nixon and now
after all these questions I wonder if I am right in my mind? 756 She
stated further that Oswald had only mentioned Nixon's name once during
the incident.757 Marina Oswald might have misunderstood her husband.
Mr. Johnson was the then Vice President and his visit took place on
April 23d. 758  This was 1 day before Oswald left for New Orleans and
Marina appeared certain that the Nixon incident "wasn't the day
before.  Perhaps 3 days before." 759
<br><br>Marina Oswald speculated that the incident may have been
unrelated to an actual threat.  She said, 
    <blockquote>... It might have been that he was just. trying to test me. He
was the kind of person who could try and wound  somebody in that way.
Possibly he didn't want to go out at all but was just doing this all
as a sort of joke, not really as a joke but rather to simply wound me,
to make me feel bad.760</blockquote>

In the absence of other evidence that Oswald actually intended to
shoot someone at this time, the Commission concluded that the
incident, as described by Marina Oswald, was of no probative value in
the Commission's decision concerning the identity of the assassin of
President Kennedy.
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="capability">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>OSWALD'S RIFLE CAPABILITY</strong>
<br><br>In deciding whether Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots which killed
President Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally, the Commission
considered whether Oswald, using his own rifle, possessed the
capability to hit his target with two out of three shots under the
conditions described in chapter Ill.  The Commission evaluated (1) the
nature of the shots, (2) Oswald's Marine training in marksmanship, (3)
his experience and practice after leaving the Marine Corps, and (4)
the accuracy of the weapon and the quality of the ammunition.
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="nature">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>The Nature of the Shots</strong>
<br><br>For a rifleman situated on the sixth floor of the Texas School
Book Depository Building the shots were at a slow-moving target
proceeding on a downgrade in virtually a straight line with the
alinement of the assassin's rifle, at a range of 177 to 266 feet.761
An aerial photograph of Dealey Plaza shows that Elm Street runs at an
angle so that the President would have been moving in an almost
straight line away from the assassin's rifle.762  (See Commission
Exhibit No. 876, p. 33.)  In addition, the 3&deg; downward slope of Elm
Street was of assistance in eliminating at least some of the
adjustment which is ordinarily required when a marksman must raise his
rifle as a target moves farther away.763
<br><br>Four marksmanship experts testified before the Commission. Maj.
Eugene D. Anderson, assistant head of the Marksmanship Branch of 
<br><br><strong>Page 190</strong>
<br><br>the U.S. Marine Corps, testified that the shots which struck the
President in the neck and in the head were "not ... particularly
difficult." 764    Robert A. Frazier, FBI expert in firearms
identification and training, said:
    <blockquote>From my own experience in shooting over the years, when you shoot at
175 feet or 260 feet, which is less than 100 yards, with a telescopic
sight, you should not have any difficulty in hitting your target.<br>
&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;<br>
I mean it requires no training at all to shoot a weapon with a
telescopic sight once you know that you must put the crosshairs on the
target and that is all that is necessary.765</blockquote>

Ronald Simmons, chief of the U.S. Army Infantry Weapons Evaluation
Branch of the Ballistics Research Laboratory, said: "Well, in order to
achieve three hits, it would not be required that a man be an
exceptional shot.  A proficient man with this weapon, yes." 766 
<br><br>The effect of a four-power telescopic sight on the difficulty
of these shots was considered in detail by M. Sgt. James A. Zahm,
noncommissioned officer in charge of the Marksmanship Training Unit in
the Weapons Training Battalion of the Marine Corps School at Quantico,
Va.767  Referring to a rifle with a four-power telescope, Sergeant
Zahm said:
    <blockquote>... this is the ideal type of weapon for moving targets ... 768<br>
&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;<br>
... Using the scope, rapidly working a bolt and using the scope to
relocate your target quickly and at the same time when you locate that
target you identify it and the crosshairs are in close relationship to
the point you want to shoot at, it just takes a minor move in aiming
to bring the crosshairs to bear, and then it is a quick squeeze.769
&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;<br>
I consider it a real advantage, particularly at the range of 100
yards, in identifying your target.  It. allows you to see your target
clearly, and it is still of a minimum amount of power that it doesn't
exaggerate your own body movements.  It just is an aid in seeing in
the fact that you only have the one element, the crosshair, in
relation to the target as opposed to iron sights with aligning the
sights and then aligning them on the target.770</blockquote>

Characterizing the four-power scope as "a real aid, an extreme aid" in
rapid fire shooting, Sergeant Zahm expressed the opinion that the shot
which struck President Kennedy in the neck at 176.9 to 190.8 feet was
"very easy" and the shot which struck the President in the 
<br><br><strong>Page 191</strong>
<br><br>head at a distance of 265.3 feet was "an easy shot." 771  After
viewing photographs depicting the alinement of Elm Street in relation
to the Texas School Book Depository Building, Zahm stated further:
    <blockquote>This is a definite advantage to the shooter, the vehicle moving
directly away from him and the downgrade of the street, and he being
in an elevated position made an almost stationary target while he was
aiming in, very little movement if any.772</blockquote>
<a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="marine">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Oswald's Marine Training</strong>
<br><br>In accordance with standard Marine procedures, Oswald received
extensive training in marksmanship.773  During the first week of an
intensive 8-week training period he received instruction in sighting,
aiming, and manipulation of the trigger.774  He went through a series
of exercises called dry firing where he assumed all positions which
would later be used in the qualification course.775  After
familiarization with live ammunition in the .22 rifle and .22 pistol,
Oswald, like all Marine recruits, received training on the rifle range
at distances up to 500 yards, firing 50 rounds each day for five
days.776
<br><br>Following that training, Oswald was tested in December of 1956,
and obtained a score of 212, which was 2 points above the minimum for
qualifications as a "sharpshooter" in a scale of marksman--sharpshooter--expert.777  
In May of 1959, on another range,
Oswald scored 191, which was 1 point over the minimum for ranking as a
"marksman." 778  The Marine Corps records maintained on Oswald further
show that he had fired and was familiar with the Browning Automatic
rifle, .45 caliber pistol, and 12-gage riot gun.779
<br><br>Based on the general Marine Corps ratings, Lt. Col. A. G. Folsom,
Jr., head, Records Branch, Personnel Department, Headquarters U.S.
Marine Corps, evaluated the sharpshooter qualification as a "fairly
good shot." and a low marksman rating as a "rather poor shot."
<br><br>When asked to explain the different scores achieved by Oswald on
the two occasions when he fired for record, Major Anderson said:
    <blockquote>... when he fired that [212] he had just completed a very
intensive preliminary training period.  He had the services   of an
experienced highly trained coach.  He had high motivation.  He had
presumably a good to excellent rifle and good ammunition. We have
nothing here to show under what conditions the B course was fired.  It
might well have been a bad day for firing the rifle--windy, rainy,
dark.  There is little probability that he had a good, expert coach,
and he probably didn't have as high a motivation because he was no
longer in recruit training and under the care of the drill instructor.
 There is some possibility that the rifle he was firing might not have
been as good a rifle as the rifle that he was firing in his A course
firing, because [he] may well have carried this rifle for quite some
time, and it got banged around in normal usage. 781</blockquote>
<strong>Page 192</strong>
<br><br>Major Anderson concluded:
    <blockquote>I would say that as compared to other Marines receiving the same
type of training, that Oswald was a good shot, somewhat better than or
equal to--better than the average let us say.  As compared to a
civilian who had not received this intensive training, he would be
considered as a good to excellent shot.782</blockquote>
When Sergeant Zahm was asked whether Oswald's Marine Corps
training would have made it easier to operate a rifle with a
four-power scope, he replied:
    
    <blockquote>Based on that training, his basic knowledge in sight manipulation
and trigger squeeze and what not, I would say that he would be capable
of sighting that rifle in well, firing it, with 10 rounds.783</blockquote>
After reviewing Oswald's marksmanship scores, Sergeant Zahm concluded:
    <blockquote>I would say in the Marine Corps he is a good shot, slightly above
average, and as compared to the average male of his age throughout the
civilian, throughout the United States, that he is an excellent
shot.784</blockquote>
<a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="practice">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Oswald's Rifle Practice Outside the Marines</strong>
<br><br>During one of his leaves from the Marines, Oswald hunted with his
brother Robert, using a .22 caliber bolt-action rifle belonging either
to Robert or Robert's in-laws.785  After he left the Marines and
before departing for Russia, Oswald, his brother, and a third
companion went hunting for squirrels and rabbits.786  On that occasion
Oswald again used a bolt-action .22 caliber rifle; and according to
Robert, Lee Oswald exhibited an average amount of proficiency with
that weapon.787  While in Russia, Oswald obtained a hunting license,
joined a hunting club and went hunting about six times, as discussed
more fully in chapter VI.788  Soon after Oswald returned from the
Soviet Union he again went hunting with his brother, Robert, and used
a borrowed .22 caliber bolt-action rifle.789  After Oswald purchased
the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, he told his wife that he practiced with
it.790  Marina Oswald testified that on one occasion she saw him take
the rifle, concealed in a raincoat, from the house on Neely Street.
Oswald told her he was going to practice with it. 791 According to
George De Mohrenschildt, Oswald said that he went target shooting with
that rifle.792
<br><br>Marina Oswald testified that in New Orleans in May of 1963, she
observed Oswald sitting with the rifle on their screened porch at
night, sighting with the telescopic lens and operating the bolt.798
Examination of the cartridge cases found on the sixth floor of the
Depository 
<br><br><strong>Page 193</strong>
<br><br>Building established that they had been previously loaded and ejected
from the assassination rifle, which would indicate that Oswald
practiced operating the bolt.794
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="accuracy">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Accuracy of Weapon</strong>
<br><br>It will be recalled from the discussion in chapter III that the
assassin in all probability hit two out of the three shots during the
maximum time span of 4.8 to 5.6 seconds if the second shot missed, or,
if either the first or third shots missed, the assassin fired the
three shots during a minimum time span of 7.1 to 7.9 seconds.795  A
series of tests were performed to determine whether the weapon and
ammunition used in the assassination were capable of firing the shots
which were fired by the assassin on November 22, 1963. The ammunition
used by the assassin was manufactured by Western Cartridge Co. of East
Alton, III.  In tests with the Mannlicher-Carcano C2766 rifle, over
100 rounds of this ammunition were fired by the FBI and the Infantry
Weapons Evaluation Branch of the U.S. Army. There were no misfires.796
<br><br>In an effort to test the rifle under conditions which simulated
those which prevailed during the assassination, the Infantry Weapons
Evaluation Branch of the Ballistics Research Laboratory had expert
riflemen fire the assassination weapon from a tower at three
silhouette targets at distances of 175, 240, and 265 feet. The target
at 265 feet was placed to the right of the 240-foot target which was
in turn placed to the right of the closest silhouette.797  Using the
assassination rifle mounted with the telescopic sight, three marksmen,
rated as master by the National Rifle Association, each fired two
series of three shots. In the first series the firers required time
spans of 4.6, 6.75, and 8.25 seconds respectively.  On the second
series they required 5.15, 6.45, and 7 seconds.  None of the marksmen
had any practice with the assassination weapon except for exercising
the bolt for 2 or 3 minutes on a dry run. They had not even pulled the
trigger because of concern about breaking the firing pin.798
<br><br>The marksmen took as much time as they wanted for the first target
and all hit the target.799  For the first four attempts, the firers
missed the second shot. by several inches. 800 The angle from the
first to the second shot was greater than from the second to the
third shot and required a movement in the basic firing position of the
marksmen.801 This angle was used in the test because the majority of
the eyewitnesses to the assassination stated that there was a shorter
interval between shots two and three than between shots one and
two.802  As has been shown in chapter III, if the three shots were
fired within a period of from 4.8 to 5.6 seconds, the shots would have
been evenly spaced and the assassin would not have incurred so sharp
an angular movement.803 
<br><br>Five of the six shots hit the third target where the angle of
movement of the weapon was small.804  On the basis of these results,
Simmons testified that in his opinion the probability of hitting the
targets at the relatively short range at which they were hit was very
high.805  
<br><br><strong>Page 194</strong>
<br><br>Considering the various probabilities which may have prevailed during
the actual assassination, the highest level of firing performance
which would have been required of the assassin and the C2766 rifle
would have been to fire three times and hit the target twice within a
span of 4.8 to 5.6 seconds.  In fact, one of the firers in the rapid
fire test in firing his two series of three shots, hit the target
twice within a span of 4.6 and 5.15 seconds.  The others would have
been able to reduce their times if they had been given the opportunity
to become familiar with the movement of the bolt and the trigger
pull.806  Simmons testified that familiarity with the bolt could be
achieved in dry practice and, as has been indicated above, Oswald
engaged in such practice.807 If the assassin missed either the first
or third shot, he had a total of between 4.8 and 5.6 seconds between
the two shots which hit and a total minimum time period of from 7.1 to
7.9 seconds for all three shots. All three of the firers in these
tests were able to fire the rounds within the time period which would
have been available to the assassin under those conditions.
<br><br>Three FBI firearms experts tested the rifle in order to determine
the speed with which it could be fired.  The purpose of this
experiment was not to test the rifle under conditions which prevailed
at the time of the assassination but to determine the maximum speed at
which it could be fired. The three FBI experts each fired three shots
from the weapon at 15 yards in 6, 7, and 9 seconds, and one of these
agents, Robert A. Frazier, fired two series of three shots at 25 yards
in 4.6 and 4.8 seconds.808 At 15 yards each man's shots landed within
the size of a dime.809 The shots fired by Frazier at the range of 25
yards landed within an area of 2 inches and 5 inches respectively.810
Frazier later fired four groups of three shots at a distance of 100
yards in 5.9, 6.2, 5.6, and 6.5 seconds. Each series of three shots
landed within areas ranging in diameter from 3 to 5 inches.811
Although all of the shots were a few inches high and to the right of
the target., this was because of a defect in the scope which was
recognized by the FBI agents and which they could have compensated for
if they were aiming to hit a bull's-eye.812 They were instead firing
to determine how rapidly the weapon could be fired and the area within
which three shots could be placed.  Frazier testified that while he
could not tell when the defect occurred, but that a person familiar
with the weapon could compensate for it.813  Moreover, the defect was
one which would have assisted the assassin aiming at a target which
was moving away. Frazier said, "The fact that the crosshairs are set
high would actually compensate for any lead which had to be taken. So
that if you aimed with this weapon as it actually was received at the
laboratory, it would not be necessary to take any lead whatsoever in
order to hit the intended object.  The scope would accomplish the lead
for you." Frazier added that the scope would cause a slight miss to
the right. It should be noted, however, that the President's car was
curving slightly to the right when the third shot was fired.
<br><br>Based on these tests the experts agreed that the assassination
rifle was an accurate weapon.  Simmons described it as "quite
accurate," 
<br><br><strong>Page 195</strong>
<br><br>in  fact, as accurate as current military rifles.814  Frazier
testified that the rifle was accurate, that it had less recoil than
the average military rifle and that one would not have to be an expert
marksman to have accomplished the assassination with the weapon which
was used.815
<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="conclusion5">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>
<br><br>The various tests showed that the Mannlicher-Carcano was an accurate
rifle and that the use of a four-power scope was a substantial aid to
rapid, accurate firing. Oswald's Marine training in marksmanship, his
other rifle experience and his established familiarity with this
particular weapon show that he possessed ample capability to commit
the assassination. Based on the known facts of the assassination, the
Marine marksmanship experts, Major Anderson and Sergeant Zahm,
concurred in the opinion that Oswald had the capability to fire three
shots, with two hits, within 4.8 and 5.6 seconds.816  Concerning the
shots which struck the President in the back of the neck, Sergeant
Zahm testified: "With the equipment he [Oswald] had and with his
ability I consider it a very easy shot." 817 Having fired this slot
the assassin was then required to hit the target one more time within
a space of from 4.8 to 5.6 seconds. On the basis of Oswald's training
and the accuracy of the weapon as established by the tests, the
Commission concluded that Oswald was capable of accomplishing this
second hit even if there was an intervening shot which missed.  The
probability of hitting the President a second time would have been
markedly increased if, in fact, he had missed either the first or
third shots thereby leaving a time span of 4.8 to 5.6' seconds between
the two shots which struck their mark.  The Commission agrees with the
testimony of Marine marksmanship expert Zahm that it was easy shot" to
hit some part of the President's body, and that the range where the

<br><br><a href="chapter-4.html#top" name="conclusion6">Return to Top</a><br><br><strong>CONCLUSION</strong>
<br><br>On the basis of the evidence reviewed in this chapter, the
Commission has found that Lee Harvey Oswald (1) owned and possessed
the rifle used to kill President Kennedy and wound Governor Connally,
(2) brought this rifle into the Depository Building on the morning of
the assassination, (3) was present, at the time of the assassination,
at the window from which the shots were fired (4) killed Dallas Police
Officer J. D. Tippit in an apparent attempt to escape, (5) resisted
arrest by drawing a fully loaded pistol and attempting to shoot 
another police officer, (6) lied to the police after his arrest
concerning important substantive matters, (7) attempted, in April
1963, to kill Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker, and (8) possessed the
capability with a rifle which would have enabled him to commit the
assassination.  On the basis of these findings the Commission has
concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin of President
Kennedy.
