<strong>EARLY YEARS</strong>

<p>Marguerite Claverie, the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald, was born in

New Orleans in 1907,1 into a family of French and German extraction. 2

 Her mother died a few years after Marguerite was born leaving her

and five other young children in the care of their father, a streetcar

conductor.3 Although Marguerite describes herself as a child of one

parent," she recalls being one of the most popular young ladies in the

[grammar] school," and thinks of her childhood as a "very full happy"

one.4 Her older sister, Mrs. Lillian Murret, remembers Marguerite as

"a very pretty child, a very beautiful girl," 5 as does a former

acquaintance, Clem H. Sehrt, who knew the Claveries.6 The family was

poor but, according to Mrs. Murret, was a "happy family ... singing

all the time."7 Marguerite had 1 year of high school.8 Shortly before

she was 17, she went to work as a receptionist for a law firm in New

Orleans?</p>

<p>In August 1929, while she was still working at the law firm,

Marguerite married Edward John Pic, Jr.,10 a quiet man of her own age,

who worked as a clerk for T. Smith &amp; Son, a New Orleans stevedoring

company.11 The marriage was not a success, and by the summer of 1931

she and Pic were separated.12 Marguerite was then 3 months pregnant;

she told her family that Pic did not want any children and refused to

support her.13 Pic ascribed the separation simply to their inability

to get along together.14 A boy was born on January 17, 1932, whom

Marguerite named John Edward Pic.15 Pic saw his son occasionally until

he was about 1 year old; after that, he did not see the boy again 16

but contributed to his support until he was 18 years old.17</p>

<p>During her separation from her first husband, Marguerite saw a

great deal of Robert Edward Lee Oswald, an insurance premium

collector,18 who also was married but was separated from his wife.19

In 1933, Marguerite was divorced from Pic20 and, Oswald's wife also

having obtained a divorce,12 they were married in a Lutheran church on

July 20.22 Marguerite has described the period of her marriage to

Oswald as "the only happy part" of her life.23 A son was born on April

7, 1934, who was named for his father; 24 Oswald wanted to adopt John

Pic, but his mother objected on the ground that John's father might

cut off the support payments.25 In 1938, the Oswalds purchased a new

house on Alvar Street for $3,900,26 in what John remembered as "a

rather nice neighborhood." 27 The house was across the street from the

William Frantz School,28 which first John and</p>

 <strong>Page 670</strong>

<p>later both he and Robert, Jr., attended. 29 On August 19, 1939, little

more than a year after the Oswalds bought the Alvar Street house,

Robert Oswald died suddenly of a heart attack. 30

</p>
<p>Two months later, on October 18, 1939, a second son was born.31 He

was named Lee after his father; Harvey was his paternal grandmother's

maiden name. 32 For a while after her husband's death, Mrs. Oswald

remained in the Alvar Street house without working; she probably lived

on life insurance proceeds. 33 Sometime in 1940, she rented the house

to Dr. Bruno F. Mancuso the doctor who had delivered Lee.34 (Dr.

Mancuso continued to rent the house until 1944,35 when Marguerite

obtained a judgment of possession against him.36 She sold the house

for $6,500 to the First Homestead and Savings Association, which

resold it to Dr. Mancuso.)37 She herself moved to a rented house at

1242 Congress Street, where she lived for about half a year.38 For

part of this period after Oswald's death, the two older boys were

placed in the Infant Jesus College, a Catholic boarding school in

Algiers, La., a suburb of New Orleans. 39 Neither they nor their

mother liked this arrangement, 40 which John thought was intended to

save money;41 it lasted for less than a year, after which the boys

returned to the school Frantz and then transferred to the George

Washington Elementary School. 42</p>



<p>On March 5, 1941, Mrs. Oswald purchased a frame 43 house at 1010

Bartholomew Street, for $1,300.44 According to John's recollection,

the neighborhood was not as pleasant as Alvar Street; the house had a

backyard, and the family kept a dog named "Sunshine." 45 A neighbor,

Mrs. Viola Peterman, recalls that Mrs. Oswald kept to herself but

appeared to be "a good mother to her children." 46 She opened a shop

in the front room, where she sold things like sewing"'supplies and

small groceries.47 Oswald's Notion Shop, as it was called, failed to

make money,49 and on January 16, 1942, Mrs. Oswald sold the house back

to the Third District Home Association, from which she had purchased

it, for a profit of $800.50</p>

<p>Probably in contemplation of the sale of the house, Mrs. Oswald

applied in December 1941 to the Evangelical Lutheran Bethlehem Orphan

Asylum Association for the admission of her two older sons to the

orphan asylum, known as the Bethlehem Children's Home; she stated on

the application that she could contribute $20 per month to their

maintenance and would supply shoes and clothing.51 She had inquired

also about Lee, who was too young to be admitted. 52 John and Robert

were accepted and entered the home on January 3, 1942. 53</p>

<p>Mrs. Oswald moved to an apartment at 831 Pauline Street,54 and

returned to work. In December 1942, she listed her occupation as

"telephone operator"; 55 this may be the job she held at the

Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., a company for which she worked at some

point during this period. 56 She left Lee for much of this time with

his aunt, Mrs. Murret, who thought him a good looking, friendly child,

but could not devote a great deal of attention to him because she had

five children of her own. 57 In the late spring of 1942, Lee was

watched for several weeks by Mrs. Thomas Roach, who lived with her

husband in the</p>

 <strong>Page 671</strong>

<p>same house as the Oswalds.58 Lee evidently did not get along with Mrs.

Roach who told the next occupant of the house that Lee was a bad,

unmanageable child who threw his toy gun at her.59 Apparently

referring to the Roaches, Mrs. Oswald testified that she had once

hired a couple to care for Lee; the couple neglected him, so she "put

them out" and cared for Lee herself until Mrs. Murret was able to help

her again. 60 Soon after the incident with the Roaches, Mrs. Oswald

moved again,61 this time to 111 Sherwood Forest Drive, near the

Murrets. 62</p>

<p>Mrs. Murret took care of Lee for several months longer. Near Lee's

third birthday, Mrs. Oswald again inquired about his admission into

the Bethlehem Children's Home, 63 perhaps because a disagreement with

her sister made it impossible to leave him with her any longer.64 He

was admitted on December 26.65 On his application, Mrs. Oswald agreed

to contribute $10 per month and to supply shoes and clothing, as for

the other boys. 66</p>

<p>Lee remained in the home for about 13 months, but according to

John's testimony, left on several occasions to spend short periods of

time with his mother or the Murrets. 67 John and Robert have pleasant

memories of the home,68 which apparently gave the children a good deal

of freedom.69 Robert described it as nondenominational but having "a

Christian atmosphere"; "it might have been just a Protestant home." 70

Mrs. Oswald visited them regularly, 71 and they occasionally left the

home to visit her or the Murrets.72</p>

<p>In July 1943, Mrs. Oswald was hired to manage a small hosiery

store.73 This is probably the store to which she referred in her

testimony as the "Princess Hosiery Shop on Canal Street," at which,

she testified, she was left by herself and "in 6 days' time ...

hired four girls." 74  Her employer remembers her as a neat,

attractive, and hardworking woman, an aggressive person who would make

a good manager. 75  She was not good with figures, however, and after

several months he discharged her. 76 At about this same time, she met

Edwin A. Ekdahl, an electrical engineer older than herself, who was

originally from Boston but was then working in the area. 77 They saw

each other often. Ekdahl met the boys 78 and, according to John's

testimony, on at least one occasion, they all spent a weekend at a

summer resort area in Covington, La. 79</p>

<p>By January 1944, Mrs. Oswald and Ekdahl had decided to marry.80

She withdrew Lee from the Children's Home 81 and moved with him to

Dallas, where Ekdahl expected to be located. 82 They planned to

postpone the marriage until the end of the school year so that the

older boys could complete the year at the home before they left it.83

In the meantime, she would care for Ekdahl,84 who was recovering from

a serious illness, probably a heart attack. 85 Mrs. Oswald has

testified that when she arrived in Dallas, she decided that she did

not want to marry Ekdahl after all.86 Using part of the proceeds from

the sale of the Alvar Street house,87 she purchased a house at 4801

Victor Street,88 a portion of which she rented. 89 In June, John and

Robert left the Children's Home and joined their mother in</p>

 <strong>Page 672</strong>

<p>Dallas.90 They entered the nearby Davy Crockett Elementary School the

following September.91</p>
<p>
 Ekdahl visited Mrs. Oswald on weekends and stayed at Victor

Street. 92 By the following year she had resolved her doubts about

marrying him, influenced in part by his substantial income 93 and

perhaps by the visit some time earlier of his sister, who favored the

marriage because of his ill health.94 Explaining that she expected to

travel a great deal, Mrs. Oswald tried unsuccessfully to return the

older boys to the home in February 1945.95 She and Ekdahl were married

in May.96 After a brief honeymoon, they returned to Victor Street.97

</p><p>Ekdahl got along well with the boys, on whom he lavished much

attention.98 John testified that Ekdahl treated them as if they were

his own children and that Lee seemed to find in Ekdahl "the father he

never had"; John recalled that on one occasion he told Lee that Ekdahl

and his mother had become reconciled after a separation, and that

"this seemed to really elate Lee, this made him really happy that they

were getting back together." 99</p><p>



Because Ekdahl's business required him to make frequent trips, in

September, John and Robert were placed in the Chamberlain-Hunt

Military Academy at Port Gibson, Miss.;100 their mother paid the

tuition herself, using the proceeds from the sale of the Alvar Street

property. 101 They remained at the academy for the next 3 years,

returning home only for or vacations. 102 Lee accompanied his parents

on their travels.103 Mrs. Myrtle Evans, who had known both Marguerite

and Ekdahl before their marriage,104 testified that Marguerite

insisted on keeping Lee with her; Mrs. Evans thought that Marguerite

was "too close" to Lee and "spoiled him to death," which hurt her

marriage to Ekdahl.105

</p><p>Sometime in the fall after John and Robert were at boarding

school, the Ekdahls moved to Benbrook, a suburb of Fort Worth, where

they lived on Granbury Road, 106 in a house of stone or brick, set on

a large plot of land.107 Records of the Benbrook Common School show

Lee's admission into the first grade on October 31; his birth date is

incorrectly given as July 9, 1939, his mother presumably having given

that date to satisfy the age requirement. 108  On February 8, 1946, he

was admitted to the Harris Hospital in Fort Worth with "acute

mastoiditis."109 A mastoidectomy was performed without complications,

and Lee left the hospital in 4 days.110 (In 1955, Lee indicated on a

school form that he had an "abnormal ear drum in left ear," 111

presumably a reference to the mastoidectomy; but when he entered the

Marines year later, physical examination disclosed no physical

defects.)

</p><p>The Ekdahls' marriage quickly broke down. Before they had been

married a year, Marguerite suspected Ekdahl of infidelity.113 She

thought him stingy, 114 and there were frequent arguments about his

insistence that she account for her expenditures and his refusal to

share his money with her.115 In the summer of 1946, she left Ekdahl,

picked up John and Robert at Chamberlain-Hunt, and moved with the boys

to Covington, La., 116  where they lived for at least part of the time

</p><p><strong>Page 673</strong>

</p><p>at 311 Vermont Street.117 Mrs. Evans described them at Covington,

possibly during this summer, as "really a happy family"; Lee seemed

like a normal boy but "kept to himself" and seemed not "to want to be

with any other children." 118 The separation continued after the two

boys returned to boarding school, and in September Lee was enrolled in

the Covington Elementary School.119 His record at Benbrook had been

satisfactory he was present on 82 school days and absent on 15, and

received all A's and B's 120--but he had not completed the work of the

first grade, in which he was enrolled for a second time.121

</p><p>Lee received no grades at the Covington School, from which he was

withdrawn on January 23, 1947,122 because his parents, now reconciled,

were moving to Fort Worth, where they lived at 1505 Eighth Avenue.123

Four days later, he enrolled in the Clayton Public School; he was

still in the first grade, which he completed in May with B's in every

subject except physical education and health, in which he received

A's. 124  In the fall, he entered the second grade in the same school

but, relations between his parents having deteriorated again, was

withdrawn before any grades were recorded.125

</p><p>After the move to Fort Worth, the Ekdahls continued to argue

frequently; according to John, "they would have a fight about every

other day and he would leave and come back." 126 That summer,

Marguerite obtained what she regarded as proof that Ekdahl was having

some sort of affair. According to her testimony, a neighbor told her

that Ekdahl had been living on Eighth Avenue with another woman while

she was in Covington.127 Then, at a time when Ekdahl was supposed to

be out of town,128 she went with John and several of his friends to an

apartment in Fort Worth; one of the boys posed as a telegram carrier,

and when the door opened she pushed her way into the apartment and

found Ekdahl in his shirt sleeves in the company of a woman in a

negligee.129

</p><p>Despite this apparent confirmation of her suspicions, Marguerite

continued to live with Ekdahl until January 1948.130 In January,

according to Ekdahl's allegations in the subsequent divorce

proceedings, she "directed ... [him] to leave the home immediately

and never to return," which he did.131 Ekdahl filed suit for divorce

in March.132 The complaint alleged that Marguerite constantly nagged

Ekdahl and argued "with reference to money matters," accused him of

infidelity, threw things at him, and finally ordered him out of the

house; that these acts were unprovoked by Ekdahl's conduct toward her;

that her acts endangered his already impaired health; and that her

"excesses, harsh and cruel treatment and outrages" toward him made it

impossible for them to live together.133 She denied all these

allegations. 134  After a trial, at which John testified and, he

thought, Lee was called to the stand but was excused without

testifying,135 the jury found on special issues that Marguerite was

"guilty of excesses, cruel treatment, or outrages" unprovoked by

Ekdahl's conduct.

</p><p>June 24, the court granted the divorce and approved an agreement

between the parties disposing of their property between them and

</p><p><strong>Page 674</strong>

</p><p>awarding Marguerite $1,500; at her request, the divorce restored to

Marguerite her former name, Marguerite C. Oswald.137

</p><p>While the divorce suit was pending, Marguerite moved from Eighth

Avenue to a house on 3300 Willing Street, next to railroad tracks.138

The boys found her there in May when they returned from the military

academy; for John, the move signified that they "were back down in the

lower class again." 139 Lee's withdrawal from the Clayton School on

March 18, 1948, 140 probably coincided with the move to Willing

Street. He entered the Clark Elementary School on the following day,

and in June completed the second grade with a record mostly of B's and

A's.141 Philip Vinson, a classmate at the Clayton School has described

Lee at, that time as "a quiet type of kids" who "didn't make a lot of

noise." 142  Lee was "stocky and well built," which made other boys

look up to him and regard him as the leader of one of their schoolyard

"gangs." 143 Vinson thought that Lee was not a bully and got along

with his classmates, but had the impression that he rarely played with

them or brought them home after school.144

</p><p>Shortly after the divorce, Mrs. Oswald purchased a small house in

Benbrook, on what is now San Saba Street; 145 John has testified that

it had a single bedroom, in which Lee slept with his mother, and a

screened porch where John and Robert slept.146 Mrs. Oswald worked at a

department store in Fort Worth, and left the three boys home alone.147

A neighbor, Mrs. W. H. Bell, has stated that Lee seemed to enjoy being

by himself and to resent discipline; 148 another neighbor, Otis R.

Carlton, stated that he once saw Lee chase John with a knife and throw

it at him, an incident which, Carlton said, their mother passed off as

a "little scuffle." 149 At the end of the summer, Carlton purchased

the property. He stated that he appraised it at $2,750 at Mrs.

Oswald's request; she then insisted that he had made an offer to

purchase at that price, which he finally agreed to do.150

</p><p>After the house was sold, the family returned to Fort Worth, a

move necessitated by Mrs. Oswald's, and now John's, employment.151

Mrs. Oswald bought a two-bedroom, frame house at 7408 Ewing, from

which Robert and Lee could walk to school.152 John, who was then 16,

obtained a job as a shoe stockboy at Everybody's Department Store; he

testified that he wanted to finish high school at the military

academy, but that his mother advised him to leave school and help to

support the family.153 He gave her $15 per week out of his salary of

$25.154 Robert returned to school.155

</p><p>Lee entered the third grade at the Arlington Heights Elementary

School.156 He remained at Arlington Heights for the entire school

year, completing the third grade with a satisfactory record, which

included A's in social studies, citizenship, elementary science, art,

and music, and a D in spelling. 157 In September 1949, he transferred

to the Ridglea West Elementary School, where he remained for the next

3 years.158 Lee's record at Ridglea is not remarkable in any respect.

In the fourth and fifth grades, he received mostly B's; in the sixth

grade, B's and C's predominate.159 He received D's in

</p><p><strong>Page 675</strong>

</p><p>both the fifth and sixth grades in spelling and arithmetic; in the

fourth and sixth grades, C's are recorded for Spanish,160 which may

account for his rudimentary familiarity with that language later on.

161 In the fourth grade his IQ was recorded at 103; on achievement

tests in each of the 3 years, he twice did best in reading and twice

did worst in spelling.162

</p><p>Lee is generally characterized as an unexceptional but rather

solitary boy during these years. His mother worked in a variety of

jobs,163 and, according to her own testimony, told Lee not to contact

her at work except in an emergency. 164  He ordinarily returned home

alone directly after school, in obedience to his mother's

instructions.165 A fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Clyde I. Livingston,

described him as a lonely boy, quiet and shy, who did not easily form

friendships with other students.166 But Richard W. Garrett has stated

that he was a classmate of Lee in the fourth or fifth grade and found

him easy to get along with; he recalled playing with Lee often at

school and sometimes walking home together with him.167 Mrs.

Livingston recalled that at Christmas 1949, Lee gave her a puppy and

afterward came to her home to see the puppy and talk to her and her

family.168

</p><p>Lee's relationship with his brothers was good but limited by the

difference in their ages.169 He still had a dog,170 but there were few

children of his age in the neighborhood, and he appears to have been

by himself after school most of the time. 171  He read a lot,172 had a

stamp collection, and played chess and Monopoly with his brothers.173

Mrs. Murret remembered that on a visit to her home in New Orleans, Lee

refused to play with other children or even to leave the house; he

preferred to stay indoors and read (mostly "funnybooks") or listen to

the radio. 174  After several weeks with the Murrets, Lee wrote to his

mother and asked her to come for him.175 Hiram Conway, a neighbor on

Ewing Street, thought Lee was an intelligent child, who picked things

up easily; although he did not recall many specific incidents to

support his impressions, Conway regarded Lee as "a bad kid," who was

"quick to anger" and "mean when he was angry, just ornery." 176 John's

general picture of Lee in these years is that of "a normal healthy

robust boy who would get in fights and still have his serious

moments." 177

</p><p>John returned to high school in January 1949, but continued to

work part time. 178 Early in 1950, he entered the Coast Guard.179

Robert left school soon after John's departure and went to work full

time, contributing most of his earnings to the support of his family.

180 He returned to school in 1951-52, and after completing his junior

year in high school, joined the Marines in July 1952. 181  In August,

Mrs. Oswald and Lee moved to New York, where John was living with his

wife and a very young baby in an apartment at 325 East 92d Street; the

apartment belonged to John's mother-in-law, who was temporarily

away.182 Mrs. Oswald has explained that with Robert gone she did not

want Lee to be alone while she worked and that she went to New York

City "not as a venture," but because she "had family" there.183

</p><p><strong>Page 676</strong>

</p><p>The visit began well. John testified of his meeting with Lee: "We

met in the street and I was real glad to see him and he was real glad

to see me. We were real good friends." 184 He took about a week of

leave and showed Lee the city; he remembered trips to the Museum of

Natural History and Polk's Hobby Shop, and a ride on the Staten Island

ferry.185 But when it became obvious that his mother intended to stay,

the atmosphere changed. Mrs. Oswald did not get along with John's

wife, with whom she quarreled frequently.186 There was difficulty

about her failure to contribute anything towards her own and Lee's

support.187 According to John, his wife liked Lee and would have been

glad to have him alone stay with them but felt that his mother set Lee

against her; they never suggested that Lee remain with them since they

knew that it would not work out.188 The visit ended when Lee

threatened Mrs. Pic with a pocket knife during a quarrel,189 and she

asked Mrs. Oswald to leave.190 John testified that during this same

quarrel Lee hit his mother, who appeared to have lost all control over

him.191 The incident permanently destroyed the good relationship

between Lee and his brother.192

</p><p>Mrs. Oswald and Lee moved uptown to a one-room basement apartment

193 in the Bronx, at 1455 Sheridan Avenue.194 While they were still at

the Pics, he had been enrolled at the Trinity Evangelical Lutheran

School on Watson Avenue.195 He was withdrawn on September 26, after

several weeks of irregular attendance, and 4 days later enrolled in

the seventh grade of Public School 117, a junior high school.196 Mrs.

Oswald found a job at one of the Lerner Shops, a chain of dress shops

for which she had worked briefly in Fort Worth several years

before.197 In January, they moved again, to 825 East 179th Street,198

and a few weeks later, she left the employ of Lerner Shops.199 In

April, she was working at Martin's Department Store in Brooklyn, where

she earned $45 per week;200 in May, she went to work for a chain of

hosiery shops, with which she remained until December.201 Lee was

registered at Public School 117 until January 16, 1953,202 although

the move to 179th Street, which took him out of that school district,

probably took place before that date.203 He had been at Public School

117 for 64 schooldays, out of which he had been present on 15 full and

2 half days;204 he had received failing grades in most of his

courses.205

</p><p>Lee's truancy increased after he moved; he was now located in the

school district of Public School 44 but refused to go to school

there.206 On one occasion that spring, an attendance officer located

Lee at the Bronx Zoo; the officer testified that Lee was clean and

well dressed, but was surly and referred to the officer as a "damned

Yankee." 207 Several truancy hearings were held in January, at the

first of which at least, both Mrs. Oswald and Lee evidently failed to

appear.208 At a hearing on January 27, by which time it was known that

Lee was living in the Public School 44 district, it was decided to

commence judicial proceedings if his truancy continued.209 Meanwhile,

on January 16, his mother called the Community Service Society, to

which she had

</p><p><strong>Page 677</strong>

</p><p>been referred by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, and

asked for an appointment to discuss the problem.210 She mentioned that

a truancy hearing had been held and said that Lee would not attend

school despite the threat of official action; she thought that his

behavior was due to difficulty in adjusting to his new environment.211

An appointment was scheduled for January 30, but she failed to appear,

and the case was closed.212 Sometime in February, the Pics visited the

Oswalds. John testified that his mother told him about Lee's truancy

and asked how she could get Lee to accept psychiatric aid. Nothing

came of these discussions.213

</p><p>On March 12, the attendance officer in charge of Lee's case filed

a petition in court which alleged that Lee had been "excessively

absent from school" between October and January, that he had refused

to register at Public School 44 or to attend school there, and that he

was "beyond the control of his mother insofar as school attendance is

concerned? 214 On the same day, Mrs. Oswald appeared in court alone

and informed the presiding judge that Lee refused to appear in

court.215 Evidently impressed by the proceedings, however, Lee did

register at Public School 44 on March 23.216 Nevertheless, on April

16, Justice Delany declared him a truant, and remanded him to Youth

House until May 7 for psychiatric study.217  

</p><p>In accordance with the regular procedures at Youth House, Lee took

a series of tests and was interviewed by a staff social worker and a

probation officer, both of whom interviewed Mrs. Oswald as well.218

Their findings, discussed more fully in chapter VII of the

Commission's report, indicated that Lee was a withdrawn, socially

maladjusted boy, whose mother did not interest herself sufficiently in

his welfare and had failed to establish a close relationship with

him.219 Mrs. Oswald visited Lee at Youth House and came away with a

highly unfavorable impression; she regarded it as unfit for her

son.220 On the basis of all the test results and reports and his own

interview with Lee, Dr. Renatus Hartogs, the chief staff psychiatrist,

recommended that Lee be placed on probation with a requirement that he

seek help from a child guidance clinic, and that his mother be urged

to contact a family agency for help; he recommended that Lee not be

placed in an institution unless treatment during probation was

unsuccessful.221

</p><p>Lee returned to court on May 7. He and his mother appeared before

Justice McClancy, who discussed the Youth House reports with them.222

He released Lee on parole until September 24, and requested that a

referral be made to the Community Service Society for treatment.223

The probation officer called the society on the same day but was told

that it would probably not be able to take the case because of its

already full case load and the intensive treatment which Lee was

likely to require; 224 it confirmed this position 1 week later and

closed the case on May 31.225 An application was made to the Salvation

Army also, which turned it down because it could not provide the

needed services.226

</p><p><strong>Page 678</strong>

</p><p>During the few weeks of school which remained, Lee attended school

regularly, and completed the seventh grade with low but passing marks

in all his academic subjects.227 (He received a failing mark in a home

economics course.)228 His conduct was generally satisfactory and he

was rated outstanding in "Social-Participation"; the record indicates

that he belonged to a model airplane club and had a special interest

in horseback riding.229 Robert Oswald visited New York that summer,

while he was on leave from the Marines.230 Lee did not appear to him

to be unhappy or to be acting abnormally, nor did Robert observe that

relations between Lee and his mother were strained.231 Lee's truancy

the previous fall and winter was apparently discussed only in passing,

when Mrs. Oswald mentioned that Lee had to appear before a

judge.232

</p><p>On September 14, Lee entered the eighth grade at Public School

44.233 His parole was due to end 10 days later. On September 24,

however, Mrs. Oswald telephoned the probation officer and advised that

she could not appear in court; she added that there was no need for

her to do so, since Lee was attending school regularly and was now

well adjusted.234 The parole was extended until October 29, before

which date the school was to submit a progress report.235 The report

was highly unfavorable. Although Lee was attending school regularly,

his conduct was unsatisfactory; teachers reported that he refused to

salute the flag, did little work, and seemed to spend most of his time

"sailing paper planes around the room." 236 On October 29, Mrs. Oswald

again telephoned to say that she would be unable to appear. Justice

Sicher continued Lee's parole until November 19 and directed the

probation officer to make a referral to the Berkshire Industrial Farm

or Children's Village.237

</p><p>Before the next hearing, Mrs. Oswald discussed Lee's behavior with

the school authorities, who indicated to the probation officer that

Lee's behavior improved considerably after her visit to the school.238

He did, in fact, receive passing grades in most of his subjects in the

first marking period. His report also contains notations by his

teachers that he was "quick-tempered," "constantly losing control,"

and "getting into battles with others.239 Both Lee and his mother

appeared in court on November 19. Despite Mrs. Oswald's request that

Lee be discharged, Justice Sicher stated his belief that Lee needed

treatment, and continued his parole until January 28, 1954; the

probation officer was directed to contact the Big Brothers counseling

service in the meantime.240

</p><p>At the request of the probation officer, the Big Brothers office

contacted Mrs. Oswald in December, and on January 4 a caseworker

visited her and Lee at home.241 The caseworker reported that he was

cordially received but was told by Mrs. Oswald that continued

counseling was unnecessary; she pointed out to him that Lee now

belonged to the West Side YMCA, which he attended every Saturday. The

caseworker reported, however, that Lee was plainly "displeased with

the idea of being forced to join various 'Y' organizations about which

he cared little." Mrs. Oswald declared her intention to return to New

</p><p><strong>Page 679</strong>

</p><p>Orleans and was advised to obtain Lee's release from the court's

jurisdiction before she left.242 On the following day, she called the

probation officer, who was away on vacation, and was advised by his

office again not to take Lee out of the jurisdiction without the

court's consent.243 The same advice was repeated to her by the Big

Brothers caseworker on January 6.244 Through all these contacts, Mrs.

Oswald had evidenced reluctance to bring Lee into court, prompted

probably by fear that he would be retained in some sort of custody as

he had been at the time of the commitment to Youth House.245 Without

further communication to the court, Mrs. Oswald and Lee returned to

New Orleans sometime before January 10.246 On March 11, the court

dismissed the case.247

</p><p>In New Orleans, Lee and his mother stayed with the Murrets at 757

French Street while they looked for an apartment.248 Lee enrolled in

the eighth grade at Beauregard Junior High School on January 13 249

and completed the school year without apparent difficulty.250 He

entered the ninth grade in September and again received mediocre but

acceptable marks.251 In October 1954, Lee took a series of achievement

tests, on which he did well in reading and vocabulary, badly in

mathematics.252 At the end of the school year, on June 2, 1955, he

filled out a "personal history." He indicated that the subjects which

he liked best were civics, science, and mathematics; those he liked

least were English and art. His vocational preferences were listed as

biology and mechanical drawing; his plans after high school, however,

were noted as "military service" and "undecided." He said that reading

and outdoor sports were his recreational activities and that he liked

football in particular. In response to the question whether he had

"any close friends in this school," he wrote,"no." 253

</p><p>Lee is remembered by those who knew him in New Orleans as a

quiet., solitary boy who made few friends.254 He was briefly a member

of the Civil Air Patrol,255 and considered joining an organization of

high school students interested in astronomy; 256 occasionally, he

played pool or darts with his friend, Edward Voebel.257 Beyond this,

he seems to have had few contacts with other people. He read a lot,

starting at some point to read Communist literature which he found at

the public library; 258 he walked or rode a bicycle, sometimes

visiting a museum.259 Except in his relations with his mother, he was

not unusually argumentative or belligerent, but he seems not to have

avoided fights if they came; they did come fairly frequently, perhaps

in part because of his aloofness from his fellows and the traces of a

northern accent in his speech.260 His only close friendship, with

Voebel, arose when Voebel helped him tend his wounds after a fight.261

Friends of Mrs. Oswald thought that he was demanding and insolent

toward her and that she had no control over him.262

</p><p>While Lee was in the eighth and ninth grades, Mrs. Oswald worked

first at Burt's Shoestore 263 and then at the Dolly Shoe Co.264 One of

her employers at Dolly, where she worked as a cashier and salesclerk,

remembered her as a pleasant person and a good worker.265 At her

request, the company hired Lee to work part time; he worked there,

</p><p><strong>Page 680</strong>

</p><p>mostly on Saturdays, for about 10 weeks in 1955.266 On the "personal

history" record which he filled out in school, he stated that he had

been a "retail shoesaleman"; 267 but his employer recalled that they

had tried to train him as a salesman without success and that he had

in fact, been a stockboy.268

</p><p>After a short period with the Murrets, Mrs. Oswald and Lee had

moved to an apartment owned by Myrtle Evans at 1454 Saint Mary

Street, which she and Mrs. Murret helped to furnish; later they moved

to a less expensive apartment in the same building, the address of

which was 1452 Saint Mary Street.269 Relations between Mrs. Oswald and

Mrs. Evans became strained,270 and in the spring of 1955 the Oswalds

moved to a new apartment at 126 Exchange Place in the French

Quarter.271 Although Lee gave the Exchange Place address on a school

form at the end of the ninth grade,272 the school authorities had

apparently not been advised of these moves earlier, because Mrs.

Oswald did not want Lee to be transferred from Beauregard, which she

considered a good school.273 During the summer of 1955, Robert left

the Marine Corps and spent a week with his mother and Lee in New

Orleans before moving to Fort Worth; he found Lee unchanged.274

</p><p>That fall, Lee entered the 10th grade at Warren Easton High

School.275 He had been there for about a month when he presented to

the school authorities a note written by himself to which he had

signed his mother's name. It was dated October 7, 1955, and read:</p>

<blockquote>To whom it may concern,

<br><br>Becaus we are moving to San Diego in the middle of this month Lee

must quit school now. Also, please send by him any papers such as his

birth certificate that you may have. Thank you.
<br><br>
Sincirely<br><br>

 Mrs. M. Oswald 276</blockquote>
 
<p>
 He dropped out of school a few days later, shortly before his 16th

birthday.277 After his birthday, he tried to enlist in the Marines,

using a false affidavit from his mother that he was 17.278 (Some years

before, John Pic had joined the Marine Corps Reserve by means of his

mother's false affidavit that he was 17.) 279 The attempt failed, and,

according to his mother's testimony, Lee spent the next year reading

and memorizing the "Marine Manual," which he had obtained from Robert

and "living to when he is age 17 to join the Marines."

</p><p>He worked for the rest of the school year. Between November 10 and

January 14, he was a messenger boy for Gerald F. Tujague, Inc., a

shipping company, where he earned $130 per month.281 His employer

remembers him as a quiet, withdrawn person.282 In January he worked

briefly as an office boy for J. R. Michels, Inc.283 For several months

thereafter, he was a messenger for the Pfisterer Dental Laboratory.284

His military record subsequently described his prior civilian jobs as

follows:

</p> <strong>Page 681</strong>

	<blockquote>Performed  various  clerical duties such as distributing mail,

delivering messages &amp; answering telephone. Helped file records &amp;

operated ditto, letter opening &amp; sealing machines.285</blockquote>


<p>
Anticipating that Lee would join the Marines as soon as he was 17,

Mrs. Oswald moved in July 1956 to Fort Worth,286 where she took an

apartment at 4936 Collinswood for herself, Lee, and Robert.287 In

September, Lee enrolled in the 10th grade at the Arlington Heights

High School 288 but attended classes for only a few weeks. He dropped

out of school on September 28. 289 A few days later, he wrote the

following letter to the Socialist Party of America:</p>

    <blockquote>October 3, 1956

   <br><br>Dear Sirs;

    <br><br>I am sixteen years of age and would like more information about

your youth League, I would like to know if there is a branch in my

area, how to join, ect., I am a Marxist, and have been studying

socialist principles for well over fifteen months I am very interested

in your Y.P.S.L.

    <br><br>Sincerely

    <br><br>/s/ Lee Oswald 290</blockquote>
<p>
 Accompanying the letter was an advertisement coupon, on which he

had checked the box requesting information about the Socialist

Party.291

</p><p>Lee became 17 on October 18. He enlisted in the Marines on October

24.292</p>

 <strong>MARINES</strong>

 <p>On October 26, 1956, Lee Harvey Oswald reported for duty at the

Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego, Calif., where he was assigned

to the Second Recruit Training Battalion.293 He was 68 inches tall and

weighed 135 pounds; he had no physical defects.294 On October 30, he

took a series of aptitude tests, on which he scored significantly

above the Marine Corps average in reading and vocabulary and

significantly below the average in tests in arithmetic and pattern

analysis. His composite general classification score was 105, 2 points

below the Corps average. He scored near the bottom of the lowest group

in a radio code test.295 His preference of duty was recorded as

Aircraft Maintenance and Repair, the duty assignment for which he was

recommended.296

</p><p>While he was at San Diego, Oswald was trained in the use of the

M-1 rifle.297 His practice scores were not very good,298 but when his

company fired for record on December 21, he scored 212, 2 points above

the score necessary to qualify as a "sharpshooter" on a

marksman/sharpshooter/expert scale.299 He did not do nearly as well

when

</p><p><strong>Page 682</strong>

</p><p>he fired for record again shortly before he left the Marines.300 He

practiced also with a riot gun and a .45-caliber pistol when he was

in the Marines but no scores were recorded.301

</p><p>Oswald was given a 4.4 rating in both "conduct" and "proficiency"

at the Recruit Depot, the highest possible rating being 5.0 and an

average rating of 4.0 being required for an honorable discharge.302 On

January 18, 1957, he reported to Camp Pendleton, Calif., for further

training and was assigned to "A" Company of the First Battalion,

Second Infantry Training Regiment.303 He was at Pendleton for a little

more than 5 weeks, at the end of which he was rated 4.2 in conduct and

4.0 in proficiency.304 Allen R. Felde, a fellow recruit who was with


Oswald at San Diego and Pendleton, has stated that Oswald was

generally unpopular and that his company was avoided by the other

men.305 When his squad was given its first weekend leave from

Pendleton, all eight men took a cab to Tijuana, Mexico. Oswald left

the others and did not rejoin them until it was time to return to

camp. Felde said that this practice was repeated on other trips to Los

Angeles; Oswald accompanied the men on the bus to and from camp but

did not stay with them in the city.306 On February 27, he went on

leave for 2 weeks,307 during which he may have visited his mother in

Fort Worth.308

</p><p>On March 18, he reported to the Naval Air Technical Training

Center at the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Fla.309 For the next

6 weeks he attended an Aviation Fundamental School, in which he

received basic instruction in his specialty, including such subjects

as basic radar theory, map reading, and air traffic control

procedures.310 This course, as well as his next training assignment at

Keesler Air Force Base, required Oswald to deal with confidential

material.311 He was granted final clearance up to the "confidential"

level on May 3, "after [a] careful check of local records had

disclosed no derogatory data." 312 He completed the course on the same

day, ranking 46th in a class of 54 students.313 On the previous day,

he had been promoted to private, first class, effective May 1.314 At

Jacksonville, he received ratings of 4.7 in conduct and 4.5 in

proficiency, the highest ratings he ever attained.315

</p><p>Oswald left for Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss., on the

day his course was completed; 316 he traveled, probably by overnight

train, in a group of six marines led by Pfc. Daniel P. Powers, the

senior marine in charge.317 At Keesler, he attended the Aircraft

Control and Warning Operator Course, which included instruction in

aircraft surveillance and the use of radar.318 Powers was not sure

whether he had met Oswald before the trip to Biloxi 319 but remembers

him there as "a somewhat younger individual less matured than the

other boys," who "was normally outside the particular group of marines

that were in this attachment to Keesler." 320 (Oswald was in fact 3



years younger than Powers.) 321 Powers testified that Oswald had the

nickname "Ozzie Rabbit." 322 Oswald generally stayed to himself, often

read-

</p><p><strong>Page 683</strong>

</p><p>ing; he did not play cards or work out in the gym with the others.323

He spent his weekends alone, away from the base; Powers thought he

left Biloxi and perhaps went "home" to New Orleans, less than 100

miles away.324 He finished the course seventh in a class of 30 marines

on June 17,325 and on June 25, was given an MOS (military occupational

specialty) of Aviation Electronics Operator.326 On June 20, he went on

leave,327 possibly visiting his mother.328 His ratings at Keesler were

4.2 in conduct. and 4.5 in proficiency,329 which Powers thought was

"pretty good." 330

</p><p>On July 9, Oswald reported at the Marine Corps Air Station at El

Toro, Calif., near Santa Ana.331 He was classified as a replacement

trainee and attached to the Fourth Replacement Battalion.332 Six weeks

later, on August 22, he departed from San Diego for Yokosuka, Japan,

on board the U.S.S. Bexar.333 Powers testified that while on board,

Oswald taught him to play chess, which they played frequently,

sometimes for more than 4 hours a day.334 Like most of the men on

board, Oswald read a lot from the books which were available. Powers

thought he read "a good type of literature," remembering in particular

Whitman's "Leaves of Grass." 335

</p><p>The Bexar docked at Yokosuka on September 12.336 Oswald was

assigned to Marine Air Control Squadron No. 1 (MACS-1), Marine Air

Group 11, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, based at Atsugi, about 20 miles

west of Tokyo.337 Oswald was a radar operator in MACS-1, which had

less than 100 men.338 Its function was to direct aircraft to their

targets by radar, communicating with the pilots by radio.339 The

squadron had also the duty of scouting for incoming foreign aircraft,

such as straying Russian or Chinese planes, which would be intercepted

by American planes.340

</p><p>On October 27, when Oswald opened his locker to remove some gear,

a derringer .22 caliber pistol fell to the floor and discharged; the

bullet hit him in the left elbow.341 Paul Edward Murphy, a fellow

marine who was in the next cubicle, heard the shot, rushed in, and

found Oswald sitting on the locker looking at his arm; without

emotion, Oswald said to Murphy, "I believe I shot myself." 342 He was

in the naval hospital at Yokosuka until November 15.343

</p><p>The Judge Advocate General concluded that Oswald had "displayed a

certain degree of carelessness or negligence" by storing a loaded

revolver in his locker, but that his injury was incurred "in the line

of duty" and was not the result of his own misconduct." 344 He was,

however, charged with possession of an unregistered privately owned

weapon in violation of general orders. A court-martial followed on

April 11, 1958, when Oswald's unit returned from maneuvers, and on

April 29 he was sentenced to be confined at hard labor for 20 days, to

forfeit $25 per month for 2 months, and to be reduced to the grade of

private.345 The confinement was suspended for 6 months, after which

that portion of the sentence was to be remitted.346

</p><p>Five days after Oswald left the hospital, MACS-1 embarked aboard

the Terrell County, LST 1157, for maneuvers in the Philippine Islands

</p><p><strong>Page 684</strong>

</p><p>area.347 According to Powers' recollection, the squadron was expected

to return to Atsugi after maneuvers were completed, but an

international crisis developed; since another operation was scheduled

for a few months later, the squadron debarked at Cubi Point (Subic

Bay) in the Philippines and set up a temporary installation.348 While

he was in the Philippines, Oswald passed a test of eligibility for the

rank of corporal; 349 in a semiannual evaluation, however, he was

given his lowest ratings thus far: 4.0 in conduct and 3.9 in

proficiency.350 The unit participated in exercises at Corregidor, from

which it sailed for Atsugi on March 7, 1958, aboard the U.S.S. Wexford

County, LST 1168.351 The Wexford County reached Atsugi 11 days

later.352

</p><p>Oswald was court-martialed a second time on June 27, for using

"provoking words" to a noncommissioned officer (a sergeant) on June

20, at the Bluebird Cafe in Yamato, and assaulting the officer by

pouring a drink on him.353 The findings were that Oswald spilled the

drink accidentally, but when the sergeant shoved him away, Oswald

invited the sergeant outside in insulting language.354 Oswald admitted

that he was rather drunk and had invited the sergeant outside but did

not recall insulting him.355 He was sentenced to be confined at hard

labor for 28 days and to forfeit $55; 356 in addition, suspension of

the previous sentence of confinement was withdrawn.357 He was in

confinement until August 13.358 Meanwhile, a previously granted

extension of oversea duty was canceled,359 and he was given ratings of

1.9 in conduct and 3.4 in proficiency.360

</p><p>On September 14, Oswald sailed with his unit for the South China

Sea area; the unit was at Ping Tung, North Taiwan on September 30, and

returned to Atsugi on October 5.361 On October 6, he was transferred

out of MACS-1 and put on general duty, in anticipation of his return

to the United States.362 He spent several days thereafter in the

Atsugi Station Hospital.363 On October 31, he received his last

oversea ratings: 4.0 in both conduct and proficiency.364

</p><p>Oswald appears generally to have been regarded by his fellows

overseas as an intelligent person who followed orders and did his work

well, but who complained frequently.365 He did not associate much with

other marines and continued to read a great deal.366 Paul Murphy

testified that Oswald could speak "a little Russian" while he was

overseas.367 Powers believed that Oswald became more assertive in

Japan and thought that he might have had a Japanese girl friend.368 He

departed from Yokosuka on board the USNS Barbet on November 2, and

arrived in San Francisco 13 days later.369 On November 19, he took 30

days' leave.370

</p><p>On December 22, Oswald was assigned to Marine Air Control Squadron

No. 9 (MACS-9) at the Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro, where he

had been briefly before he went overseas.371 He was one of about seven

enlisted men and three officers who formed a "radar crew," engaged

primarily in aircraft surveillance.372 This work probably gave him

access to certain kinds of classified material, some of which, such as

aircraft call signs and radio frequencies, was

</p><p><strong>Page 685</strong>

</p><p>changed after his defection to Russia.373 For part of his time at El

Toro, Oswald may have been assigned to clerical or janitorial tasks on

the base.374 Some of his associates believed rumors,375 incorrect

according to official records,376 that he had lost his clearance to

work on radar crews; one recalled hearing that Oswald had once had

clearance above the "confidential" level and had lost it because he

"had poured beer over a staff NCO's head in an enlisted club in Japan,

and had been put in the brig." 377

</p><p>The officer in command of the radar crew, Lt. John E. Donovan,

found him "competent in all functions," and observed that he handled

himself calmly and well in emergency situations.378 Donovan thought

Oswald was not a leader but that he performed competently on occasions

when, as the senior man present, he served as crew chief.379 This

estimate was generally shared by his fellows, most of whom thought

that he performed his assigned duties adequately but was deficient in

disciplinary matters and such things as barracks inspection.380 One of

them recalled that after a number of bad inspections, the other

members of Oswald's quonset hut complained about him and secured his

transfer to another hut.381 He was thought to be an intelligent

person, somewhat better educated and more intellectually oriented than

other men on the base.382 A few of the men thought it more accurate to

describe him as someone who wanted to appear intelligent.383 He had a

pronounced interest in world affairs, in which he appears to have been

better informed than some of the officers, whose lack of knowledge

amused and sometimes irritated him; he evidently enjoyed drawing

others, especially officers, into conversations in which he could

display his own superior knowledge.384

</p><p>It seems clear from the various recollections of those who knew

him at El Toro that by the time Oswald returned to the United States,

he no longer had any spirit for the Marines; the attitudes which had

prompted his enlistment as soon as he was eligible were entirely gone,

and his attention had turned away from the Marines to what he might do

after his discharge. While no one was able to predict his attempt to

defect to Russia within a month after he left the Marines, the

testimony of those who knew him at El Toro in contrast to that of his

associates in Japan, leaves no doubt that his thoughts were occupied

increasingly with Russia and the Russian way of life. He had studied

the Russian language enough by February 25, 1959, to request that he

be given a foreign language qualification test; his rating was "poor"

in all parts of the test.385 Most of the marines who knew him were

aware that he was studying Russian; 386 one of them, Henry J. Roussel,

Jr., arranged a date between Lee and his aunt, Rosaleen Quinn, an

airline stewardess who was also studying Russian.387 (Miss Quinn

thought that Oswald spoke Russian well in view of his lack of formal

training; she found the evening uninteresting.388 Donovan, with whom

she had a date later, testified that she told him that Oswald was

"kind of an oddball.") 389 He read, and perhaps subscribed to, a

newspaper, possibly printed in Russian, which his associates connected

with his Russian bent.390

</p><p><strong>Page 686</strong>

</p><p>Most of those who knew him were able to recount anecdotes which

suggest that he was anxious to publicize his liking for things

Russian, sometimes in good humor and sometimes seriously. Some of his

fellows called him "Oswaldskovich," apparently to his pleasure.391 He

is said to have had his name written in Russian on one of his

jackets;392 to have played records of Russian songs "so loud that one

could hear them outside the barracks"; 393 frequently to have made

remarks in Russian 394 or used expressions like "da" or "nyet," 395 or

addressed others (and been addressed) as "Comrade";396 to have come

over and said jokingly, "You called?" when one of the marines played

a particular record of Russian music.397

</p><p>Connected with this Russophilia was an interest in and acceptance

of Russian political views and, to a lesser extent, Communist

ideology. Less obvious to his fellows generally,398 it nevertheless

led him into serious discussions with some of them. Donovan, who was a

graduate of the School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University,399

thought Oswald was "truly interested in international  

fairs" 400 and "very well versed, at least on the superficial facts of

a given foreign situation." 401 He recalled that Oswald had a

particular interest in Latin America 402 and had a good deal of

information about Cuba in particular.403 Oswald expressed sympathy for

Castro but, according to Donovan, "what he said about Castro was not

an unpopular belief at that time." 404 Donovan believed that Oswald

subscribed to the Russian newspaper--which Donovan thought was a

Communist newspaper--not only in order to read Russian but also

because he thought it "presented a very different and perhaps equally

just side of the international affairs in comparison with the United

States newspapers." 405 Donovan was clear, on the other hand, that he

never heard Oswald "in any way, shape or form confess that he was a

Communist, or that he ever thought about being a Communist." 406

</p><p>Private Kerry Thornley described himself as a close acquaintance,

but not a good friend, of Oswald, whom he met in the spring of 1959;

he later wrote an unpublished novel in which he drew heavily on his

impressions of Oswald.408 Thornley generally corroborates Donovan's

testimony but thought Oswald definitely believed that "the Marxist

morality was the most rational morality to follow" and communism, "the

best system in the world." 409 Thornley thought this belief was

"theoretical," a "dispassionate appraisal" which did not indicate "any

active commitment to the Communist ends"; he described Oswald as "idle

in his admiration for communism." 410 He recalled discussions about

Marxism in which Oswald criticized capitalism and praised the Soviet

economic system.411 Thornley testified that his association with

Oswald ended when, in response to Oswald's criticism of a parade in

which they both had to march, he said "Well, comes the revolution you

will change all that." Oswald, he said, looked at him "like a betrayed

Caesar" and walked away.412 Thornley attributed Oswald's decision to

go to Russia to a growing disillusionment with the United States,

especially its role in the Far East, and a conviction that communism

</p><p><strong>Page 687</strong>

</p><p>would eventually prevail.413 He was surprised by the decision but

expected Oswald to adjust to Russian life and remain in Russia

permanently

</p><p>Another marine, Nelson Delgado, met Oswald soon after the latter

arrived at El Toro.415 They were about the same age and had similar

interests; Oswald enjoyed trying to speak Spanish with Delgado, who

spoke it fluently.416 Delgado regarded him as a "complete believer

that our way of government was not quite right," but did not think he

was a Communist.417 Their discussions were concerned more with Cuba

than Russia.418 They both favored the Castro government and

talked--"dreaming," Delgado said--about joining the Cuban Army or

Government and perhaps leading expeditions to other Caribbean islands

to "free them too." 419 Oswald told Delgado that he was in touch with

Cuban diplomatic officials in this count; which Delgado at first,

took to be "one of his ... lies," 420 but later believed.421

</p><p>Oswald's interest in Russia and developing ideological attachment

to theoretical communism apparently dominated his stay at El Toro. He

was still withdrawn from most of his fellows, although his special

interests appear to have made him stand out more there than he had at

other posts and to have given him a source for conversation which he

had hitherto lacked.422 According to several of the witnesses, names

like "Ozzie Rabbit" still clung to him; 423 others recalled no

nickname or only shortened versions of his real name.424 His reading

acquired direction; books like "Das Kapital" and Orwell's "Animal

Farm" and "1984" are mentioned in the testimony concerning this

period.  He played chess; 426 according to one of his opponents he chose the red

pieces, expressing a preference for the "Red Army." 427 He listened to

classical music.428 For a short time, he played on the squadron

football team.429 According to Donovan, who coached the team, Oswald

was not very good; he lacked team spirit and often tried to call the

plays, which was not his job.430 Delgado thought Oswald was a mediocre

player.431 Donovan did not know whether Oswald quit or was thrown off

the team.432 He spent most of his weekends alone, as he had at

Keesler, and did not leave the post as often as the other men.433

Delgado once rode with him on the train to Los Angeles but separated

from him there; Oswald returned to the base after one night.434

Delgado recalls that on another weekend Oswald accepted his

invitation to go to Tijuana; they stayed there for one night.435

</p><p>At the end of January 1959 and at the end of July, Oswald was

given his semiannual ratings, scoring 4.0 in conduct both times, and

4.0 and 4.2 in proficiency.436 (The July ratings were repeated in

September, when he was transferred from MACS-9 in preparation for his

discharge.)437 On March 9, he was promoted as of March 1, to the rank

of private, first class, for the second time.438 He took a series of

high school level general educational development tests on March 23

and received an overall rating of "satisfactory." His best scores, in

the 76th and 79th U.S. percentiles, were in English composition and

physical sciences; his worst was English literature, in which he

placed in the 34th percentile.439

</p><p><strong>Page 688</strong>

</p><p>In the spring, Oswald applied to Albert Schweitzer College in

Churwalden, Switzerland, for admission to the spring term in 1960; the

application is dated March 19.440 Schweitzer is a small school, which

specializes in courses in religion, ethics, science, and literature.

He claimed a proficiency in Russian equal to 1 year of schooling

and that he had completed high school by correspondence with an

average grade of 85 percent.442 He listed philosophy, psychology,

ideology, football, baseball, tennis and stamp-collecting as special

interests, and writing short stories "on contemporary American life"

as his vocational interest.443 Jack London, Charles Darwin, and Norman

Vincent Peale were listed as favorite authors.444 He claimed

membership in the YMCA and the "A.Y.H. Association," and said that he

had participated in a "student body movement in school" for the

control of juvenile delinquency.445 Asked to give a general statement

of his reasons for wanting to attend the college, he wrote:</p>

    <blockquote>In order to aquire a fuller understanding of that subject which

interest me most, Philosophy. To meet with Europeans who can broaden

my scope of understanding. To receive formal Education by Instructers

of high standing and character. To broaden my knowlege of German and

to live in a healty climate and Good moral atmosphere.446</blockquote>


<p>
On the basis of these representations, Oswald's application was

approved by the college.447 He enclosed a registration fee of $25 in

a letter dated June 19, in which he said that he was "looking forward

to a fine stay." 448 Few of the other marines seem to have known about

this application. He told Delgado, however, that he planned to attend

a Swiss school to study psychology, and Delgado knew that some

application had been made.449  Another marine, Richard Call, also knew

something of his plans.450

</p><p>Oswald was obligated to serve on active duty until December 7,

1959 (the date having been adjusted to compensate for the period of

confinement).451 On August 17, he submitted a request for a dependency

discharge, on the ground that his mother needed his support.452 The

request was accompanied by an affidavit of Mrs. Oswald and

corroborating affidavits from an attorney, a doctor, and two friends,

attesting that she had been injured at work in December 1958, and was

unable to support herself.453 Oswald had previously made a voluntary

allotment of part of his salary to his mother, under which arrangement

she received $40 in August, and had submitted an application for a "Q"

allotment (dependency allowance) in her behalf of $91.30; one payment

of the "Q" allotment, for the month of August, was made in

September.454 On August 28, the Wing Hardship or Dependency Discharge

Board recommended that Oswald's request for a discharge be approved;

455 approval followed shortly.456 On September 4, he was transferred

from MACS-9 to the H. &amp; H. Squadron,457 and on September 11, he was

released from active duty and transferred to the Marine Corps Reserve,

in which he was expected to

</p><p><strong>Page 689</strong>

</p><p>serve until December 8, 1962.458 He was assigned to the Marine Air

Reserve Training Command at the Naval Air Station in Glenview, Ill.459

</p><p>Almost exactly 1 year later, on September 13, 1960, Oswald was

given an "undesirable discharge" from the Marine Corps Reserve,460

based on:</p>

    <blockquote>reliable information which indicated that he had renounced his U.S.

citizenship with the intentions of becoming a permanent citizen of the

Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Further, that petitioner brought

discredit to the Marine Corps through adverse newspaper publicity,

which was generated by the foregoing action, and had thereby, in the

opinion of his commanding officer, proved himself unfit for retention

in the naval service.461</blockquote>

<strong>SOVIET UNION</strong>

 <p>On September 4, the day on which he was transferred out of MACS-9

in preparation for his discharge, Oswald had applied for a passport

at the Superior Court of Santa Ana, Calif. His application stated

that he planned to leave the United States on September 21 to attend

the Albert Schweitzer College and the University of Turku in Finland,

and to travel in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, England, France

Germany, and Russia.462 The passport was routinely issued 6 days

later.463

</p><p>Oswald went directly home after his discharge, and arrived in Fort

Worth by September 14.464 He told his mother that he intended to get a

job on a ship or possibly in the "export-import business." 465 If he

stayed in Fort Worth, he said, he would be able to earn only about $30

per week; on a ship, he would earn "big money" and be able to send

substantial amounts home.466 Three days after he arrived in Fort

Worth, he left for New Orleans.467 While he was in Fort Worth he had

registered his dependency discharge and entry into the Marine Reserve

at the Fort Worth Selective Service Board,468 and visited his brother

Robert and his family.469 He also gave his mother $100.470

</p><p>On September 17, Oswald spoke with a representative of Travel

Consultants, Inc., a New Orleans travel bureau; he filled out a

"Passenger Immigration Questionnaire," on which he gave his occupation

as "shipping export agent" and said that he would be abroad for 2

months on a pleasure trip. He booked passage from New Orleans to Le

Havre, France, on a freighter, the SS Marion Lykes, scheduled to sail

on September 18, for which he paid $220.75.471 On the evening of

September 17, he registered at the Liberty Hotel.472

</p><p>The Marion Lykes did not sail until the early morning of September

20.473 Before its departure, Oswald wrote his mother a letter, which

was her last news of him until she read stories of his defection in

Fort Worth newspapers:

</p><p><strong>Page 690</strong></p>

    <blockquote>Dear Mother:

 <p>Well, I have booked passage on a ship to Europe, I would of had

to sooner or later and I think it's best I go now. Just remember above

all else that my values are very different from Robert's or your's. It

is difficult to tell you how I feel, Just remember this is what I must

do. I did not tell you about my plans because you could harly be

expected to understand.

<br><br>I did not see aunt Lilian while I was here. I will write again as

soon as I land.<br><br>

			 Lee 474</p></blockquote>

				
<p>
The Marion Lykes carried only four passengers.475 Oswald shared

his cabin with Billy Joe Lord, a young man who had just graduated from

high school and was going to France to continue his education. Lord

testified that he and Oswald did not discuss politics but did have a

few amicable religious arguments, in which Oswald defended atheism.

Oswald was "standoffish," but told Lord generally about his

background, mentioning that his mother worked in a drugstore in Fort

Worth and that he was bitter about the low wages which she received.

He told Lord that he intended to travel in Europe and possibly to

attend school in Sweden or Switzerland if he had sufficient funds.476

The other two passengers were Lt. Col. and Mrs. George B. Church, Jr.,

who also found Oswald unfriendly and had little contact with him.

Oswald told them that he had not liked the Marine Corps and that he

planned to study in Switzerland; they observed some "bitterness" about

his mother's difficulties, but did not discuss this with him. No one

on board suspected that he intended to defect to Russia.477

</p><p>Oswald disembarked at Le Havre on October 8. He left for England

that same day, and arrived on October 9.478 He told English customs

officials in Southampton that he had $700 and planned to remain in the

United Kingdom for 1 week before proceeding to a school in

Switzerland. But on the same day, he flew to Helsinki, Finland, where

he registered at the Torni Hotel; on the following day, he moved to

the Klaus Kurki Hotel.479

</p><p>Oswald probably applied for a visa at the Russian consulate on

October 12, his first business day in Helsinki.480 The visa was issued

on October 14. It was valid until October 20 and permitted him to take

one trip of not more than 6 days to the Soviet Union.481 He also

purchased 10 Soviet "tourist vouchers" which cost $30 apiece.482 He

left Helsinki by train on the following day, crossed the

Finnish-Russian border at Vainikkala, and arrived in Moscow on October

16.483

</p><p>He was met at the Moscow railroad station by a representative of

"Intourist," the state tourist agency, and taken to the Hotel Berlin,

where he registered as a student.484 On the same day he met the

Intourist guide assigned to him during his stay in Russia, a young

woman named Rima Shirokova. They went sightseeing the next day. Almost

immediately he told her that he wanted to leave

</p><p><strong>Page 691</strong>

</p><p>the United States and become a citizen of the Soviet Union. According

to Oswald's "Historic Diary," she later told him that she had reported

his statement to Intourist headquarters, which in turn had notified

the "Passport and Visa Office" (probably the Visa and Registration

Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the MVD 485). She was

instructed to help Oswald prepare a letter to the Supreme Soviet

requesting that he be granted citizenship. Oswald mailed such a letter

that same day.486 (The "Historic Diary" is Oswald's handwritten

account of his life in Russia.487 The earlier entries were written

after the events which they describe; later, in Minsk, he probably

kept a contemporaneous record of his experiences. 488 The Commission

has used the diary, which Oswald may have written with future readers

in mind, only as Oswald's record of his private life and personal

impressions as he sought to present them and has relied wherever

possible on official documents, correspondence, and the testimony of

witnesses.)

</p><p>The diary records that when Oswald told Rima Shirokova that he

intended to defect she was "flabbergassted," but agreed to help.489

She was "politly sympathetic but uneasy" when he told her that he

wanted to defect because he was "a Communist, ect." 490 As an

Intourist guide, Rima toured parts of Moscow with Oswald in the next

few days. His primary concern, however, appeared to be his effort to

become a Soviet citizen, and she also aided him in his dealings with

the Soviet Government.491 He thought that Rima felt sorry for him and

tried to be a friend because he was "someth. new." 492 On his 20th

birthday, 2 days after he arrived in Russia, she gave him Dostoevski's

"The Idiot," 493 in which she had written: "Dear Lee, Great

congratulations! Let all your dreams come true! 18.X 1959" 494

</p><p>On October 19, Oswald was probably interviewed in his hotel room

by a man named Lev Setyayev, who said that he was a reporter for Radio

Moscow seeking statements from American tourists about their

impressions of Moscow,495 but who was probably also acting for the

KGB.496 Two years later, Oswald told officials at the American Embassy

that he had made a few routine comments to Setyayev of no political

signifiance. The interview with Setyayev may, however, have been the

occasion for an attempt by the KGB, in accordance with regular

practice, to assess Oswald or even to elicit compromising statements

from him; the interview was apparently never broadcast.497 (As

discussed in ch. VI of this report, the Commission is aware that many

of the Soviet officials with whom Oswald came into contact were

employees of the KGB, the agency which has primary jurisdiction for

the treatment of defectors.)

</p><p>On the following day, Rima Shirokova told him that the "Pass. and

Visa Dept." wanted to see him,498 and on the morning of October 21, he

was interviewed by an official concerning his application for

citizenship. The official offered little information and no

encouragement; he told Oswald only that he would check to see if the

visa could

</p><p><strong>Page 692</strong>

</p><p>be extended. Oswald returned to the Hotel Berlin.499 That afternoon,

he was notified that his visa had expired and that he had to leave

Moscow within 2 hours.500

</p><p>Oswald responded to the unfavorable decision by cutting himself

above his left, wrist, in an apparent suicide attempt. Rima Shirokova

found him unconscious in his hotel room and had him taken to the

Botkinskaya Hospital. His diary states: "Poor Rimmea stays by my side

as interrpator (my Russian is still very bad) far into the night, I

tell her 'Go home' (my mood is bad) but she stays, she is 'my

friend.'" 501

</p><p>For 3 days Oswald was confined in the psychiatric ward of the

hospital. He was examined by a psychiatrist, who concluded that he was

not dangerous to other people and could be transferred to the

"somatic" department. Hospital records containing the results of the

examination 502 state that Oswald came to Russia in order to apply for

citizenship, and that "in order to postpone his departure he inflicted

the injury upon himself." 503 They note that Oswald understood some

Russian and, presumably based on information which he provided, that

he had "graduated from a technical high school in radio technology and

radio electronics." 504 The record states: "He claims he regrets his

action. After recovering he intends to return to his homeland." 505

</p><p>Oswald resented being in the psychiatric ward and told Rima

Shirokova that he wanted a transfer.506 She visited him at the

hospital frequently and his diary records that "only at this moment"

did he "notice [that] she is preety." 507 Another entry for the

hospital period says: "Afternoon I am visited by Roza Agafonova of the

hotel tourist office, who askes about my health, very beautiful,

excelant Eng., very merry and kind, she makes me very glad to be

alive." 508 These entries reflect an attitude gentler and friendlier

than his attitude before the suicide attempt, when he seemed to be

coldly concerned only with his status in Russia. Once Oswald was out

of the psychiatric ward, he found the hospital more pleasant. The new

ward, which he shared with 11 other patients, was "airy," and the food

was good. His only complaint, according to his diary, was that an

"elderly American" patient was distrustful of him because he had not

registered at the American Embassy and because he was evasive about

the reasons for his presence in Moscow and confinement in the

hospital.509

</p><p>He was released from the hospital on October 28,510 and,

accompanied by Rima Shirokova, was driven to the Hotel Berlin in an

Intourist car. After he said goodby to Lyudmila Dmitrieva, head of the

In-tourist office at the Berlin, and to Roza Agafonova, another

Intourist employee at the hotel, he checked out of the Berlin and

registered at the Metropole, 511 a large hotel under the same

administration as the Berlin.512 The Government had undoubtedly

directed him to make the change. His visa had expired while he was in

the hospital, and his presence in Russia was technically illegal; he

had received no word that the decision that he must leave had been

reversed. Later that day, however, Rima told him that the "Pass and

Registration Office" wished

</p><p><strong>Page 693</strong>

</p><p>to talk to him about his future.513 According to the diary, when

Oswald appeared at the office he was asked whether he still wanted to

become a Soviet citizen and he replied that he did; he provided his

Marine Corps discharge papers for identification. He was told that he

could not expect a decision soon, and was dismissed. During this

interview, Oswald was apparently questioned about the interview which

preceded his hospitalization, which led him to conclude that there had

been no communication between the two sets of officials.514 That

evening he met Rima, on whom he vented his frustration at being put

off by the authorities.515

</p><p>Oswald ate only once on the following day; he stayed near the

telephone, fully dressed and ready to leave immediately if he were

summoned. He remained in his room for 3 days, which seemed to him

"like three years," 516 until October 31, when he decided to act. He

met Rima Shirokova at noon and told her that he was impatient, but did

not say what he planned to do; she cautioned him to stay in his room

"and eat well." 517 She left him after a short while and, a few

minutes later, he took a taxi to the American Embassy, where he asked

to see the consul. (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 24, 912, 913, pp.

264, 263, 261.) When the receptionist asked him first to sign the

tourist register, he laid his passport on the desk and said that he

had come to "dissolve his American citizenship." Richard E. Snyder,

the Second Secretary and senior consular official,518 was summoned,

and he invited Oswald into his office.519


</p><p>Oswald's meeting with Snyder, at which Snyder's assistant, John A.

McVickar, was also present, is more fully discussed in appendix XV to

the Commission's report. Oswald declared that he wanted to renounce

his American citizenship; he denounced the United States and praised

the Government of the Soviet Union. Over Oswald's objections, Snyder

sought to learn something of Oswald's motives and background and to

forestall immediate action. Oswald told him that he had already

offered to tell a Soviet official what he had learned as a radar

operator in the Marines. The interview ended when Snyder told Oswald

that he could renounce his citizenship on the following Monday, 2 days

later, if he would appear personally to do so. During the interview,

Oswald handed to Snyder a note 520 which suggests that he had studied

and sought to comply with section 349 of the Immigration and

Nationality Act, which provides for loss of American citizenship.521

The note contains paragraphs which read like inartistic attempts to

cast off citizenship in three of the ways specified by the statute.

The attempts failed but there is no reason to doubt that they were

sincere. Snyder has testified that he believed that Oswald would

immediately have formally renounced his citizenship had he been

permitted to do so.522

</p><p>The interview lasted for less than an hour. Oswald returned to his

hotel angry about the delay but "elated" by the "showdown" and sure

that he would be permitted to remain after his "sign of ... faith"

in the Russians.523 Soon after he returned to the hotel, he was

</p><p><strong>Page 694</strong>

</p><p>approached by A. I. Goldberg, a reporter for the Associated Press,

whom the Embassy had told about Oswald's actions. Oswald refused to

speak to him.524 He answered a few questions for two other reporters,

R. J. Korengold and Miss Aline Mosby, but again refused to be

interviewed.525 Thereafter, the news services made repeated

unsuccessful attempts to interview him, which he thought was an

indirect form of pressure from the Embassy to return to the United

States.526

</p><p>On the day after Oswald's meeting with Snyder, his family read in

the newspapers about his appearance at the Embassy and tried to

contact him. Mrs. Oswald testified that she was shocked at her son's

decision to defect but, respected his motives for doing so; later she

suspected that he had been forcibly removed to Russia.527 She placed a

telephone call to him,528 but he either refused to speak to her 529 or

cut her off very quickly.530 So too, on November 2, he rejected the

Embassy's efforts to deliver or read on the telephone a telegram from

his brother Robert.531 A call from Robert was either canceled before

it was completed or was refused.532 Robert's telegram, along with a

message asking Oswald to contact, him immediately, which Robert had

asked the State Department to deliver,533 was finally sent to Oswald

from the Embassy by registered mail.534

</p><p>A few days later, the Embassy received a letter from Oswald dated

November 3 which requested that his citizenship be revoked.535 The

letter stated that he had appeared at the Embassy "for the purpose of

signing the formal papers to this effect" and protested against the

"conduct of the official" who had refused him "this legal right."

Oswald noted that his application for Soviet citizenship was pending

and said that if it were granted he would ask the Soviet Government

"to lodge a formal protest" on his behalf.536 The Embassy replied on

November 9 that Oswald could renounce his citizenship by appearing at

the Embassy and executing the necessary papers.537

</p><p>Oswald's diary describes the period from November 2 to November

15, during which he continued to isolate himself, as "days of utter

loneliness." 538 On November 8, he wrote to his brother:</p>

    <blockquote>Dear Robert

     <p>Well, what shall we talk about, the weather perhaps? Certainly you

do not wish me to speak of my decision to remain in the Soviet Union

and apply for citizenship here, since I'm afraid you would not be able

to comprehend my reasons. You really dent know anything about me.

Do you know for instance that I have waited to do this for well over a

year, do you know that I ... [phrase in Russian] speak a fair amount

of Russian which I have been studing for many months.

    </p><p>I have been told that I will not have to leave the Soviet Union if

I do not care to. this than is my decision. I will not leave this

country, the Soviet Union, under any conditions, I will never return

to the United States which is a country I hate.

    </p><p>Someday, perhaps soon, and than again perhaps in a few years, I

will become a citizen of the Soviet Union, but it is a very legal</p></blockquote>

<strong>Page 695</strong>

    <blockquote><p>process, in any event, I will not have to leave the Soviet Union and I

will never ... [word missing].<br><br>

    I recived your telegram and was glad to hear from you, only one

word bothered me, the word "mistake." I assume you mean that I have

made a "mistake" it is not for you to tell me that you cannot

understand my reasons for this very action.</p>

    <p>I will not speak to anyone from the United States over the

telephone since it may be taped by the Americans.

    </p><p>If you wish to corespond with me you can write to the below

address, but I really don't, see what we could take about if you want

to send me money, that I can us, but I do not expect to be able to

send it back.

    </p> LEE 589</blockquote>

	<p>

Oswald's statement that he had been told that he could remain in

Russia was not true. According to his diary, he was not told until

later that he could remain even temporarily in Russia,540 and only in

January was he told the he could remain indefinitely.541 The Embassy

tried to deliver a typed copy of a telegram from his brother John on

November 9; Oswald refused to answer the knock on his door, and the

message was then sent to him by registered mail.542

</p><p>Toward the end of this waiting period, probably on November 13,

Aline Mosby succeeded in interviewing Oswald.543 A reporter for United

Press International, she had called him on the telephone and was told

to come right over, Oswald's explanation being that he thought she

might "understand and be friendly" because she was a woman.544 She was

the first person who was not a Soviet citizen to whom he granted an

interview since his meeting with Snyder at the Embassy on October 31.

Miss Mosby found him polite but stiff; she said that be seemed full of

confidence, often showing a "small smile, more like a smirk," and that

he talked almost "non-stop." Oswald said to her that he had been told

that he could remain in the Soviet Union and that job possibilities

were being explored; they thought it probably would be best, he said,

to continue his education. He admitted that his Russian was bad but

was confident that it would improve rapidly. He based his dislike for

the United States on his observations of racial prejudice and the

contrast between "the luxuries of Park Avenue and workers' lives on

the East Side," and mentioned his mother's poverty; he said that if he

had remained in the United States he too would have become either a

capitalist or a worker. "One way or another." he said, "I'd lose in

the United States. In my own mind, even if I'd be exploiting other

workers. That's why I chose Marxist ideology."

</p><p>Oswald told his interviewer that he had been interested in

Communist theory since he was 15, when "an old lady" in New York

handed him "a pamphlet about saving the Rosenbergs." But when Mosby

asked if he were a member of the Communist Party he said that he had

never met a Communist and that he "might bare seen" one only once,

when he saw that "old lady." He told her that while

</p><p><strong>Page 696</strong>

</p><p>he was in the Marine Corps he had seen American imperialism in action,

and had saved $1,500 in secret preparation for his defection to

Russia. His only apparent regrets concerned his family: his mother,

whom he had not told of his plans, and his brother, who might lose his

job as a result of the publicity.545

</p><p>The interview lasted for about 2 hours. According to Oswald's own

account, he exacted a promise from Miss Mosby that she would show him

the story before publication but she broke the promise; he found the

published story to contain distortions of his words.546 Miss Mosby's

notes indicate that he called her to complain of the distortions,

saying in particular that his family had not been "poverty-stricken"

and that his defection was not prompted by personal hardship but that

was "a matter only of ideology."

</p><p>According to the diary, Oswald was told in mid-November that he

could remain temporarily in Russia "until some solution was found with

what to do" with him. 548 Armed with this "comforting news," 549 he

granted a second interview, again to a woman, on November 16.550 Miss

Priscilla Johnson of the North American Newspaper Alliance knocked on

the door of his room at the Metropole, and Oswald agreed to come to

her room at the hotel that evening. This interview lasted about 5

hours, from 9 p.m. until about 2 in the morning. During the interview

he frequently mentioned the fact that he would be able to remain in

Russia, which gave him great pleasure, but he also showed

disappointment about the difficulties standing in the way of his

request for Soviet citizenship. He repeated most of the information he

had given Aline Mosby and again denied having been a member of the

Communist Party or even ever having seen a Communist in the United

States. When Miss Johnson asked him to specify some of the socialist

writers whose works he had read during the past 5 years, he could name

only Marx and Engels; the only title he could recall was "Das

Kapital." They talked for a long while about Communist economic

theory, which Miss Johnson thought was "his language"; she became

convinced that his knowledge of the subject was very superficial.551

He commented that the Russians treated his defection as a "legal

formality," neither encouraging nor discouraging it.552 When she

suggested that if he really wished to renounce his American

citizenship he could do so by returning to the Embassy, he said that

he would "never set foot in the Embassy again," since he was sure that

he would be given the "same run-around" as before. He seemed to Miss

Johnson to be avoiding effective renunciation, consciously or

unconsciously, in order to preserve his right to reenter the United

States.553

</p><p>For the rest of the year, Oswald seldom left his hotel room where

he had arranged to take his meals, except perhaps for a few trips to

museums. He spent most of his time studying Russian,

hours a day" his diary records. The routine was broken only by another

interview at the passport office; occasional visits from Rima

Shirokova; lessons in Russian from her and other Intourist guides; and

a New Year's visit from Roza Agafonova, who gave

</p><p><strong>Page 697</strong>



</p><p>him a small "Boratin" clown as a New Year's present.554 He replied to

a letter from Robert in a letter quoted at length in chapter VII of

this report which contains his most bitter statements against the

United States.555 Robert received a third letter on December 17, in

which Oswald said that he would not write again and did not wish

Robert to write to him. The letter concluded:</p>

    <blockquote><p>I am starting a new life and I do not wish to have anything to do

with the old life.

    </p><p>I hope you and your family will always be in good health.

    </p> Lee 556</blockquote>

	
<p>
His mother mailed him a personal check for $20 dated December 18. It

was returned to her on January 5 with the notation that he could not

"use this check, of course"; he asked her to send him $20 in cash and

added that he had little money and needed "the rest," presumably a

reference to the $100 he had given her in September. Mrs. Oswald later

sent him a money order for about $25.557

</p><p>On January 4, Oswald was summoned to the Soviet Passport Office

and given Identity Document for Stateless Persons No. 811479.558 He

was told that he was being sent to Minsk,559 an industrial city

located about 450 miles southwest of Moscow and with a population in

1959 of about 510,000.560 His disappointment that he had not been

granted Soviet citizenship was balanced by relief that the uncertainty

was ended; he told Rima Shirokova that he was happy.561 On the

following day, he went to a Government agency which the Russians call

the "Red Cross"; it gave him 5,000 rubles (about 500 new rubles, or

$500 at the official exchange rate).562 He used 2,200 rubles to pay

his hotel bill and 150 rubles to purchase a railroad ticket to

Minsk. 563

</p><p>Oswald arrived in Minsk on January 7. He was met at the station by

two "Red Cross" workers who took him to the Hotel Minsk. Two Intourist

employees, both of whom spoke excellent English, were waiting for

him.564 One of them, a young woman named Roza Kuznetsova, became his

close friend and attended his 21st birthday party in October 1960.565

(See Commission Exhibit No. 2609, p. 271.) On the following day,

Oswald met the "Mayor," who welcomed him to Minsk, promised him a

rent-free apartment, and warned him against "uncultured persons" who

sometimes insulted foreigners.566

</p><p>Oswald reported for work at the Belorussian Radio and Television

Factory on January 13.567 Two days earlier he had visited the factory

and met Alexander Ziger, a Polish Jew who had emigrated to Argentina

in 1938 and went to Russia in 1955. Ziger was a department head at the

factory; he spoke English, and he and his family became good friends

of Oswald and corresponded with him after his return to the United

States.568 The factory, a major producer of electronic parts and

systems, employed about 5,000 persons.569 Oswald's union card

described him as a "metal worker"; 570 Marina testified that he

fashioned parts on a lathe.571 As Oswald later described it, the shop

in

</p><p><strong>Page 698</strong>

</p><p>which he worked, called the "experimental shop," 572 employed 58

workers and 5 foremen. It was located in the middle part of the

factory area in a 2-story building made of red brick. The workday

began at 8 o'clock sharp. Work was assigned according to "pay levels," which

were numbered from one to five plus a top "master" level. A worker

could ask to be tested for a higher level at any time.573

</p><p>Oswald had hoped to continue his education in Russia, and was

disappointed by his assignment to a factory.574 His salary varied from

700 to perhaps as high as 900 rubles per month ($70-$90) Although high

compared with the salaries of certain professional groups in Russia,

which in some areas have not grown proportionately with the wages of

factory workers,576 his salary was normal for his type of work.577 It

was supplemented, however, by 700 rubles per month, which he received

from the "Red Cross," and, according to Oswald, his total income was

about equal to that of the director of the factory.578 In August he

applied for membership in the union; he became a dues-paying member in

September.580

</p><p>Undoubtedly more noteworthy to most Russians than his extra income

was the attractive apartment which Oswald was given in March 1959. It

was a small flat with a balcony overlooking the river,581 for which he

paid only 60 rubles a month.582 (See Commission Exhibit No. 2606, p.

271.) Oswald describes it in his diary as "a Russian-dream." 583 Had

Oswald been a Russian worker, he would probably have had to wait for

several years for a comparable apartment, and would have been given

one even then only if he had a family.584 The "Red Cross" subsidy and

the apartment were typical of the favorable treatment which the Soviet

Union has given defectors.585

</p><p>Oswald's diary records that he enjoyed his first months in Minsk.

His work at the factory was easy and his coworkers were friendly and

curious about life in the United States; he declined an invitation to

speak at a mass meeting. He took Roza Kuznetsova, his interpreter and

language teacher,586 to the theater, a movie, or an opera almost every

night, until he moved into his apartment and temporarily lost contact

with her. He wrote in his diary, "I'm living big and am very

satisfied." 587 In March or April, he met Pavel Golovachev, a

co-worker at the factory, whom Oswald described as intelligent and

friendly and an excellent radio technician. (See Commission Exhibit

No. 2609, p. 271.) Oswald helped Golovachev with English.588 They

became friends,589 and corresponded after Oswald returned to the

United States until at least as late as September 1963.590

</p><p>The spring and summer passed easily and uneventfully. There were

picnics and drives in the country, which Oswald described as "green

beauty." 591 On June 18, he obtained a hunting license and soon

afterward purchased a 16-gage single-barrel shotgun. His hunting

license identifies him as "Aleksy Harvey Oswald." (He was called

"Alec" by his Russian friends, because "Lee" sounded foreign to them

and was difficult for them to pronounce.)592 He joined a local chapter

of the Belorussian Society of Hunters and Fishermen, a hunting club

sponsored by his factory, and hunted for small game in the

</p><p><strong>Page 699</strong>

</p><p>farm regions around Minsk about half a dozen times in the summer and

fall. The hunters spent the night in small villages and often left

their bag with the villagers; Oswald described the peasant life which

he saw as crude and poor.593 Sometime in June, he met. Ella German, a

worker at the factory, of whom he later said he "perhaps fell in love

with her the first minute" he saw her.594 (See Commission Exhibit No.

2609, p. 271.)

</p><p>At the same time, however, the first signs of disillusionment with

his Russian life appeared. He noted in his diary that he felt "uneasy

inside" after a friend took him aside at a party and advised him to

return to the United States.595 Another entry compared life in Minsk

with military life:</p>

    <blockquote>I have become habituatated to a small care which is where I dine in

the evening. The food is generaly poor and always eactly the same,

menue in any care, at any point in the city. The food is cheap and I

don't really care about quiality after three years in the U.S.M.C.596</blockquote>

<p>

In an entry for August-September, he wrote that he was becoming

"increasingly concious of just what sort of a society" he lived in.597

</p><p>He spent New Year's Day at the home of Ella German and her family.

They ate and drank in a friendly atmosphere, and he was "drunk and

happy" when he returned home. During the walk back to his apartment he

decided to ask Ella to marry him. On the following night, after he had

brought her home from the movies, he proposed on her doorstep. She

rejected him, saying that she did not love him and that she was afraid

to marry an American. She said that the Polish intervention in the

1920's had led to the arrest of all people in the Soviet Union of

Polish origin and she feared that something similar might happen to

Americans some day. Oswald was "too stunned to think," and concluded

that she had gone out with him only because she was envied by the

other girls for having an American as an escort.598 But in one of the

entries in the diary he appears to have attributed her failure to love

him to "a state of fear which was always in the Soviet Union." 599 His

affection for Ella German apparently continued for some time; 600 he

had his last formal date with her in February and remained on friendly

terms with her as long as he was in Russia.601

</p><p>After he returned to the United States, Oswald often commented on

Russian life. He discussed the Soviet systems of public education and

medical care.603 He observed to one acquaintance that everyone in

Russia was trained to do something,604 and discussed with another the

system of regular wage and salary increases.605 His most frequent

criticisms concerned the contrast between the lives of ordinary

workers and the lives of Communist Party members. He told an

acquaintance in Dallas that the working class in the Soviet Union made

just about enough to buy clothing and food and that only party members

could afford luxuries.606 On another occasion, he remarked

</p><p><strong>Page 700</strong>

</p><p>that if he had as much money as some of the "managers," he could

have visited the Black Sea resorts.607 He complained about the lack of

freedom in Russia; 608 the lack of opportunity to travel; 609

inadequate housing; 610 and the chronic scarcity of food products.611

To one acquaintance, he observed that the party members were all

"opportunists," who "shouted the loudest and made the most noise," but

who were interested only in their own welfare.612

</p><p>He expressed similar views in a manuscript which he worked on in

Russia 613 and probably intended to publish; soon after he returned to

the United States, he hired a stenographer to prepare a typed draft

from his notes.614 Oswald described the manuscript, which amounted to

50 typed pages, as "a look into the lives of work-a-day average

Russians."615

</p><p>The manuscript describes the factory in which Oswald worked and

suggests that political considerations of which Oswald disapproved

dominated its operation. He attributed the lack of unemployment to the

shortage of labor-saving machinery and the heavy load of bureaucracy,

which kept "tons of paper work" flowing in and out of the factory and

required a high foreman-worker ratio.616 In addition, he wrote, there

was "a small army of examiners, committees, and supply checkers and

the quality-control board."

</p><p>He described life in Russia, including life at the factory, as

centered around the "Kollective." The head of the Kollective in his

shop, Comrade Lebizen, saw to it that everyone maintained shop

discipline, attended party meetings, and received all the new

propaganda as it came out. He hung the walls of the shop with signs

and slogans of the Communist Party. Meetings of the Kollective were

"so numerous as to be staggering." In a single month, there were

scheduled one meeting of the professional union, four political

information meetings, two young Communist meetings, one meeting of the

production committee to discuss ways of improving work, two Communist

Party meetings, four meetings of the "School of Communist Labor," and

one sports meeting. All but one of them were compulsory for Communist

Party members and all but three were compulsory for everyone.618

(Marina Oswald testified that her husband did not attend the courses

in Marxism and Leninism given in the factory for party members and

those who wished to become party members.)619 They were scheduled so

as not to interfere with work, and lasted anywhere from 10 minutes to

2 hours. Oswald said that no one liked the meetings, which were

accepted "philosophically"; at the political meetings especially,

everyone paid strict attention, and party members were posted in the

audience to watch for the slightest sign that one's attention might

relax, even for a moment.620

</p><p>Oswald wrote that the "spontaneous" demonstrations on Soviet

holidays or for distinguished visitors were almost as well organized

as the Kollectivist meetings at the factory.621 He noted that

elections were supervised to ensure that everyone voted, and that they

voted for the candidates of the Communist Party. The manuscript

touches on other aspects of Soviet life--as the housing shortage and


the corrup-

</p><p><strong>Page 701</strong>

</p><p>tion which it evoked, the "rest-homes" where workers had their

vacations, television and the omnipresent radio, and Russian reading

habits.622 This writing also may include only what Oswald thought

might be acceptable.

</p><p>On January 4, 1961, I year after he had been issued his

"stateless" residence permit, Oswald was summoned to the passport

office in Minsk and asked if he still wanted to become a Soviet

citizen. He replied that he did not, but asked that his residence

permit be extended for another year.623 The entry in his diary for

January 4-31 reads: "I am stating to reconsider my disire about

staying. The work is drab. The money I get has nowhere to be spent. No

nightclubs or bowling allys, no places of recreation acept the trade

union dances. I have had enough." 624

</p><p>The American Embassy in Moscow had not heard from Oswald after it

received his letter of November 3, 1959.625 On February 13, 1961, it

received an undated letter from him which had been mailed in Minsk

about a week earlier. He asked for the return of his passport and

stated that he wanted to return to the United States if he could "come

to some agreement [with the American Government] concerning the

dropping of any legal proceedings" against him. He noted that he had

not become a Soviet citizen and was living in Russia with

"nonpermanent type papers for a foreigner," and said that he did not

appear personally because he could not leave Minsk without permission.

The letter concluded: "I hope that in recalling the responsibility I

have to America that you remember yours in doing everything you can to

help me, since I am an American citizen." 626 In this letter, Oswald

referred to a previous letter which he said had gone unanswered; there

is evidence that such a letter was never sent.627

</p><p>The Second Secretary, Richard Snyder, answered on February 28 that

Oswald would have to appear at the Embassy personally to discuss his

return to the United States.628 In the meantime, Oswald's mother, who

in January had inquired at the Department of State about his

whereabouts,629 had been notified of his letter.630 A second letter

from Oswald, posted on March 5, reached the Embassy on March 20; it

reiterated that he was unable to leave Minsk without permission and

asked that "preliminary inquiries ... be put in the form of

questionnaire" and sent to him.631 His diary entry for this period

records his "state of expectation about going back to the U.S.," and

adds that a friend had approved his plans but warned him not to

discuss them with others.632 (The Soviet authorities had undoubtedly

intercepted and read the correspondence between Oswald and the Embassy

and knew of his plans.633 Soon after the correspondence began, his

monthly payments from the "Red Cross" were cut off.)634  Having

informed Washington,635 the Embassy wrote to Oswald on March 24,

stating again that he would have to come to Moscow.636 Later, the

Department of State decided that Oswald's passport should be returned

to him only if he appeared at the Embassy for it and the Embassy was

satisfied, after exploring the matter with him, that he had not

renounced his citizenship.637

</p><p><strong>Page 702</strong>

</p><p>Sometime in the second week of March, Miss Katherine Mallory, who

was on tour in Minsk with the University of Michigan symphonic band,

found herself surrounded by curious Russian citizens. A young man who

identified himself as a Texan and former marine stepped out of the

crowd and asked if she needed an interpreter; he interpreted for her

for the next 15 or 20 minutes. Later he told her that he despised the

United States and hoped to stay in Minsk for the rest of his life.

Miss Mallory is unable to swear that her interpreter was Oswald, but

is personally convinced that it was he.638

</p><p>A few days later, probably on March 17, Oswald attended a trade

union dance with a friend, Erik Titovyets, at the Palace of Culture

for Professional Workers in Minsk.639 The dance followed a lecture by

a Russian woman who had recently returned from a trip to the United

States.640 Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova arrived too late to hear the

lecture 641 but was at the dance. Oswald noticed her and asked Yuriy

Merezhinskiy, the son of the lecturer and a friend of both Oswald and

Marina, to introduce him to her. Oswald asked her to dance. According

to the diary, they liked each other immediately and he obtained her

telephone number before she left.642 Marina testified that she told

Oswald that she might see him at another dance, but did not give him

her telephone number.643 Oswald was smitten.644

</p><p>Marina Prusakova was 19 years old when she met Oswald. (See

Commission Exhibit No. 1395, p. 270.) She was born on July 17, 1941,

at Severodvinsk (formerly Molotovsk),Arkhangel Oblast', Russia.645 A

few years later, her mother, Klavdiya Vasilievna Prusakova, married

Aleksandr Ivanovich Medvedev, who became the only father Marina

knew.646 While she was still a young girl, Marina went to

Arkhangel'sk, Arkhangel Oblast', to live with her maternal

grandparents, Tatyana Yakovlevna Prusakova and Vasiliy Prusakov. Her

grandfather died when Marina was about 4 years old; she continued to

live with her grandmother for some time.647 When she was not more than

7, she moved to Zguritva, Moldavian SSR (formerly called Bessarabia)

to live with her mother and stepfather, who was an electrical

worker.648 In 1952, the family moved to Leningrad,649 where her

stepfather obtained a job in a power station.650 Marina testified that

neither he nor her mother was a member of the Communist Party.651

</p><p>In Leningrad, Marina attended the Three Hundred and Seventy-Fourth

Women's School. After she had completed the seventh grade at the

school in 1955,652 she entered the Pharmacy Teknikum for special

training, which she had requested on the ground that her mother was

ill and Marina might need to have a specialty in order to support

herself. While she was st the Teknikum, she joined the Trade Union for

Medical Workers 653 and, in her last year there, worked part time in

the Central Pharmacy in Leningrad. She graduated from the Teknikum

with a diploma in pharmacy in June 1959.

</p><p>Marina's mother had died in 1957, during Marina's second year at

the Teknikum; she continued to live with her stepfather, but had

little contact with him. She testified that she did not get along with

</p><p><strong>Page 703</strong>

</p><p>her stepfather, whom she displeased by her fresh conduct; she said

that she was not easily disciplined 654 and was a source of concern to

him.655 Because of the friction between them, Marina regarded her

childhood as an unhappy one.

</p><p>After her graduation, Marina was assigned to a job preparing and

packing orders in a pharmaceutical warehouse in Leningrad; as a new

employee she had the right to leave this job within 3 days after the

assignment,656 and she did so after the first day. She took no job for

the next 2 months, at the end of which she went to live in Minsk with

an aunt and uncle, the Prusakova, who had no children. She had known

them since she was a child and there was a mutual affection between

her and them.657 Her uncle, a member of the Communist Party,658 was

assigned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and headed the local

bureau concerned with lumber. The Prusakova had one of the best

apartments in a building reserved for MVD employees.659

</p><p>Marina was 18 when she arrived in Minsk. She had boyfriends in

Leningrad but was not interested in marriage. In October 1960 she

started work in the drug section of the Third Clinical Hospital where

she earned about 450 rubles per month;660 at about the same time she

became a member of the local Komsomol, the Communist youth

organization.661 Her friends were mostly students, whose social life

consisted of meeting in cafes to sip coffee, read newspapers, gossip,

and carry on discussions. The group of friends "ran together," and

Marina did not attach herself to a particular boyfriend. She enjoyed

this life, which she had been leading for about 7 months when she met

Oswald at the dance at the Palace of Culture in March 1961.662

</p><p>When Marina met Oswald, she thought he was from one of the

Russian-speaking Baltic countries because he spoke with an accent;

later that same evening she learned that he was an American.663 She

met him again at another dance a week later. 664 They danced together

most of the evening, at the end of which he walked home with her. They

arranged to meet again the following week. 665 Before the scheduled

time, Oswald called to say that he was in the hospital and that Marina

should visit him there. 666 Medical records furnished to the

Commission by the Russian Government show that Oswald was admitted to

the Clinical Hospital--Ear, Nose, and Throat Division, on Thursday,

March 30, 1961.667 Marina visited him often,668 taking advantage of

her uniform to visit him outside regular visiting hours, which were

only on Sunday. 669 On Easter Sunday, the first Sunday after his

admission to the hospital, she brought him an Easter egg.670 On a

subsequent visit, he asked her to be his fiancee, and she agreed to

consider it.671 He left the hospital on April 11.672

</p><p>During these visits, Marina apparently discussed with Oswald his

reasons for coming to Russia and his current status. According to her

later account, he told her that he had surrendered his American

documents to the Embassy in Moscow and had told American officials

that he did not intend to return to the United States. He did not say

definitely that he was no longer an American citizen, but said in

answer

</p><p><strong>Page 704</strong>

</p><p>to a question about his citizenship that he could not return to the

United States.673

</p><p>Oswald visited Marina regularly at her aunt and uncle's apartment;

they were apparently not disturbed by the fact that, he was an

American and did not disapprove of her seeing him. He continued to ask

her to marry him and, according to her recollection, she accepted his

proposal on April 20; 674 Oswald's diary puts the date 5 days

earlier.675 Marina testified that she believed that Oswald could not

return to, the United States when she agreed to marry him, and that

she had not married him in hope of going to the United States.676

</p><p>After filing notice of their intent to marry at the registrar,

obtaining the special consent necessary for an alien to marry a

citizen, and waiting the usual 10 days, they were married on April

30.677 The diary entry for the wedding day reads:</p>

    <blockquote>two of Marinas girl friends act as bridesmaids. We are married. At

her aunts home we have a dinner reception for about 20 friends and

neboribos who wish us happiness (in spite of my origin and accept

[accent?] which was in general rather disquiting to any Russian since

for are very rare in the soviet Union even tourist. After an evening

of eating and drinking in which ... [Marina's uncle] started a

fright [fight?] and the fuse blow on an overloaded circite we take our

leave and walk the 1-5 minutes to our home. We lived near each other,

at midnight we were home.678</blockquote>


<p>
They both took 3 days off from their jobs, which they spent in

Minsk.679

</p><p>Oswald wrote in his diary for May 1, 1 day after the wedding:

"In spite of  fact I married Marina to hurt Ella I found myself in

love with Marina." 680 The next entry, marked simply "May," reads in

part:</p>

    

    <blockquote>The trasistion of changing full love from Ella to Marina was very

painfull esp. as I saw Ella almost every day at the factory but as the

days &amp; weeks went by I adjusted more and more [to] my wife mentaly ... 

She is maddly in love with me from the very start. Boat rides on

Lake Minsk walks through the parks evening at home or at Aunt Valia's

place mark May." 681</blockquote>

<p>

And in June: "A continuence of May, except that; we draw closer and

closer, and I think very little now of Ella." 682

</p><p>Sometime within the first month or two after they were married

Oswald told his wife that he was anxious to return to the United

States. The diary says that he told her "in the last days" of June and

that she was "slightly startled" but encouraged him to do as he

wished.683 Marina's recollection is that she learned of his plan

between May and July. Embassy records show that Oswald notified the

Embassy in a letter received on May 25 that he was married and his

wife would

</p><p><strong>Page 705</strong>

</p><p>seek to accompany him to the United States.684 At about this time, the

Oswalds began to make inquiries in Soviet offices about exit visas.

685

</p><p>While these preparations were being made, the Oswalds apparently

enjoyed their new life.686 They ate most of their meals in cares or at

restaurants where they worked.687 For amusement, they went boating,

attended the opera, concerts, the circus, and films; occasionally,

they gathered with a group of friends for a cooperative meal at

someone's apartment.688 His Russian improved, but he retained an

accent and never learned to speak grammatically or to write well.689

He read the English language edition of the Daily Worker and books,

also in English, on Marxism and Leninism; he also read some Russian

newspapers.690

</p><p>Before he married Marina (and presumably before February, when he

had begun his efforts to return to the United States) Oswald had

applied for admission to the Patrice Lumumba Friendship University in

Moscow. He received a letter dated May 3 apologizing for the delay in

responding to his application and turning it down on the ground that

the university had been established exclusively for students from the

underdeveloped countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. 691

Oswald expressed his disappointment at having been turned down to

Marina.692

</p><p>Oswald reopened his correspondence with his family on May 5, with

a friendly letter to his brother Robert. He said nothing about, his

contacts with the American Embassy, but mentioned that he had married,

and that he had a job as a "metal-smith" and was living well. He asked

his brother for their mother's address, and encouraged him to come to

Minsk for a visit.693 Robert answered the letter quickly. On May 31,

Oswald wrote again and expressed his pleasure at having heard from

Robert after so long. Apparently in response to an offer to send him

whatever he needed, Oswald wrote that he needed nothing and thanked

Robert for the thought; he suggested, however, that Marina might like

a small wedding present. At the end of the letter he said that he did

not know whether he would ever return to the United States; he said

that before he could return he would have to obtain the permission of

the Soviet Union for him and Marina to leave and insure that no

charges would be lodged against him in the United States. In this

letter, he mentioned that he was in touch with the Embassy in

Moscow.694 At about this time, Oswald wrote also to his mother. 695

</p><p>On May 25, the Embassy received a letter mailed in Minsk about 10

days before, in which Oswald asked for assurances that he would not be

prosecuted if he returned to the United States, and informed the

Embassy that he had married a Russian woman who would want to

accompany him.696 The Embassy communicated this development to

Washington 697 and did not answer Oswald immediately. In addition, he

had no word since March concerning the return of his passport.

Impatient for action,698 he appeared without warning at the Embassy on

July 8; it was a Saturday and the offices were closed.699 He used the

house telephone to reach Snyder, who came

</p><p><strong>Page 706</strong>

</p><p>to the office, talked with him briefly, and suggested that he return

on the following Monday.700 Oswald called Marina and asked her join

him in Moscow. She arrived on Sunday, July 9, 701 a room at the Hotel

Berlin,702 where he had stayed when he first arrived in Russia.

</p><p>Oswald returned to the Embassy on Monday. Marina waited outside

during his interview with Snyder,703 who asked to see Oswald's Soviet

papers and questioned him closely about his life in Russia and

possible expatriating acts. Oswald stated that he was not a citizen of

the Soviet Union and had never formally applied for citizenship, that

he had never taken an oath of allegiance to the Soviet Union, and that

he was not a member of the factory trade union organization. He said

that he had never given Soviet officials any confidential information

that he had learned in the Marines, had never been asked to give such

information, and "doubted" that he would have done so had he been

asked.704 Some of Oswald's statements during this interview were

undoubtedly false. He had almost certainly applied for citizenship in

the Soviet Union 705 and, at least for a time, been disappointed when

it was denied.706 He possessed a membership card in the union

organization.707 In addition, his assertion to Snyder that he had

never been questioned by Soviet authorities concerning his life in the

United States is simply unbelievable.

</p><p>Oswald showed anxiety, already displayed in his letters, that he

might be prosecuted and imprisoned if he returned to the United

States. Snyder told him informally that he did not know any grounds on

which he would be prosecuted but that he could give no assurances in

this regard.708 Snyder testified that Oswald seemed to have matured

while he was in Russia and did not show the bravado and arrogance

which characterized his first contacts with the Embassy. Oswald told

him that he had "learned a hard lesson the hard way" and had acquired

a new appreciation of the United States and the meaning of freedom.709

</p><p>Since Oswald's passport would expire on September 10, 1961,710

before which date he probably would not be able to obtain Russian exit

papers, he filled out an application for its renewal.711 On a

questionnaire attached to the application,712 he reiterated his oral

statements that he had obtained only a residence permit in the Soviet

Union and was still an American national. On the basis of Oswald's

written and oral statements, Snyder concluded that he had not

expatriated himself and returned his passport, stamped valid only for

direct travel to the United States,713 to him. Accompanied by his

wife,714 Oswald came to the Embassy again on the following day,715 to

initiate procedures for her admission to the United States as an

immigrant; they had a routine interview with McVickar, Snyder's

assistant.716 Three days later, they returned to Minsk.717

</p><p>On the same day, Oswald wrote to his brother. He told Robert that

he had his passport again and that he and Marina were doing everything

possible to leave the Soviet Union. Apparently referring to his

initial reappearance at the Embassy in quest of his passport, he

</p><p><strong>Page 707</strong>

</p><p>wrote: "I could write a book about how many feeling have come and gone

since that day." The letter closed with an affectionate greeting to

his brother and his family.718 The letter's tone of firm purpose to

return to the United States in the face of heavy odds reflected

Oswald's attitude thereafter.

</p><p>As soon as they returned to Minsk, the Oswalds began to work with

local authorities for permission to leave the country.719 His diary

entry for July 16 through August 20 reads,</p>

    <blockquote>We have found out which blanks and certificates are nessceary to

apply for a exit visa. They number about 20 papers; birth

certificates, affidavit, photos, ect. On Aug 20th we give the papers

out they say it will be 3.5 months before we know wheather they let us

go or not. In the meantime Marina has had to stade 4 differant meeting

at the place of work held by her boss's at the direction of "someone"

by phone. The Young Comm. leauge headquttes also called about her and

she had to go see them for 1-1/2 hours. The purpose (expressed) is to

disuade her from going to the U.S.A. Net effect: Make her more

stubborn about wanting to go. Marina is pregnet. We only hope that the

visas come through soon.720</blockquote>

<p>

In a letter dated July 15, he reported their efforts to the Embassy,

and said that he would keep it informed "as to the overall picture."

The letter mentioned that Marina was having difficulties at work

because of her decision to leave but added that such "tactics" were

"quite useless" and that Marina had "stood up well, without getting

into trouble." 721 For August 21 through September 1, the diary reads:
</p>
    <blockquote>I make repeated trips to the passport &amp; visa office, also to

Ministry of For. Affairs in Minsk, also Min. of Internal Affairs, all

of which have a say in the granting of a visa. I extrackted promises

of quick attention to us.722</blockquote>

<p>

For September through October 18, "No word from Min. ('They'11 call

us.')." 723

</p><p>Marina testified that when the news of her visit to the American

Embassy in July reached Minsk, she was dropped from membership in

"Komsomol," the Communist Youth Organization, 724 and that "meetings

were arranged" at which "members of the various organizations"

attempted to dissuade her from leaving the Soviet Union.725 Her aunt

and uncle did not speak to her for "a long time." 726 Paul Gregory, to

whom Marina taught Russian in the United States, testified that she

once referred to this period of her life in Minsk as "a very horrible

time." 727

</p><p>Oswald wrote to the Embassy again on October 4, to request that

the U.S. Government officially intervene to facilitate his and his

wife's applications for exit visas.728 He stated that there had been

"systematic and concerted attempts to intimidate [Marina] ... into

with-

</p> <strong>Page 708</strong>

 <p>drawing her application for a visa" which had resulted in her being

hospitalized for a 5-day period on September 22 for "nervous

exhaustion." 729 Marina has denied that she was hospitalized for a

nervous disorder 730 and he made no mention of it in his diary or

letters to his family; he probably lied to the Embassy. The Embassy

replied to his letter on October 12, saying that it had no way of

influencing Soviet conduct on such matters and that its experience had

been that action on applications for exit visas was "seldom taken

rapidly." 731



</p><p>In October 1961 Marina took her annual vacation. 732 She and

Oswald agreed that she should get a "change of scenery," 733 and she

spent about 3 weeks with an aunt in Khar'kov. It is possible that they

were not getting along well together during this period. 734 A dairy

entry after her return indicates that they were having some quarrels

and that she was wavering in her decision to go to the United States,

which Oswald attributed to anxiety about their applications for visas

and the fact that she was pregnant; he in turn dreaded the approach of

the "hard Russian winter." 735 He noted in his dairy that he was

lonely while she was gone, but that he and his friend "Erich,"

presumably Erik Titovyets, went to some dances and other public

amusements.736 On his 22nd birthday he went alone to see his favorite

opera, "The Queen of Spades." 737 Marina sent him a gold and silver

cup, inscribed "To my dear husband on his birthday, 18/x/61" and other

gifts, for which he wrote to thank her.738 She returned on November

12, in Oswald's words, "radient, with several jars of preserses for me

from her aunt." 739

</p><p>Sometime after Marina's return Oswald applied for an interview

with Col. Nicolay Aksenov, an official in the local MVD, in an effort

to expedite their application for exit visas; he was told by the

colonel's subordinates that they were competent to handle the matter.

Oswald then insisted that Marina seek an interview; she agreed

reluctantly. The interview was granted; 740 Marina thought that this

might have been due to the fact that her uncle was also a high-ranking

official in the Minsk MVD, but she did not believe that he would

personally have presumed on his official position to obtain special

treatment.741 Colonel Aksenov questioned her about her reasons for

wanting to go to the United States and, noticing that she was

pregnant, suggested that she at least delay her departure so that her

child could be born in Russia, but did not otherwise try to discourage

her. He finally told her that there were many others seeking visas and

that she and her husband would have to wait their turn.742

</p><p>Throughout this period, Oswald continued to correspond with his

mother and brother. His letters contained the usual chatter among

members of a family and occasional references to the progress of the

visa applications.743 He wrote to the Embassy on November 1, saying

that if, as he anticipated, his residence permit were renewed in

January for another year, it would be over his protest. 744  On

November 13 the Embassy replied, telling Oswald that retention of his

Soviet passport, which was of the kind issued to persons considered to

be stateless, or an extension of it, would not prejudice his claim to

Ameri-

</p><p><strong>Page 709</strong>

</p><p>can citizenship. The letter added that he could discuss the renewal of

his American passport whenever he appeared in person at the Embassy to

do so.745

</p><p>Late in December, Oswald wrote a letter to Senator John G. Tower

of Texas, which was received in Washington near the end of January. He

stated that he was an American citizen and that the Soviet Government

refused to permit him and his wife to leave the Soviet Union. He asked

Senator Tower to raise "the question of holding by the Soviet Union of

a citizen of the U.S., against his will and expressed desires." The

letter was referred to the State Department and no further action

concerning it was taken.746 On December 25, Marina was called to the

Soviet Passport Office and told that exit visas would be granted to

her and her husband; she was surprised, having doubted that she would

ever be permitted to leave. Oswald wrote to the Embassy on December 27

that they would be given visas and asked that his passport be extended

without another trip to Moscow; he added, however, that he would come

to Moscow if this would expedite the processing of his application. In

his diary, he wrote, "It's great (I think?)." 747 Before the year

ended, Marina went on maternity leave from her job.748 They spent New

Year's Eve at a dinner party given by the Zigers.749

</p><p>Oswald wrote to his mother on January 2, 1962, and told her that

he and his wife expected to arrive in the United States sometime

around March. He asked her to contact the local Red Cross and request

that it put his case before the International Rescue Committee or some

other group which aids immigrants to the United States. He told her

that he would need about $800 and that she should insist on a gift

rather than a loan; he told her not to send any of her own money.750

Despite his instructions, she requested a loan from the Red Cross.751

On January 13, Oswald wrote to the International Rescue Committee

himself; he asked for $800 with which to purchase two tickets from

Moscow to Texas.752 He wrote to the Committee again on January 26,

this time asking for $1,000.753

</p><p>In the meantime, letters of Oswald 754 and the American

Embassy,755 both dated January 5, crossed in the mail. The Embassy's

letter suggested that since there might be difficulties in obtaining

an American visa for Marina, he consider returning alone and bringing

her over later. He replied on the 16th that he would not leave Russia

without her.756 In his letter, Oswald requested that the U.S.

Government loan him the money for his and Marina's airplane tickets or

arrange a loan from another source. The Embassy replied on January 15

that Marina had not yet obtained an American visa and that no

evidence had yet been submitted that she would not become a public

charge in the United States.757 It suggested that Oswald's mother or

some other close relative file an affidavit of support in Marina's

behalf. Before receiving this letter, Oswald wrote out such a document

himself 758 and mailed it to the Embassy.759



</p><p>On January 28, after receiving the Embassy's letter, he wrote that

his own affidavit should be sufficient, since he had been away from



</p><p><strong>Page 710</strong>



</p><p>the United States for more than 2 years and could not be expected to

obtain an affidavit from someone else.760 But on the same day, he

wrote to his mother asking that she file an affidavit of support with

the Immigration and Naturalization Service.761 On January 24, the

Embassy acknowledged receipt of his affidavit, but again suggested

that he obtain one from someone else.762

</p><p>Late in January, Oswald received a letter from his mother telling

him that he had been given a dishonorable discharge from the

Marines.763 (The discharge had actually been "undesirable," a less

derogatory characterization.) 764 This apparently revived his fear of

prosecution, and on January 30, he wrote to his brother for more

information.765 On the same day he wrote also to John B. Connally,

Jr., then Governor of Texas, who Oswald believed was still Secretary

of Navy. The letter read:</p>

    <blockquote><p>I wish to call your attention to a case about which you may have

personal knowlege since you are a resident of Ft. Worth as I am.

    </p><p>In November 1959 an event was well publicated in the Ft. Worth

newspapers concerning a person who had gone to the Soviet Union to

reside for a short time, (much in the same way E. Hemingway resided in

Paris.)

    </p><p>This person in answers to questions put to him by reporteds in

Moscow criticized certain facets of american life. The story was blown

up into another "turncoat" sensation, with the result that the Navy

department gave this person a belated dishonourable discharge,

although he had received an honourable discharge after three years

service on Sept. 11, 1959 at El Toro, Marine corps base in California.

    </p><p>These are the basic facts of my case.

    </p><p>I have and allways had the full sanction of the U.S. Embassy,

Moscow USSR. and hence the U.S. government. In as much as I am

returning to the U.S.A. in this year with the aid of the U.S. Embassy,

bring with me my family (since I married in the USSR) I shall employ

all means to right this gross mistake or injustice to a boni-fied U.S.

citizen and ex--service man. The U.S. government has no charges or

complaints against me. I ask you to look into this case. and take the

neccessary steps to repair the damage done to me. and my family. For

information I would direct you to consult the American Embassy,

Chikovski St. 19/21, Moscow, USSR.766</p></blockquote>


<p>
Connally referred the letter to the Department of the Navy,767 which

sent Oswald a letter stating that the Department contemplated no

change in the undesirable discharge. 768 On March 22, Oswald wrote to

the Department insisting that his discharge be given a further, full

review.769 The Department promptly replied that it had no authority to

hear and review petitions of this sort and referred Oswald to the Navy

Discharge Review Board.770 Oswald filled out

</p><p><strong>Page 711</strong>

</p><p>the enclosed application for review in Minsk but did not mail it until

he returned to the United States.771

</p><p>The Department of State had notified Oswald's mother that it would

need $900 to make the travel arrangements for her son and

daughter-in-law.772 On February 1, Oswald sent his mother a brief

letter rejecting her suggestion that she try to raise money by telling

the newspapers about his financial plight.773 Five days later, the

Embassy Oswald wrote to his mother again on February 9, reminding her

to file an affidavit of support and asking that she send him clippings

from the Fort Worth newspapers about his defection to Russia, a

request which he later repeated to his brother. He told her that he

wanted to know what had been written about him, so that he could be

"forewarned."

</p><p>Oswald took Marina to the hospital on the morning of February 15.

A baby girl was born at about 10 a.m.776 He had gone on to the factory

where news of the birth awaited him on his arrival.777 In accordance

with regular hospital practice,778 he did not see the baby until

Marina left the hospital.779 He was excited by the child,780 who was

named "June Lee" in accordance with the Russian custom and law that a

child's second name must be the father's first name or a variation of

it. He had wanted to name his child "June Marina," and protested the

application of the law to her, since he had a United States passport.

His diary contains the wry comment, "Po-Russki." 781 His coworkers at

the factory gave the Oswalds "one summer blanket, 6 light diapers, 4

warm diapers, 2 chemises, 3 very good warm chemises, 4 very nice suits

and two toys" for the baby.782 Marina came home on February 23.783

</p><p>There was less urgency about the departure for the United States

after June Lee was born.784 Oswald wrote to his mother,785 and

brother,786 that he would probably not arrive for several months. The

Embassy received a letter on March 3, in which Oswald applied for a

loan of $800; 787 the Embassy replied that it was authorized to loan

him only $500.788 It had in the meantime decided that his own

affidavit of support for Marina would be sufficient under the

circumstances.789 On March 15, he received notification from the

Immigration and Naturalization Service that Marina's application for a

visa had been approved.790 By March 28, he had received an affidavit

of support in Marina's behalf from his mother's employer, Byron K.

Phillips, 791 which he filed although it was no longer necessary to do

so.792 A few days before, Marina, still on maternity leave, had quit

her job. 793 Discussions with the Embassy to complete financial and

travel arrangements continued in April and May.794 In a letter to

Robert on April 12, Oswald wrote that only "the American side" was

holding up their departure, but added that the winter being over, he

didn't "really ... want to leave until the beginning of fall, since

the spring and summer ... [in Russia] are so nice." 795

</p><p><strong>Page 712</strong>

</p><p>On May 10, the Embassy wrote that everything was in order and

suggested that Oswald come to the Embassy with his family to sign the

final papers.796 At his request,797 he was discharged from the factory

on about May 18.798 His work had apparently never been very good.

Marina testified that he was rather lazy and resented having to take

orders.799 This estimate is confirmed by a report of the plant

director and personnel department chief, filed on December 11, 1961,

which was apparently a routine assessment of his work. The report

noted that he did not, "display the initiative for increasing his

skill" in his job, that he was "over-sensitive ... to remarks from

the foremen, and ... careless in his work"; Oswald took "no part in

the social life of the shop" and kept "very much to himself." 800

</p><p>Oswald picked up his Soviet, exit visa on May 22; 801 at about

this time, he also had an interview with an official of the MVD to

obtain final clearance for his departure. 802 He wrote to Robert that

he and his family would leave for Moscow on the following day and depart

for England 10 to 14 days later. He expected to cross the Atlantic by

ship, probably docking in New Orleans. Returning to a point which he

had made in an earlier letter to his mother, he commented that he knew

from the newspaper clippings what Robert had said about him when he

left for Russia; he thought that Robert had talked too much at that

time, and asked that Robert say nothing to the newspapers now. 803



</p><p>The Oswalds arrived in Moscow by May 24 804 and on that date

filled out various documents at the American Embassy; 805 Marina was

given her American visa.806 Final arrangements for their emigration

were made with Soviet officials. 807 On June 1, Oswald signed a

promissory note at the Embassy for a repatriation loan of $435.71.808

He and his family boarded a train for Holland,809 which passed through

Minsk that night.810 They crossed the Soviet frontier at Brest on June

2. Two days later, they departed from Holland on the SS <em>Maasdam</em>. 811

Onboard ship, the Oswalds stayed by themselves; Marina testified that

she did not often go on deck because she was poorly dressed and Oswald

was ashamed of her.812



</p><p>Probably while he was on board the <em>Maasdam</em> Oswald wrote some notes

on ship stationery, which appear to be a summary of what he thought he

had learned by living under both the capitalist and Communist systems.

The notes reflect his unhappy and deepening feeling of disillusionment

with both the Soviet Union and the United States. Oswald observed that

although reform groups may oppose the government in power, they always

declare that they are for their people and their country, and he asked

what "would happen if somebody was to stand up and say he was utterly

opposed not, only to the governments, but to the people, too the

entire land and complete foundations" of his society. He condemned

existing political groups and proposed the formation of a third choice

between communism and capitalism. neither of which was acceptable to

him. "I have lived," he said, under both systems I have sought  the

answers and although it would

</p><p><strong>Page 713</strong>

</p><p>be very easy to dupe myself into believing one system is better than

the other, I know they are not." In these notes, he acknowledged that

his "Red Cross" subsidy had been paid by the Soviet Government rather

than the international organization, and said, "I shall never sell

myself intentionlly, or unintentionlly to anyone again."

(Commission Exhibit No. 25, p. 273.) It was probably also onboard ship

that Oswald wrote two sets of answers to questions which he

anticipated about his decision to go to Russia. and later to return to

the United States. Although the sets of answers are somewhat similar,

but the tone of one is apologetic, while the other suggests that

Oswald went to Russia to study the Soviet system, but remained a loyal

American and owed no apologies.814

</p><p>The Maasdam landed at Hoboken, N.J., on June 13.815 The Oswalds

were met by Spas T. Raikin, a representative of the Traveler's Aid

Society, which had been contacted by the Department of State; Raikin

had the impression that Oswald was trying to avoid meeting anyone. He

told Raikin that he had only $63 and had no plans either for that

night or for travel to Fort Worth, and accepted the society's help,

according to Raikin, "with confidence and appreciation."816 They

passed through the immigration office without incident,817 and Raikin

helped them through customs.818

</p><p>The society referred the Oswalds to the New York City Department

of Welfare, which helped them find a room at the Times Square

Hotel.819 Oswald told both Raikin and representatives of the welfare

department that he had been a marine stationed at the American Embassy

in Moscow, had married a Russian girl, renounced his citizenship, and

worked in Minsk; he soon found out, he said, that the Russian

propaganda was inaccurate but had not been able to obtain an exit visa

for his wife and child for more than 2 years. He said also that he had

paid the travel expenses himself.820

</p><p>The welfare department called Robert Oswald's home in Fort Worth.

His wife answered and said that they would help. She contacted her

husband who sent $200 immediately.821 Oswald refused to accept the

money and insisted that the department itself should pay the fare to

Texas; he threatened that they would go as far as they could on $63

and rely on local authorities to get them the rest of the way. In the

end he accepted the money.822 On the afternoon of June 14, the Oswalds

left New York by plane for Fort Worth.823

</p><p><a href="appendix-13.html#top" name="fort">Return to Top</a></p><p><strong>FORT WORTH, DALLAS, NEW ORLEANS</strong>

</p><p>Oswald had originally indicated that he and his family would stay

with his mother in Vernon, Tex.824 His decision to stay with Robert

Oswald in Fort Worth apparently had been prompted by his brother's

invitation in a letter to him in Russia.825 Oswald listed only his

brother as a relative on an "Intake Interview" form which he prepared

for the New York Department of Welfare.826

</p><p><strong>Page 714</strong>

</p><p>Robert took his wife and children to Love Field, the Dallas

airport, to meet Lee and Marina and their baby, June Lee.827 He

testified that the most noticeable change in his brother's appearance

was that he had become rather bald; he seemed also to be somewhat

thinner than he had been in 1959. Robert thought that his brother had

picked up "something of an accent" but, except for these changes was

"the same boy" whom he had known before.828 Lee commented on the

absence of newspaper reporters and seemed to Robert to be disappointed

that none had appeared.829 Later on, Lee was anxious to avoid

publicity.830

</p><p>Robert drove the Oswalds to his home at 7313 Davenport Street.831

For a few days, Lee seemed tense,832 but the brothers got along

well,833 and to Robert it was "more or less ... [as if Lee] had not

been to Russia"; they were "just together again." 834 They did not

discuss politics, according to Robert because of a "tacit agreement"

between them.835 Lee indicated to his brother that he hoped to have

his undesirable discharge from the Marines corrected.836 Robert and

his wife "took to Marina and June," and enjoyed showing Marina "things

that she had never seen before." 837 Marina rested and took care of

her baby, and when she could, helped in the household.838 She

testified that, apart from a trip to the library, Lee spent about a

week "merely talking." 839

</p><p>On June 18, 4 days after he arrived in Fort Worth, Oswald went to

the office of Mrs. Pauline Virginia Bates, a public stenographer whose

name he had found in the telephone directory,840 and asked her to type

a manuscript from the "scraps of paper," on which he had recorded his

impressions of the Soviet Union.841 Intrigued by his tale that he had

just returned from the Soviet Union and had smuggled his notes out of

that country, she agreed to type the notes for $1 per page or $2 an

hour, 50 cents less than her usual hourly rate.842 On that day and the

succeeding 2 days, Mrs. Bates spent 8 hours typing for Oswald while he

remained in her office helping her with the notes and translating

portions of them which were in Russian.843 At the end of each session

he collected his notes and as much of the manuscript as she had done

and took them away with him.844 On June 20, he gave Mrs. Bates $10 for

the 10 completed pages; he told her that he had no more money and

refused to accept her offer to postpone pay-merit or continue the work

for nothing.845

</p><p>Oswald told Mrs. Bates that there was an engineer in Fort Worth

who wanted to help him publish his notes.846 On June 19,847 he had

called Peter Gregory, a petroleum engineer who was born in Siberia and

taught Russian at the Fort Worth Public Library as a "civic

enterprise." 848 He asked if Gregory could give him a letter

testifying to his ability to read and speak Russian, so that he could

obtain work as an interpreter or translator. Gregory suggested that

Oswald come to his office, where Gregory opened a Russian book at

random and asked Oswald to read from it. Oswald read well, and Gregory

gave him the letter he wanted.849 Gregory and Oswald had lunch

together and discussed Oswald's life in the Soviet Union,850 but,

according to Gregory's testimony, nothing was said about publishing

Oswald's

</p><p><strong>Page 715</strong></p><p>

manuscript.851 About a week later, Gregory and his son Paul, a college

student, visited the Oswalds at Robert Oswald's home and arranged for

Marina to give Paul lessons in Russian during the summer.852

</p><p>On June 26, Oswald was interviewed by FBI agents in Fort Worth.853

One of the agents who interviewed him described him as tense and

"drawn up"; he said that Oswald "exhibited an arrogant attitude ...

and [was] inclined to be just a little insolent." 854 Oswald declined

to say why he had gone to Russia, saying that he refused to "relive

the past." 855 He said that he had not attempted to obtain Soviet

citizenship, had not been approached by Soviet officials for

information about his experiences in the Marines, and had not offered

them such information. Marina's Soviet passport required her to notify

the Soviet Embassy in Washington of her address in this country, and

Oswald told the agents that he planned to contact the Embassy for this

purpose within a few days.856 He promised to notify the FBI if he were

contacted by Soviet agents "under suspicious circumstances or

otherwise."857 Oswald told his brother about the interview, saying

that it had been "just fine." 858

</p><p>Oswald and his family remained with Robert for about a month.859

While they were there his mother moved to Fort Worth from Crowell,

Tex.,860 and sometime in July they moved into her apartment at 1501

West Seventh Street.861 Mrs. Oswald testified that she had visited

them at Robert's house in June 862 and moved to Fort Worth because she

thought that the house was too crowded and wanted to help them.863

Mrs. Oswald described the period when her son and his family lived

with her as "a very happy month"; according to her testimony, she and

her son and daughter-in-law got along well. She mentioned that she not

only helped Marina keep house and care for the baby but also aided her

son in his efforts to find employment.864 Marina testified, however,



that Lee did not get along well with his mother and that he decided

after several weeks that they should move to their own apartment.855

He did not file a change-of-address card at the post office when the

family moved to West Seventh Street, as he did when they made their

next move,866 so he may have contemplated from the beginning that they

would stay with his mother for only a short while. Around the middle

of August,867 the Oswalds moved to a one-bedroom furnished apartment

at 2703 Mercedes Street, for which they paid $59.50 in advance for 1

month's rent.868

</p><p>In the third week in July, Oswald had obtained a job as a sheet

metal worker with the Louv-R-Pak Division of the Leslie Welding

Co.,869 a manufacturer of louvers and ventilators,870 to which he had

been referred by the Texas Employment Commission.871 On his

application for employment, filled out several days before, he wrote

falsely that he had experience as a sheet metal worker and

machinist in the Marines and had been honorably discharged.872 He

usually worked 8 or 9 hours a day, for which he was paid $1.25 an

hour.873 Marina testified that Oswald did not like his work,874 but he

was regarded as a good employee 875 and remained with the company

until October,</p><p>

<strong>Page 716</strong></p><p>



when he quit.876 On the job, he kept to himself and was considered

uncommunicative.877

</p><p>Mrs. Oswald visited her son and his family at their apartment and

tried to help them get settled; she testified that she bought some

clothes for Marina and a highchair for the baby but that Oswald told

her that he did not want her to buy "things for his wife that he

himself could not buy." 878 Finally, Oswald apparently decided that he

did not want his mother to visit the apartment anymore and he became

incensed when his wife permitted her to visit despite his

instructions.879 After he moved to Dallas in October, Oswald did not

see his mother or communicate with her in any way until she came to

see him after the assassination.880 Witnesses have described the

Mercedes Street apartment as "decrepit" and very poorly furnished;

881 there was no telephone service.882 Acquaintances observed that

Marina and the baby were poorly clothed, that the Oswalds had little

food, and that at first there was not a bed for the baby.883

</p><p>On August 16, the FBI again interviewed Oswald. This interview

took place in the back seat of a car in front of his home and covered

substantially the same material as the previous interview. Oswald

again denied having made any deal with representatives of the Soviet

Union. He protested his undesirable discharge from the Marines, and

stated that his wife was registered at the Soviet Embassy. He still

refused to discuss why he had gone to the Soviet Union, but he was

less hostile than he had been during the previous interview.884

According to his wife, however, he was very upset by the interest the

FBI showed in him.885

</p><p>The Oswalds became acquainted with a growing number of people of

the Russian-speaking community in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, who were

tied together socially by a common origin, language, and religion. The

group was not restricted to people from Russia but was composed

primarily of people from Eastern European countries.886 The Oswalds'

initial contact with this group was through Peter Gregory. Marina gave

conversational Russian lessons to Paul Gregory 2 days a week during

August and early September, for which she was paid $35. Most of the

lessons took place at the Mercedes Street apartment and Oswald was

generally present.887 In addition, Paul Gregory occasionally took the

Oswalds shopping; after they became friendly, he had a number of

discussions with Oswald, some of them politically oriented.888

</p><p>Sometime around August 25, Peter Gregory invited the Oswalds and

several members of the Russian community to his house for dinner. One

of the guests was George Bouhe, a Dallas accountant and a leader of

the Russian community. He was very interested in meeting and


conversing with Marina, because she had spent much of her life in

Leningrad, which was his birthplace.889 Also present was Mrs. Anna

Meller, the Russian- born wife of a Dallas department store

employee.890 Near the end of August, the Oswalds met Declan Ford, a

consulting geologist in the Dallas area, and his Russian-born wife at

Mrs. Meller's home. The Oswalds were also introduced to Mrs.

</p><p><strong>Page 717</strong>

</p><p>Elena Hall, who was born in Tehran, Iran, of Russian parentage. She

worked in a dental laboratory and at this time was divorced from her

former husband John Hall, whom she subsequently remarried. In order to

obtain dental aid for Marina, George Bouhe had brought her to Mrs.

Hall's house.891 In early September, the Oswalds met Alexander

Kleinlerer, another member of the Russian group, who was then courting

Mrs. Hall.892 Mrs. Max Clark was introduced to Marina during this

period by George Bouhe and Anna Meller. Max Clark met the Oswalds at a

later time.893 At about the same time, they were visited by George De

Mohrenschildt, a petroleum engineer born in Russia.894 who had heard

of them from one of the Russian-speaking group.895 Later on, the

Oswalds met his wife, Jeanne, and his daughter and son-in-law, Gary

and Alexandra Taylor.896

</p><p>Most of the members of the Russian community were interested in

the Oswalds not only because they needed help, but also because they

could provide the latest information about what was happening in

Russia.897 Some members of the group were at first apprehensive about

them because the apparent ease with which they had left Russia seemed

suspicious.898 Nevertheless, many of the group provided small amounts

of money, groceries, clothing, and furniture for the Oswalds; George

Bouhe, Anna Meller, and Elena Hall were the primary contributors,

although others provided help in the form of transportation and

groceries.899 These acquaintances occasionally visited the Oswalds,

and the Oswalds in turn visited some of them in Dallas.900

</p><p>It was evident that Oswald did not appreciate the help of the

Russian community.901 At least once he flew into a rage and shouted

that he did not need any of the things that people were giving to

him.902 Some felt that he resented the gifts because he could not give

his wife what the others were providing;903 he apparently was critical

of them also because he felt that they were overly concerned with

improving themselves economically.904

</p><p>Oswald became increasingly unpopular with his Russian-speaking

acquaintances, partly because of his resentment of their

assistance.905 Alexander Kleinlerer stated that none of them cared for

Oswald "because of his political philosophy, his criticism of the

United States, his apparent lack of interest in anyone but himself and

because of his treatment of Marina."906 Some of them believed that

Oswald was mentally disturbed.907 However, they felt sorry for Marina

and the child and continued to help.908

</p><p>On a weekend afternoon early in October, the Oswalds were visited

by his mother and a number of people from the Russian community,

including George Bouhe, Anna Meller, the Halls, the De Mohrenschildts,

and the Taylors.909 Oswald had apparently decided to look for a new

job, and discussed his lack of job prospects and the fact that his

rent was overdue.910 He was advised to seek employment in the Dallas

area.911 Elena Hall invited Marina to move into her house in Fort

Worth until Oswald found a job in Dallas. She accepted the proposal,

and Mrs. Hall moved Marina. her daughter June, and the

</p><p><strong>Page 718</strong>

</p><p>Oswalds' few household goods in a pickup truck belonging to the dental

laboratory where she was employed.912

</p><p>Oswald worked at the Leslie Welding Co. on Monday, October 8, but

failed to appear on the following day. He was already in Dallas.913 He

falsely told his wife that he had been discharged,914 and told George

Bouhe that the job had been a temporary one.915 Sometime later, the

company received an undated letter from him stating that he had "moved

permanently to Dallas," and asking that the wages due him be forwarded

to him at box 2915 in Dallas.916 He did not tell his mother that he

was leaving Fort Worth.917

</p><p>While they were in Fort Worth, the Oswalds were having marital

problems.918 Several people noted that Marina had a blackened eye when

they visited her at the Mercedes Street apartment.919 She told her

mother-in-law and George Bouhe that her husband had struck her, but

said to Anna Meller that she had walked into a door.920 It seems clear

that Oswald had in fact hit her.921 People observed friction between

the Oswalds on various occasions,922 although their disputes became

more apparent later. Marina has written that this was a difficult

period for them and that her husband was "very irritable" and

sometimes some completely trivial thing would "drive him into a rage."

923

</p><p>She testified that:</p>

    <blockquote>... immediately after coming to the United States Lee changed. I did

not know him as such a man in Russia. ... He helped me as before,

but he became a little more of a recluse ... He was very irritable,

sometimes for a trifle ... 924</blockquote>


<p>
She has denied, however, that their separation was the result of

quarrels between them.925

</p><p>Marina spent the first few weeks after Oswald's departure at Elena

Hall's house in Fort Worth, except for a brief stay at Gary Taylor's

house in Dallas after one of her appointments at the Baylor Dental

Clinic.926 While she was in Dallas, Mrs. De Mohrenschildt brought her

to the clinic on October 8, October 10, and October 15; 927 George

Bouhe had given Mrs. De Mohrenschildt the money to cover the expense

of Marina's dental care.928

</p><p>Even before Oswald went to Dallas, some of his acquaintances were

helping him in his effort to find a job there.929 George De

Mohrenschildt directed him to Samuel B. Ballen, a Dallas financial

consultant, but no employment resulted.930 George Bouhe recommended

that Oswald go to the Texas Employment Commission in Dallas; and Anna

Meller had her husband ask Mrs. Helen Cunningham, a counselor in the

clerical and sales division of the Dallas office of the employment

commission, to help Oswald find a job.931 Oswald first came into the

office of the employment commission on October 9. He was reluctant to

accept industrial employment, and was placed in the clerical category

and turned over to Mrs. Cunningham for counseling. He

</p><p><strong>Page 719</strong>

</p><p>indicated that he had an interest in writing. The results of general

aptitude tests which he had taken at the Fort Worth employment office

had been transmitted to the Dallas office, and indicated that he had

some aptitude in this direction and for clerical work. It was noted on

his application form that he had "outstanding verbal-clerical

potential." He demonstrated ability to perform many skilled and

semi-skilled jobs, and there was some indication that he could do

college work. Mrs. Cunningham gave him three special tests: for

general clerical work, work as an insurance claims examiner, and

drafting work. He scored high on all three. His application form

indicated that he did not have a driver's license, and noted:

"well-groomed and spoken, business suit, alert replies--expresses self

extremely well." He told Mrs. Cunningham that he hoped to develop

qualifications for responsible junior executive employment by a

work-study program at a local college but that this must be delayed

because of his immediate financial needs and responsibilities.932

</p><p>Mrs. Cunningham concluded that although Oswald would be classified

for clerical work, she should try to get him any available job, since

he badly needed money. He was referred to an architect for an opening

as a messenger but was not hired. On October 11, he was referred to

Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall Co., a graphic arts company, in response to a

call from John Graef, head of the photographic department of the

company, who had told the employment commission that he needed a

photoprint trainee. Oswald was enthusiastic about his prospects and

apparently made a good impression; Graef picked him over several other

applicants.933 On the following day he began working in his new

position as a trainee making prints of advertising material. He worked

a 40-hour week at approximately $1.35 per hour; his take-home pay

varied from $49 to $74 a week.934 According to his wife, "he liked his

work very much." 935

</p><p>Oswald moved into the YMCA on October 15, and stayed there until

October 19, paying $2.25 a night.936 He had used the Taylors' address

and telephone number as a place where he could be reached,937 but on

October 9 had also rented post office box 2915 under his own name at

the main post office on Ervay Street.938 On October 10, he filed a

change-of-address form indicating that mail for 2703 Mercedes Street

should be forwarded to the box.939 Marina has written that Oswald

wrote her letters and telephoned her during the separation.940

</p><p>On October 16, Mrs Hall brought Marina and June to Dallas to have

June baptized. Marina apparently did this surreptitiously, because her

husband opposed baptism; they did not contact him in Dallas, but left

birthday gifts for him at the Taylors. Oswald did not appear very

disturbed when he found out about the baptism.941

</p><p>Two days later, Mrs. Hall had an automobile accident and went to

the hospital, where she remained until October 26; Marina remained in

the Hall house. Mrs. Max Clark and Alexander Kleinlerer, a friend of

Mrs. Hall, checked up to make sure that she was getting

</p><p><strong>Page 720</strong>

</p><p>along without too much trouble.942 After Oswald left the YMCA on

October 19, he moved to a room or apartment somewhere in Dallas,943

which has not been located.944 It seems likely, however, that during

that time he spent several weekends with Marina at the Hall house.945

</p><p>Four days after Mrs. Hall returned from the hospital, she left for

New York to visit friends. By the time she returned, Marina had moved

to a three-room apartment at 604 Elsbeth Street in Dallas, which

Oswald had rented on Saturday, November 3; 946 the landlady stated

that he had looked at the apartment about a week before. The monthly

rent was $68, in addition to which he had to pay several dollars a

month for utilities. He paid the rent plus a $5 deposit on November

3,947 but probably spent that night with Marina at the Hall house. On

Sunday the Taylors helped the Oswalds move their belongings to the

Elsbeth Street apartment with a rented trailer.948 Oswald had asked

Kleinlerer to help them move, and Kleinlerer also was present when

they departed.949

</p><p>Soon after the Oswalds were reunited, their marital difficulties

started again. While they were moving to Elsbeth Street, Kleinlerer

noticed that Oswald slapped his wife for not having the zipper on her

dress completely closed.950 They argued over his refusal to allow her

to smoke.951 There was a quarrel also when he told the landlady that

Marina was from Czechoslovakia; he was angered when Marina, who

disapproved of this deception, told the landlady the truth.952

</p><p>Although several people tried to help Marina improve her scanty

knowledge of English, Oswald discouraged this,953 perhaps because he

wanted to keep up his Russian.954 Some witnesses testified that she

commented about his sexual abilities.955 He apparently continued to

beat her, and once she suggested to George De Mohrenschildt that she

should "get away" from Oswald. When De Mohrenschildt criticized

Oswald's conduct, Oswald replied, "It is my business."956 Marina

testified that when they moved into the Elsbeth Street apartment, her

husband became "nervous and irritable" and was very angry over

"trifles." 957 She said that it was sometimes her fault that he beat

her,958 for example when she wrote to an old boyfriend in Russia that

she wished she had married him; the letter was returned for postage

due, and Oswald read it.959

</p><p>Because of this quarreling, a few of their acquaintances felt that

Marina would be better off alone. George Bouhe offered to help her if

she promised to leave Oswald permanently.960 Finally, in early

November, Marina, helped by the De Mohrenschildts, moved into Anna

Meller's house with the intention not to return to Oswald. He was

apparently quite upset and did not want Marina to leave him.961

</p><p>Oswald did not visit his wife at Anna Meller's house,962 and for a

short time did not even know where she was.963 According to Marina, he

called her after she moved and they met at De Mohrenschildt's house.

He asked her to return home. She insisted that he stop quarreling and

that he change his ways. He said that he could not change. Marina

would not agree to return home with him and he left.964

</p><p><strong>Page 721</strong>

</p><p>Marina was uncomfortable at the Meller house, where there was very

little room. She moved to Katherine Ford's house 965 where she

apparently stayed from November 11 to 17. She indicated that she had

decided never to return to her husband; 966 it was Mrs. Ford's

impression that Marina was going to stay at other people's houses

until a permanent place could be found for her.967 When Mr. Ford

returned from a business trip on November 17, Marina and June moved to

the home of Mrs. Frank Ray, where they spent the day. Mrs. Ray, the

wife of a Dallas advertising man, was also of Russian origin. Since

Mrs. Ray had no baby bed, Marina returned to the Fords that evening.

On the next day, however, Marina moved her belongings to the Rays'

house. That same day, Oswald called and asked to visit his wife, whom

he had called and written. Mr. Ray picked him up and took him to

Marina.968

</p><p>Marina testified that at this meeting Oswald professed his love

for her. She stated: "I saw him cry ... [he] begged me to come back,

asked my forgiveness, and promised that he would try to improve, if

only I would come back." 969 On another occasion she said: "... he

cried and you know a woman's heart--I went back to him. He said he

didn't care to live if I did not return? 970 That same day she decided

to return to him. Mr. Ray packed her belongings and took her back to

the Elsbeth Street apartment.971

</p><p>Members of the Russian community who had taken care of Marina so

that she would not have to live with Oswald felt that their efforts

had been in vain. George Bouhe was so irritated that he never again

tried to help either of the Oswalds.972 Contacts between them and

members of the Russian community diminished markedly.973 Oswald did

not care for most of these people and made his feelings apparent.974

Even the De Mohrenschildts, whom he liked most, saw much less of

them.975 Lydia Dymitruk, another Russian born woman in the Dallas-Fort

Worth area, testified that she saw the Oswalds on only one occasion,

and did not care to see them again. She drove Marina and June, who had

a high fever, to the hospital; Oswald told the hospital that he was

unemployed in order to avoid paying for June's treatment and later

left Mrs. Dymitruk without thanking her.976 Mrs. Ford testified that

Marina had told her that she contemplated suicide during this period

because Oswald was treating her badly and she had no friends; she felt

that she had "no way out." 977 Marina acknowledged to the Commission

that she had such thoughts.978

</p><p>In an effort to renew family ties, Robert Oswald wrote to Lee and

John Pic on November 17, inviting them and their families to

Thanksgiving dinner. Lee accepted the invitation. He and Marina

traveled to Fort Worth by bus on Thanksgiving Day, and John Pic and

Robert met them at the station.979 Pic had not seen his half-brother

for 10 years. He observed, as many others have also attested, that Lee

seemed to be a good father and to take an active interest in June.980

After dinner, Marina phoned Paul Gregory, who later drove the Oswalds

to his house for sandwiches and then took them to the bus station for

the return trip to Dallas.981 Thereafter, Robert spoke to his

</p><p><strong>Page 722</strong>

</p><p>brother once by telephone and received a post card and a letter from

him, but he eventually lost contact with Lee and did not see him again

until after the assassination.982

</p><p>Despite his disillusionment with Soviet life, Oswald kept up his

interest in Russia. He wrote to the Soviet Embassy in Washington for

information on how to subscribe to Russian periodicals and for "any

periodicals or bulletins which you may put out for the benefit of your

citizens living, for a time, in the U.S.A." 983 He subsequently

subscribed to several Russian journals.984 In December 1962, the

Soviet Embassy received a card in Russian, signed "Marina and Lee

Oswald," which conveyed New Year's greetings and wishes for "health,

success and all of the best" to the employees at the Embassy.985 The

Oswalds continued to correspond with acquaintances in Russia.986

</p><p>Soon after his return to this country, Oswald had started to

correspond with the Communist Party, U.S.A., and the Socialist Workers

Party. He subscribed to the Worker in August 1962.987  He wrote for

additional literature from these organizations, and attempted to join

the Socialist Workers Party, which, however, had no branch in

Texas.988 He sent samples of his photographic work to the Socialist

Workers Party, the Worker, and the Hall-Davis Defense Committee, and

offered to aid them in printing and photographic work in connection

with posters; these offers were not accepted.989

</p><p>He continued to read a great deal on a variety of subjects.990

George Bouhe testified that Oswald's fare consisted of books by Marx,

Lenin, "and similar things." 991 Marina said that he read books of a

historical nature, including H. G. Wells' two volume "Outline of

History," and biographies of Hitler, Kennedy, and Khrushchev.992

</p><p>Despite the Oswalds' break with the Russian community, De

Mohrenschildt, knowing that they would be alone during the Christmas

season, asked the Fords whether he could bring the Oswalds to a party

celebrating the Russian Christmas at the Fords' home; the Fords

assented. The party was attended by many members of the Russian

community.993 Oswald spoke at length with Yaeko Okui, a Japanese woman

who had been brought to the party by Lev Aronson, first cellist of the

Dallas Symphony Orchestra; 994 she told Federal investigators that she

never saw Oswald again.995 The Oswalds were not invited to three other

Russian Christmas season gatherings which occurred during the next few

days.996

</p><p>Marina visited the De Mohrenschildts several times after

Christmas.997 They invited both Lee and Marina to a small dinner party

in February 1963; also present were Everett Glover, a chemist employed

in Dallas, and his roommate Volkmar Schmidt.998 On February 22, Glover

had a gathering at his house, one of the purposes of which was to

permit his friends, many of whom were studying Russian, to meet the

Oswalds.999 They were the objects of much attention.1000 Marina

conversed at length with another guest named Ruth Paine, who had

recently separated from her husband, Michael Paine, a research

engineer at the Bell Helicopter plant in Fort Worth. Mrs. Paine, who

was studying Russian, obtained Marina's address 1001 and

</p><p><strong>Page 723</strong>

</p><p>shortly thereafter wrote Marina asking to see her. Marina responded by

inviting Mrs. Paine to visit her.1002

</p><p>The Oswalds moved out of their Elsbeth Street apartment on March

3, 1963, to an upstairs apartment several blocks away at 214 West

Neely Street. Oswald inquired about the apartment in response to a

"For Rent" sign; the rent was $60 per month, not including

utilities.1003 They moved without assistance, carrying their

belongings in their hands and in a baby stroller.1004 Marina preferred

the Neely Street apartment because it had a porch and was, she felt,

more suitable for June.1005


</p><p>Aware of Oswald's difficulties in obtaining employment, George

Bouhe had advised him as early as October 1962 to attend a night

school in Dallas.1006 On January 14, Oswald enrolled in a typing

course in the night school of Crozier Technical High School, and

started attending on January 28. The class ran from 6:15 to 7:15 p.m.

on Mondays, Tuesday, and Thursdays. Although Oswald reviewed a typing

textbook at home, he attended the course irregularly and stopped going

altogether on about March 28.1007

</p><p>Ruth Paine and Marina started to exchange visits in March. Mrs.

Paine invited the Oswalds for dinner, and on April 20 she took them on

a picnic. When Oswald was not present, the two women frequently

discussed their respective marital problems, and Marina disclosed to

Mrs. Paine that she was pregnant.1008 Marina wrote of these meetings:</p>

    <blockquote>One day we were invited to a friend's house, where I met Ruth

Paine, who was studying Russian here in America and wanted to improve

her conversational knowledge. We began to see each other. Ruth would

come to see me with her children. This was very good for both me and

for June. She was growing up alone and becoming terribly wild, so the

company of other children was good for her. Sometimes we went out on

picnics at a nearby lake. Lee loved to fish, and we would look and

rejoice if he caught a little fish. Several times we went to visit

Ruth who lived in Irving.1009</blockquote>


<p>
Using the name of A. J. Hidell, Oswald had ordered a Smith &amp;

Wesson .38 revolver from Los Angeles on a form which he dated January

27. On March 12, he ordered a rifle from Klein's Sporting Goods in

Chicago under the name of A. Hidell.1010 Oswald used the name "Alek

James Hidell" on identification cards which he probably produced at

Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall. One of his fellow employees taught him various

photographic techniques, which he could have used to prepare not only

these cards, but also the samples of his work which he sent to various

organizations.1011

</p><p>Both weapons were shipped on March 20.1012 Oswald kept the rifle

in a small storeroom at the Neely Street apartment. He spent long

periods of time in the storeroom, which he told Marina she was not to

enter.1013 He told her that he intended to use the rifle for hunt-

</p><p><strong>Page 724</strong>

</p><p>ing 1014 and that he practiced with it. She saw him leave with it

once, and clean it several times.1015 He also posed for two pictures,

taken by Marina in the backyard of the Neely apartment, in which he

held his rifle and copies of the Worker and the Militant and the

revolver was strapped to his belt. He gave one of the pictures to his

wife and asked her to keep it for June.1016

</p><p>Over the weekend of March 9-10, Oswald photographed the alley

which runs behind the home of Gen. Edwin Walker, and probably at about

the same time he photographed the rear of Walker's home and a nearby

railroad track and right-of-way.1017 He prepared and studied a

notebook in which he outlined a plan to shoot General Walker, and he

looked at bus schedules.1018 He went to the Walker residence on the

evening of April 6 or 7, planning to make his attack. However, he

changed his plans, hid his rifle nearby, and determined to act on the

following Wednesday, April 10, when a nearby church was planning a

meeting which, Oswald reasoned, would create a diversion that would

help him escape.1019 On Wednesday, Oswald left a note for Marina

telling her what to do if he were apprehended. He retrieved his rifle

and fired at Walker, but the bullet narrowly missed Walker's head.

Oswald secreted his rifle again and took the bus home.1020

</p><p>When Oswald told Marina what he had done, she became angry and

made him promise never to repeat such an act. She testified that she

kept his letter, intending to give it to the authorities if he

repeated his attempt. He told Marina that he was sorry he had missed

Walker and said that the shooting of Walker would have been analogous

to an assassination of Hitler.1021 Several days later, the De

Mohrenschildts visited the Oswalds, bringing an Easter present for

June. During the visit, Jeanne De Mohrenschildt saw the rifle and told

her husband about it. Without any knowledge of the truth, De

Mohrenschildt jokingly intimated that Oswald was the one who had shot

at Walker. Oswald apparently concluded that Marina had told De

Mohrenschildt of his role in the attempt and was visibly shaken.1022

</p><p>On April 6, Oswald was dropped by Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall because,

in his supervisor's opinion, he could not do the work, although he was

trying; in addition, he did not get along with his fellow

employees.1023 The fact that he brought a Russian newspaper to work

may also have been of some significance.1024 Marina testified that her

husband, who had always worried about his job security at

Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall,1025 was quite upset by the loss of his job

since he had liked the work.1026

</p><p>Oswald again resorted to the Texas Employment Commission.1027 On

April 8, he informed the Commission that he was seeking employment but

was referred to no employers. He stated that he had been laid off at

Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall due to lack of work." 1028 On April 12, he made

a claim for unemployment benefits; 4 days later the commission mailed

him a determination disapproving his claim because of insufficient

wage credits.1029

</p><p>For a while after the Oswalds moved into the Neely Street

apartment they got along well,1030 but they soon began to quarrel.1031

</p><p><strong>Page 725</strong>

</p><p>Oswald was apparently still preventing Marina from learning

English,1032 and there is some indication that he continued to beat

her.1033 Since February, he had been urging her to return to

Russia.1034 Marina wrote several letters to the Russian Embassy

requesting a visa to return to Russia.; 1035 she testified, however,

that Oswald forced her to write them, and that she never wanted to

return to Russia.1036

</p><p>When Ruth Paine visited the Oswalds at their apartment on April

24, she was surprised to learn that Oswald was packed and ready to

leave for New Orleans by bus. He explained that he had been unable to

find employment in or around Dallas, and that Marina had suggested

that he go to New Orleans since he had been born there.1037 Marina has

testified that the real reason behind her suggestion was that she

wanted to get him out of town because of the Walker incident.1038 Mrs.

Paine offered to drive Marina to New Orleans at a later date, and also

to have Marina and June stay with her rather than at the apartment in

the meantime. Oswald helped the women pack Mrs. Paine's car, and the

two women moved everything from the Neely Street apartment to the

Paine house in Irving.1039

</p><p>When he arrived at the bus station in New Orleans, Oswald

telephoned his aunt, Lillian Murret, to ask if he could stay at her

home at 757 French Street while he looked for employment. She had been

unaware that he had returned from Russia or that he was married and

had a child and was surprised to hear from him. She said that she did

not have room to accommodate three guests, but that since he was

alone he was welcome.1040

</p><p>Oswald had been born in New Orleans, and on his return showed

great interest in finding out what had happened to the other members

of his father's family. He visited the cemetery where his father was

buried and called all the Oswalds in the telephone book. By this

method he located one relative, Mrs. Hazel Oswald of Metairie, La.,

the widow of William Stout Oswald, his father's brother. He visited

her at her home; she gave him a picture of his father and told him

that as far as she knew the rest of the family was dead.1041

</p><p>On April 26, Oswald began his search for employment. He went to

the employment office of the Louisiana Department of Labor and stated

that he was qualified as a commercial photographer, shipping clerk, or

"darkroom man." The interviewer noted on Oswald's application card:

"Will travel on limited basis. Will relocate. Min. $1.25 hr. Neat.

Suit. Tie. Polite." 1042 Although the employment commission made a few

referrals, Oswald relied primarily upon newspaper advertisements, and

applied for a number of positions.1043 Mrs. Murret testified that he

would spend the day job hunting, return to her home for supper, watch

television, and go to bed.1044

</p><p>On April 29, he filed a request for reconsideration of the

employment commission's disapproval of his unemployment compensation

claim. His complaint that he had not been credited for his employment

at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall was ruled valid on May 8, and he was

granted maximum benefits of $369, payable at the rate of $33 per week.

He filed interstate claims on May 7 and 15, and received

</p><p><strong>Page 726</strong>

</p><p>$33 in response to the latter; the former claim was filed before the

expiration of the prescribed wailing period.1045 Not only had Oswald

in fact been working since May 10, but he included on his claim sheet,

as concerns with which he had sought work, fictitious employers and

employers whom he apparently had not contacted.1046

</p><p>Oswald wrote to Marina: "All is well. I am living with Aunt

Lillian. She has very kindly taken us in. I am now looking for work.

When I find it I will write you." 1047 And on May 3, he wrote to

Marina and Ruth Paine: "Girls, I still have not found work, but I

receive money from the unemployment office in the amount 15 to 20

dollars. They were mistaken in the Dallas office when they refused,

but I straightened everything out. Uncle 'Dyuz' offered me a loan of

$200.00 if needed. Great, eh?!" 1018

</p><p>On May 9, responding to a newspaper advertisement, Oswald

completed an application for employment with William B. Reily Co.,

Inc., at 640 Magazine Street, an enterprise engaged in the roasting,

grinding, canning, bagging, and sale of coffee. On his application

form, Oswald listed as references in addition to John Murret, "Sgt.

Robert Hidell" and "Lieut. J. Evans," both apparently fictitious

names.1049 His application was approved and he began work on May 10,

at the rate of $1.50 per hour. His task was the lubrication of the

company's machinery.1050 Oswald did not enjoy this work,1051 and told

his wife and Mrs. Paine that he was working in commercial

photography.1052

</p><p>Also on May 9, Oswald obtained an apartment at 4905 Magazine

Street with the help of Myrtle Evans, who had known him when he was a

child. The rent was $65 a month. Oswald moved in on May 10,1053 after

telephoning Marina on the ninth and asking her to come to New Orleans.

Ruth Paine testified that the invitation elated Marina: "Papa nas

lubet"--"Daddy loves us," she repeated again and again. Mrs. Paine

drove Marina and June to New Orleans; they left Dallas on May 10,

spent the night in Shreveport, and arrived on the 11th. Mrs. Paine

stayed with the Oswalds for 8 days; the three of them, with June and

Mrs. Paine's children, toured the French Quarter. On May 14, Mrs.

Paine left New Orleans to return to her home.1054

</p><p>The Murrets and the Oswalds exchanged visits from time to time;

Marina testified that the Murrets were very good to them.1055 Mrs.

Murret's daughter, Marilyn, took the Oswalds on an outing.1056 But,

according to Marina's testimony, aside from Ruth Paine and Ruth

Kloepfer and her daughters, the Murrets were the only social visitors

the Oswalds had.1057 Ruth Kloepfer was a clerk of the Quaker Meeting

in New Orleans whom Ruth Paine had written in the hope that she might

know some Russian-speaking people who could visit Marina. Mrs.

Kloepfer herself visited the Oswalds but made no attempt to direct any

Russian-speaking people to them.1058

</p><p>On July 19, Oswald was dismissed by Reily because of inefficiency

and inattention to his work. He had spent many of his working hours

next door at the Crescent City Garage, where he read gun magazines and

discussed guns with one of the owners, Adrian Alba.1059 On the

</p><p><strong>Page 727</strong>

</p><p>following Monday, July 22, Oswald again visited the Louisiana

employment office to seek new employment and file a claim for

unemployment compensation. Thereafter, he collected unemployment

compensation weekly and, although apparently making some effort to

obtain another job, again listed a number of fictitious job

applications on his unemployment compensation claim forms.1060 He soon

gave up his search for employment, and began to spend his days at home

reading.1061 He received another setback on July 25, when he was

notified that in response to the request for review which he had made

in 1962, his undesirable discharge from the Marine Corps had been

affirmed.1062

</p><p>During this period, Oswald began to evidence thoughts of returning

to the Soviet Union or going to Cuba. On June 24 he applied for a new

passport, which he received on the following day.1063 Apparently at

Oswald's request,1064 Marina wrote to the Russian Embassy, expressing

a desire to return to Russia and indicating that she would be

accompanied by her husband. She explained that she wanted to return

because of family problems, including the impending birth of her

second child.1065 Accompanying her letter was a letter written by

Oswald dated July 1, in which he asked the Embassy to rush an entrance

visa for his wife and requested that his visa be considered

separately.1066 Marina believed that Oswald was really planning to go

only to Cuba.1067 She testified that "his basic desire was to get to

Cuba by any means, and that all the rest of it was window dressing for

that purpose." 1068

</p><p>During the early days of the New Orleans period, the Oswalds'

marriage was more harmonious than it had been previously. Marina

wrote:</p>

    <blockquote>... our family life in New Orleans was more peaceful. Lee took great

satisfaction in showing me the city where he was born. We often went

to the beach, the zoo, and the park. Lee liked to go and hunt crabs.

It is true, that he was not very pleased with his job ... We did not

have very much money, and the birth of a new child involved new

expenses ... As before, Lee spent a great deal of time reading.1069</blockquote>

<p>

Marina testified, however, that after they had been in New Orleans for

a while, Oswald became depressed and that she once found him alone in

the dark crying.1070 She wrote to Ruth Paine that his "love" had

ceased soon after Mrs. Paine had left New Orleans.1071 Mrs. Paine

testified, however, that she had noticed friction between the Oswalds

before she left.1072 On July 11, Mrs. Paine wrote Marina that if

Oswald did not wish to live with her any more and preferred that she

return to the Soviet Union, she could live at the Paines' house.

Although Mrs. Paine had long entertained this idea, this was the first

time she explicitly made the invitation. She renewed the invitation on

July 12, and again on July 14; she attempted to overcome any feeling

which Marina might have that she would be a burden by stating that

</p><p><strong>Page 728</strong>

</p><p>Marina could help with the housework and help her learn Russian, and

that she would also provide a tax advantage.1073

</p><p>Marina replied that she had previously raised the subject of a

separation and that it had led to arguments. She stated that she was

happy and that for a considerable period of time Oswald had been good

to her. She attributed this improved attitude to the fact that he was

anticipating their second child. Marina turned down Mrs. Paine's

invitation but said that she would take advantage of it if things

became worse.1074 Mrs. Paine replied that she was taking a trip north

to visit her parents and would visit Marina in New Orleans about

September 18. She also suggested that Marina come to her house for the

birth of the baby.1075

</p><p>On July 6, Eugene Murret, a cousin of Oswald who was studying to

be a Jesuit Priest in Mobile, Ala., wrote and asked if Oswald could

come to Mobile and speak at the Jesuit House of Studies about

"contemporary Russia and the practice of Communism there." Oswald

accepted, and on July 27 he and his family, joined by some of the

Murrets, traveled to Mobile; Charles Murret paid the expenses. Oswald

spoke concerning his observations in Russia and conducted a question

and answer period; he impressed his listeners as articulate. He

indicated that he had become disillusioned during his stay in Russia,

and that in his opinion the best political system would be one which

combined the best points of capitalism and communism.1076  While he

left his listeners with the impression that he was an atheist, he

avoided a direct discussion of religion. The group returned to New

Orleans on July 28.1077

</p><p>In late May and early June, Oswald had apparently begun to

formulate plans for creating a New Orleans branch of the Fair Play for

Cuba Committee. Using the name "Lee Osborne" he ordered a number of

printed circulars demanding "Hands off Cuba" in large letters, and

application forms and membership cards for the proposed chapter.1078

On August 5, he visited a store managed by Carlos Bringuier, a Cuban

refugee and avid opponent of Castro and the New Orleans delegate of

the Cuban student directorate. Oswald indicated an interest in joining

the struggle against Castro. He told Bringuier that he had been a

marine and was trained in guerrilla warfare, and that he was willing

not only to train Cubans to fight Castro but also to join the fight

himself. The next day Oswald returned to the store and left his

"Guidebook for Marines" for Bringuier.1079

</p><p>On August 9, Bringuier saw Oswald passing out Fair Play for Cuba

leaflets. Bringuier and his companions became angry and a dispute

resulted. Oswald and the three Cuban exiles were arrested for

disturbing the peace.1080 Oswald spent the night in jail and was

interviewed the next day by a lieutenant of the New Orleans Police

Department. At Oswald's request, an FBI agent also interviewed him.

Oswald maintained that he was a member of the New Orleans branch of

the Fair Play for Cuba Committee which, he claimed, had 35 members. He

stated also that he had been in touch with the president of that

organization, A. J. Hidell.1081 Oswald was in fact the

</p><p><strong>Page 729</strong>

</p><p>only member of the "New Orleans branch," which had never been

chartered by the National Fair Play for Cuba Committee.1082 Later that

day Oswald was released on bail, and 2 days later he pleaded guilty to

the charges against him and paid a $10 fine. The charges against the

Cuban exiles were dismissed.1083 Marina testified that the arrest

upset Lee and that he "became less active, he cooled off a little"

after it.1084

</p><p>On August 16, Oswald, assisted by at least one other person who

was a hired helper, again passed out Fair Play for Cuba literature,

this time in front of the International Trade Mart. That night,

television newscasts ran pictures of Oswald's activities.1085 (This

hindered Oswald's subsequent attempts to obtain employment in New

Orleans.) 1086 Bringuier sent one of his friends to Oswald's home to

pose as a Castro sympathizer and attempt to obtain information about

Oswald, but Oswald apparently saw through the ruse.1087

</p><p>William Stuckey, a radio broadcaster with a program called "Latin

Listening Post," had long been looking for a member of the Fair Play

for Cuba Committee to appear on his program. He learned about Oswald

from Bringuier, and visited Oswald on August 17. Later that day,

Stuckey recorded an interview with Oswald which was 

cut to about 5 minutes and played back on the show that evening.1088

Two days later, Stuckey asked the news director of the station if he

could run the entire tape, but the director felt that a debate with a

local opponent of Castro would be of greater public interest.

Consequently, Stuckey arranged for a debate between Oswald and

Bringuier on a 25-minute daily public affairs program called

"Conversation Carte Blanche," which took place on August 21.1089

Oswald defended the Castro regime and discussed Marxism. He was put on

the defensive when his defection to Russia was brought up,1090 and

Stuckey later testified that he thought that the program had finished

the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans.1091 However, Stuckey

also testified that Oswald seemed to be a clean-cut and intelligent

person who conducted himself very well during the interviews and

debates.1092

</p><p>Oswald wrote several times to V. T. Lee, then national director of

the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, telling him, sometimes in

exaggerated terms, of his activities.1093 He wrote also to the

Communist Party and asked whether, in view of his prior defection, he

should "continue to fight, handicapped as it were, by ... [his] past

record, [and] compete with anti-progressive forces, above-ground or  ... should always remain in the background, i.e., underground." 1095

The Party replied that "often it is advisable for some people to

remain in the background, not underground." 1095 And although Oswald

wrote four letters to V. T. Lee during the summer,1096 there is no

evidence that Oswald heard from him after May 29.

</p><p>Ruth Paine arrived in New Orleans on September 20, and spent three

nights with the Oswalds. During this stay, Mrs. Paine found relations

between them much improved. Nonetheless, it was decided that Marina

would go back with her to Irving for the birth of the

</p><p><strong>Page 730</strong>

</p><p>baby.  Marina and Mrs. Paine toured Bourbon Street while Oswald stayed

home and did some packing for Marina's return to Texas.1097  On

Sunday, September 22, Oswald and Mrs. Paine finished loading the

station wagon with the Oswalds' household belongings.1098

</p><p><a href="appendix-13.html#top" name="mexico">Return to Top</a></p><p><strong>MEXICO CITY</strong>

</p><p>Marina Oswald testified that sometime in August her husband first

told her of his plan to go to Mexico and from there to Cuba, where he

planned to stay; he had given up a plan to hijack an airplane and fly

directly to Cuba, which plan Marina consistently opposed.1099 On

September 17, he obtained from the Mexican consulate general in New

Orleans a "Tourist Card," FM-8 No. 24085, good for one journey into

Mexico for no longer than 15 days. Typed in the blank, "Appelidos y

nombre" was "Lee, Harvey Oswald," "Fotogrofo"; the intended

destination was shown as Mexico City.1100 (The comma between "Lee" and

"Harvey" seems to have been an error.)1101 On the application Oswald

stated that he was employed at "640 Rampart"; he was in fact

unemployed.1102 (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 2478, 2481, p. 300.)

</p><p>Marina and June departed with Mrs. Ruth Paine for Irving on the

morning of September 23.1103 Before she left, Oswald told Marina that

she should not tell anyone about his impending trip to Mexico.1104

Marina kept this secret until after the assassination.1105 On the

previous day, Oswald's landlord had seen Mrs. Paine's car being packed

and had asked Oswald whose rent was about 15 days overdue, whether he

was leaving. Oswald told him that Marina was leaving temporarily but

that he would remain.1106 A neighbor testified that on the evening of

September 24, he saw Oswald, carrying two pieces of luggage, hurriedly

leave the Magazine Street apartment and board a bus.1107 Though

uncertain of the exact date, a city busdriver recalls that at the same

time of day and at the same location he picked up a man who was

carrying two suitcases of different sizes and helped him place them so

that they would not disturb the other passengers. The driver remembers

that the man asked directions to the Greyhound bus station. He

discharged the passenger at an intersection where he could board a

Canal Street car and transfer to another bus which would go past the

Greyhound and Continental Trailways stations.1108 The landlord found

Oswald's apartment vacant on September 25.1109

</p><p>Oswald appears to have taken with him a Spanish-English

dictionary; 1110 his address book; 1111 his 1963 passport and old

passport; 1112 his correspondence with the Communist Party and with

the Soviet Embassy in Washington, some of which was in Russian; 1113

proof of his marriage; 1114 newspaper clippings concerning his arrest

and his interest in the activities of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee

1115 (activities which, Marina testified, he had undertaken because he

thought that they would help him when he got to Cuba); 1116 evidence

that he

</p><p><strong>Page 731</strong>

</p><p>was the "Director" of the New Orleans chapter of the Committee; 1117

and various other cards, such as a work card, which he had obtained in

Russia.1118  He took also several sheets of notepaper on which he had

written a summary of important events in his life which he presumably

intended to call to the attention of Cuban and Soviet officials in

Mexico City to convince them to let him enter Cuba. On these sheets he

had recorded facts about his Marine service, including the dates of

his enlistment and discharge, the places where he had served, and the

diplomas that he had received from military school. Recorded also were

notes on his stay in the Soviet Union, his early interest in Communist

literature, his ability to speak Russian, his organization of the New

Orleans chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, his contact with

police authorities in connection with his work for the Committee, and

his experience in "street agitation," as a "radio speaker and

lecturer," and as a photographer.1119 The two pieces of luggage which

Oswald took with him were a small, blue, zipper bag 1120 and a large,

olive-colored bag,1121 both made of cloth. He carried the smaller bag

with him throughout the trip, but, at least from Nuevo Laredo to

Mexico City, checked the larger one through to his destination.1122

</p><p>Oswald remained in New Orleans until September 25. His precise

whereabouts on the night of September 24 are uncertain, but in view of

his limited finances, he probably returned to the apartment to sleep

after checking his luggage at a bus station or spent the night at an

inexpensive hotel or roominghouse. Some time after 5 a. m. on

September 25, he collected a Texas unemployment compensation check for

$33 at his New Orleans post office box. He cashed the check between 8

a.m. and noon at a store about six blocks from his apartment on

Magazine Street.1123 This gave him about $200 for the trip to

Mexico.1124

</p><p>He left New Orleans by bus,1125 probably on Continental Trailways

Bus No. 5121, departing New Orleans at 12:20 p.m. on September 25, and

scheduled to arrive in Houston at 10:50 p.m.; that bus is the only one

on which Oswald could have left New Orleans after noon on September 25

1126 and arrived in Houston before midnight.1127 Sometime in the

evening he called the home of Horace Elroy Twiford, a member of the

Socialist Labor Party who had received Oswald's name from the party's

headquarters in New York and sent him a copy of its official

publication, the "Weekly People." 1128 Mrs. Twiford, who answered the

telephone,1129 believes that the call was made locally, before 10 p.m.

It may have been made from Beaumont or some other stop on the route;

however, in view of the bus schedule, it probably was made in Houston

later than Mrs. Twiford remembered.1130 Oswald told Mrs. Twiford that

he was a member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and that he hoped

to see her husband for a few hours that evening before he flew to

Mexico. He wanted also to find out how Twiford had obtained his name

and address. Mrs. Twiford told Oswald that her husband, a merchant

seaman, was at sea but would be happy to see him at some other time;

she offered to take a message.

</p><p><strong>Page 732</strong>

</p><p>Oswald said that he could not await her husband's return because he

was flying to Mexico.1131 The Twifords have stated that they had no

other contact with Oswald.1132

</p><p>An employee of the U.S. Selective Service System has stated that

an individual calling himself "Harvey Oswald" appeared at her office

in Austin, Tex., immediately after lunch on September 25, and

discussed with her the possibility of rectifying his undesirable

discharge from the Marine Corps.1133 Despite the employee's

reputability and apparent sincerity, all of the information which she

furnished with respect to Oswald's appearance and conversation could

have been derived from news media, consciously or unconsciously, by

the time she told the FBI her story. Other persons in Austin who,

according to the employee's testimony, should also have observed

Oswald failed to corroborate her testimony.1134 No other evidence

tending to show that Oswald was in Austin at this time has been

discovered.

</p><p>The telephone call which Oswald made to the Twifords on the

evening of September 25, indicates that he was either in Houston or on

his way there when he made it, since the purpose of the call was to

make an appointment to see Twiford in Houston that evening. Oswald

could not have left New Orleans on September 25, been in Austin 521

miles away by early afternoon, and returned 162 miles to Houston by

night unless he traveled by air; airline records contain no indication

that Oswald was on such flights.1135 It is very unlikely that he had

with him enough money beyond what he needed for the trip to Mexico

City to take such flights, and the poor state of his finances at this

time plus his well-established frugality make it extremely unlikely

that he would have considered it worthwhile to do so even if he could.

There is no evidence that Oswald was in such a hurry to reach Mexico

that he would have felt it necessary to travel by airplane rather than

a less expensive means of travel. He took a bus from Houston to Mexico

City, lived very inexpensively there, and took a bus back to Dallas;

there is no apparent reason why he would have interrupted such an

inexpensive trip to fly to Austin and then to Houston. He told a

passenger whom he met on the next leg of his trip that he had come

from New Orleans, and made no reference to Austin.1136

</p><p>On September 26, Oswald boarded Continental Trailways bus No. 5133

in Houston and departed at 2:35 a.m. for Laredo, Tex., via Corpus

Christi and Alice.1137 Two British tourists, Dr. and Mrs. John B.

McFarland, who boarded No. 5133 in Houston, noticed Oswald when they

awoke at about 6 a.m. Oswald told them that he was going to Cuba via

Mexico City, and they inferred from conversation with him that he had

left New Orleans early in the afternoon of September 25 and that he

was going to Cuba via Mexico City. He said also that he was secretary

of the New Orleans branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and that

he hoped to see Fidel Castro in Cuba. The bus was scheduled to arrive

in Laredo at approximately 1:20 p.m.1138

</p><p><strong>Page 733</strong>

</p><p>Oswald crossed the border from Laredo to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico,

between 1:30 and 2 p.m.1139 From Nuevo Laredo, he traveled to Mexico

City aboard bus No. 516 of the Flecha Roja Bus Line, which departed at

2:15 p.m. and was scheduled to arrive in Mexico City at 9:45 a.m. on

the following day; he held baggage claim check No. 320435.1140 He was

seen on the bus by the McFarlands and by two Australian girls who

boarded the bus on the evening of September 26 at Monterrey.1141 He

occupied the seat next to an elderly Englishman, who told the girls

that the young man sitting next to him apparently had been to Mexico

before.1142 The man next to Oswald was probably Albert Osborne, a

native of the British Isles who has worked as an itinerant preacher in

the Southern United States and Mexico for many years. Osborne denied

that he sat beside Oswald; but in view of his inconsistent and untrue

responses to Federal investigators concerning matters not directly

related to Oswald, the Commission believes that his denial cannot be

credited. It appeared to the other passengers on the bus that Osborne

and Oswald had not previously met; extensive investigation has

revealed no other contact between them.1143

</p><p>In the course of the 20-hour bus trip, Oswald initiated two

conversations with the Australian girls, during which he mentioned his

visit to Russia and recommended the Hotel Cuba in Mexico City as a

clean and cheap" hotel; he told them, apparently falsely, that he had

stayed there on previous occasions. He said that when he had seen them

board the bus with their heavy suitcases, he had been under the

impression that they were Mexican and had therefore asked the man next

to him how to say "How can I help you?" in Spanish. From this they

inferred that Oswald did not speak Spanish, an impression which is

shared by every witness who met Oswald on his trip and is supported by

notations which he made on documents that he carried.1144 He got off

the bus at every stop and ate large meals, always eating by himself;

the girls thought he ate so much because he could not make himself

understood in Spanish and had to order by pointing at the menu.1145

The bus arrived in Mexico City 15 minutes late, at 10 a.m.1146 Oswald

left the bus station by himself and had no known further contact with

any of the people with whom he had spoken on the bus.1147

</p><p>Oswald registered at the Hotel del Comercio within an hour of his

arrival in Mexico City. He stayed there throughout his visit.1148 The

hotel, located not far from the commercial heart of the city and

within four blocks of the bus station, is one of a group of hotels

located near the intercity bus terminals and has perhaps the best

appearance of the group.1149 It is known by personnel in other hotels

that the owner of the Hotel del Comercio can understand and speak a

little English.1150 Oswald registered as "Lee, Harvey Oswald," and

gave his occupation as "photo." 1151 He had room 18 which cost $1.28

per day.1152

</p><p>After he had registered, Oswald turned promptly to the task of

obtaining permission to enter Cuba. Mexican officials would not permit

a U.S. citizen without a Cuban visa to board a plane for Cuba

</p><p><strong>Page 734</strong>

</p><p>even if he had an American passport, but would permit passage if he

had a visa even though the passport proscribed travel to Cuba.1153

Oswald had a 1963 American passport (stamped invalid for travel to

Cuba)1154 but had neither a regular Cuban visa nor an intransit visa

which would permit a short stay in Cuba on his way to Russia or some

other country. His address book contained the telephone number and

address of a Cuban airline, but there is evidence that he never

visited its office.1155

</p><p>He visited the Cuban Embassy on Friday, September 27 and spoke

with Senora Silvia Tirado de Duran, a Mexican citizen employed there.

Senora Duran later made a signed statement to the Mexican police that

Oswald:</p>

    <blockquote>... applied for a visa to Cuba in transit to Russia and based

his application on his presentation of his passport in which it was

recorded that, he had been living in the latter country for a period

of three years, his work permit from that same country written in the

Russian language and letters in the same language, as well as proof of

his being married to a woman of Russian nationality and being the

apparent Director in the city of New Orleans of the organization

called "Fair Play for Cuba" with the desire that he should be accepted

as a "friend" of the Cuban Revolution ... 1156</blockquote>


<p>
He apparently also stated that he was a member of the Communist Party

and displayed documents which he claimed to be evidence of his

membership.1157 He said that he intended to go to Cuba on September 30

and to remain there for 2 weeks, or longer if possible, and then go on

to Russia.1158 Senora Duran took down the relevant date and filled out

the appropriate application. Oswald left the Embassy but was to return

in the afternoon.1159

</p><p>Then, or possibly even before his initial visit to the Cuban

Embassy Oswald went to the Soviet Embassy where he spoke with either

Pavel Antonovich Yatskov or Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov.1160 They

are both consular officials serving also as agents of the KGB.1161

Oswald later said that he had dealt with "Kostin," 1162 undoubtedly a

reference to Kostikov. He was unable to obtain a Soviet visa then.

Marina said that the officials at the Soviet Embassy "refused to have

anything to do with him." 1163

</p><p>Oswald returned to the Cuban Embassy later that afternoon, this

time bringing with him passport photographs which he may have obtained

in the United States.1164 Senora Duran telephoned the Soviet Embassy

to inquire about the status of Oswald's Russian visa and was told that

there would be a delay of about 4 months.1165 Oswald became "highly

agitated and angry," particularly when he learned that he could not

obtain an intransit visa to Cuba before he acquired a Russian visa.

Senora Duran called the Cuban consul, then Eusibio Azque, to speak to

him. The discussion between Oswald and Azque developed into a heated

argument, which ended when Azque told Oswald that in

</p><p><strong>Page 735</strong>

</p><p>his opinion people like Oswald were harming the Cuban Revolution and

that so far as Azque was concerned, he would not give Oswald a

visa.1166 Senora Duran wrote her name and the phone number of the

Embassy on a piece of paper which she gave to Oswald in case he wished

to contact her again. He copied this information into his address

book.1167 Senora Duran forwarded the Cuban visa application to Havana

;1168 the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied on October 15 that

the visa could be issued only after Oswald had obtained a Russian

visa.1169 (See Commission Exhibit, No. 2564, p. 303.)

</p><p>Oswald contacted the Russian and Cuba Embassies again during his

stay in Mexico.1170 He had no greater success than he had before.

Marina testified that when he returned to Texas, he was convinced that

his trip had been a failure and disappointed at having been unable to

go to Cuba.1171 A month later, in a painstakingly composed 1172 letter

to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, Oswald ascribed his failure to "a

gross breach of regulations" on the part of the Cuban Embassy. "Of

corse," he wrote, "the Soviet Embassy was not at fault, they were, as

I say unprepared."

</p><p>The hotel maid said that Oswald generally was gone by the time she

arrived at 9 a.m. The night watchman said he usually returned at about

midnight,1174 which is not unusual, in view of the late hour at which

Mexico City's evening activities begin. He ate several lunches at a

small restaurant immediately adjacent to the hotel, coming to the

restaurant shortly after 2 p.m., and ordering food by pointing to the

menu, apparently with some consideration of cost; he spent between 40

and 48 cents for each meal. He ate the soup of the day, rice, and

either meat or eggs, but refused dessert and coffee; the waitress

concluded that Oswald did not realize that the items which he refused

were included in the price of the lunch.1175 He was seen with no other

person either at his hotel or at the restaurant.1176 A hotel guest

stated that on one occasion he sat down at a table with Oswald because

there was no empty table in the restaurant, but that neither spoke to

the other because of the language barrier.1177

</p><p>Although the Soviet and Cuban Embassies are within two blocks of

each other, they are some distance from Oswald's hotel.1178 He must,

therefore, have traversed a substantial portion of the city on more

than one occasion. Marina testified that he told her that he had seen

a bullfight,1179 which would normally have been on Sunday afternoon,

and that he had visited museums 1180 and done some sightseeing.1181 He

apparently also saw one or more motion pictures, either American with

Spanish subtitles or Mexican with English subtitles.1182 From

notations in his Spanish-English dictionary and on his guide map of

Mexico City, it appears that Oswald intended to attend a jai alai game

1183 but he almost certainly did not do so.1184

</p><p>He purchased several postcards depicting bullfights and tourist

attractions, which he brought back to Marina.1185 She had told him be-

</p><p><strong>Page 736</strong>

</p><p>fore he left that she would like Mexican silver bracelets as a

souvenir, and he brought her a silver bracelet inscribed with her

name.1186 Marina suspected, almost certainly correctly, that the

bracelet, of Japanese origin, did not come from Mexico.1187 No such

jewelry is known to be sold in or around Mexico City, because of a

high duty 1188 but the bracelet is of a type commonly sold in

5-and-10-cent stores in Dallas.1189 Oswald did not buy the Mexican

phonograph records which Marina had requested, despite the notation,

"records," which he had placed in his dictionary.1190

</p><p>On Monday, September 30, Oswald began to prepare for his return to

the United States. He appeared at the Agencia de Viages, Transportes

Chihuahuenses,1191 and purchased international exchange orders costing

$20.30 for travel on a Transportes del Norte bus from Mexico City to

Laredo and by Greyhound bus directly from Laredo to Dallas. The travel

agency made a reservation for him on Transportes del Notre bus No.

332, departing Mexico City at 8:30 a.m. on October 2. The seat, No.

12, was reserved in the name of the travel agency, which recorded the

reservation in the name of "H. O. Lee." 1192 The employee who made the

reservation testified that he probably wrote the name that way because

he was copying from Oswald's tourist card, which read "Lee, Harvey

Oswald." 1193 (The manifest for Transportes Frontera bus No. 340,

leaving Mexico City for Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo at 1 p.m. on

Wednesday, October 2, 1963, contains the name "Oswld" [sic], which

apparently was added to the manifest after the trip; 1194 in any

event, Oswald did not take bus 340.) 1195

</p><p>On October 1, Oswald paid his hotel bill through that night.1196

The hotel night watchman remembers helping Oswald obtain a taxicab at

about 6:30 or 7 on the following morning.1197 Transportes del Norte

bus No. 332 left as scheduled at about 8:30 a.m.; at Monterrey the

passengers were shifted to a relief bus, No. 373, scheduled to depart

for Laredo at 10 p.m. that evening.1193 Fellow passengers recall that

Oswald was pulled off the bus by Mexican officials at the border,

because of some alleged irregularity in his Mexican tourist papers;

one passenger overheard him mumbling complaints about the Mexican

immigration officials when he returned to the bus.1199 They remember

also that Oswald was hurriedly "gulping" down a banana after the bus

reached customs, perhaps because he believed that he could not take

fruit into the United States.1200 (Marina has testified that her

husband liked bananas and frequently ate them.)1201 One of the

passengers testified that Oswald annoyed him by keeping his overhead

light on to read after 10 p.m.1202 He may have conversed with an

elderly woman on the bus, but he was not traveling with her.1203

</p><p>At about 1:35 a.m. on October 3, Oswald crossed the International

Bridge from Nuevo Laredo into Texas.1204 He traveled from Laredo to

Dallas via San Antonio, on Greyhound bus No. 1265, substantially

following Interstate Route 35 for the entire trip 1205 leaving Laredo

at 3 a.m. and arriving in Dallas at about 2:20 p.m. on the same

day.1206</p>

 <strong>DALLAS</strong>

 <p>Oswald did not contact his wife immediately when he returned to

Dallas. He went to the office of the employment commission, where he

filed an unemployment compensation claim 1207 and announced that he

was again looking for work.1208 He spent the night at the YMCA, where

he registered as a serviceman in order to avoid paying the membership

fee.1209 On the following day, he applied for a job as a typesetter

trainee at the Padgett Printing Co. He made a favorable impression on

the department foreman, but the plant superintendent called

Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall and decided not to hire Oswald because of the

unfavorable responses which his inquiries produced.1210 Later that

day, Oswald telephoned Marina and asked her to have Mrs. Paine pick

him up in Dallas. Marina refused, and he hitchhiked out to the Paine

home,1211 where he spent part or all of the weekend.1210 Marina

testified that although her husband "changed for the better" and

treated her better after his Mexican trip,1213 she did not want to

live with him because she was pregnant and thought it would be better

"to be with a woman who spoke English and Russian." 1214 On Monday,

October 7, Mrs. Paine drove Oswald to the bus station, and he returned

to Dallas to look for a job and a place to live.1215

</p><p>Oswald thought that the YMCA was too expensive for him, and

intended to rent a room.1216 He inquired about a room at 1026 North

Beckley, where he lived later, but on October 7 there were no

vacancies.1217 He next responded to a "For Rent" sign at a rooming

house at 621 Marsalis Street. He obtained a room, for which he paid

the weekly rent of $7 in advance, and moved in on the same day.1218 He

immediately resumed his job-hunting, relying partially on referrals

by the employment commission.1219 He spent much of the time when he

was not looking for work in his room.1220 He telephoned his wife

daily.1221 She wrote: "Lee called twice a day, was worried about my

health and about June." 1222 On Friday, Oswald told his landlady, Mrs.

Mary Bledsoe, that he was going to Irving for the weekend but would

return the following week. She refused to rent the room to him for

another week because she didn't like him.1223

</p><p>Oswald spent the weekend of October 12-13 at Mrs. Paine's home,

during which time she gave him a driving lesson.1224 He told her that

he had received the last of the unemployment checks due him, and that

it had been smaller than the previous ones. Mrs. Paine testified that

Oswald was extremely discouraged because his wife was expecting a

baby, he had no job prospects in sight, and he no longer had any

source of income.1225

</p><p>On Monday, Mrs. Paine drove Oswald into Dallas, since she had

other business there.1226 He picked up his bag from Mrs. Bledsoe's

roominghouse 1227 and later that day rented a room at 1026 North

Beckley Avenue from Mrs. A. C. Johnson for $8 a week. He registered as

O. H. Lee and moved in immediately.1228 Oswald felt that this room was

more comfortable than the previous one, particularly

</p><p><strong>Page 738</strong>

</p><p>because he had television and refrigerator privileges.1229 He

apparently continued to spend most of his evenings in his room.1230

He borrowed books from the library 1231 and had subscriptions to

various periodicals, including Time, the Worker, the Militant, and

some Russian periodicals.1232

</p><p>On that Monday, Mrs. Paine mentioned the Oswalds' financial and

employment problems to neighbors whom she was visiting. Mrs. Linnie

Mac Randle, who was also present, remarked that she thought that her

younger brother, Buell Wesley Frazier, who worked at the Texas School

Book Depository, had said that there was a job opening there. When

Marina heard of this, she asked Mrs. Paine to call the Depository to

see if there was an opening.1233 Mrs. Paine called Roy S. Truly,

superintendent of the Depository, who indicated that he would talk to

Oswald if he would apply in person.1234 When Oswald telephoned the

Paine house on Monday evening, Mrs. Paine told him about this

possibility.1235 On the next day, Oswald was interviewed by Truly and

hired in a temporary capacity. He began work on Wednesday, October 16.

His duties were to fill book orders; his hours were 8 a.m. to 4:45

p.m., for which he received $1.25 an hour.1236

</p><p>Both the Oswalds were elated with the new job,1237 although it

apparently required little skill or experience 1238 and he indicated

that he still hoped to obtain a better job.1239  He did a satisfactory

job at the Depository,1240 but he kept to himself and very few of his

fellow employees got to know him.1241

</p><p>

During his first week at work, Oswald became acquainted with Frazier, with whom 

he arranged to ride to Irving on weekends.1242 On Friday, October 18, Frazier 

drove him from work to the Paine home; 1243 since it was his birthday, Marina 

and Ruth Paine had arranged a small celebration.1244 On Sunday, he stayed with 

June and the Paine children, while Mrs. Paine drove Marina to Parkland Hospital 

where she gave birth to a second daughter, Rachel.1245 He went to work on Monday, 

but that evening visited Marina in the hospital and spent the night in Irving.1246 

Marina wrote: </p>

<p>Monday evening Lee visited me in the hospital. He was very happy at the birth 

  of another daughter and even wept a little. He said that two daughters were 

  better for each other--two sisters. He stayed with me about two hours.1247<br>

  Oswald returned to Dallas the next morning.1248 </p>

<p>Oswald wrote to Arnold Johnson of the Communist Party, U.S.A., that on the 

  evening of October 23, he had attended an "ultra right" meeting headed 

  by Gen. Edwin A. Walker.1249 Two evenings later, he accompanied Michael Paine 

  to a meeting of the American Civil Liberties Union, held at Southern Methodist 

  University.1250 At this meeting, a statement was made to the effect that members 

  of the John Birch Society should not be considered anti-Semitic; Oswald rose 

  and stated that at the meeting which he had attended 2 days earlier, he had 

  heard a number of anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic statements. </p>

<p><strong>Page 739</strong> </p>

<p>Later in the evening, Oswald became involved in a discussion with several people, 

  including Frank Krystinik, who was employed with Paine at the Bell Helicopter 

  plant. During this conversation, Oswald expressed Marxist views and declared 

  that he was a Marxist, although denying that he was a Communist. He admitted 

  that the United States was superior to the Soviet Union in the area of civil 

  liberties and praised President Kennedy for his work in that connection.1251 

  Krystinik testified that he got the impression that Oswald did not fully understand 

  the views he was expounding.1252 </p>

<p>Throughout that week Oswald telephoned his wife to inquire about her health 

  and that of the baby. He spent the weekend at the Paine home, to which Marina 

  and Rachel had returned during the week.1253 On Friday, November 1, he obtained 

  post office box No. 6225 at the Terminal Annex Post Office Station. He indicated 

  that the box would also be used to receive mail for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee 

  and the American Civil Liberties Union.1254 Once again he spent the weekend 

  in Irving.1255 </p>

<p>Throughout this period, the FBI had been aware of the whereabouts of the Oswalds. 

  There was a record in the Dallas office of the FBI that Oswald subscribed to 

  the Worker, engaged in Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities and had traveled 

  to Mexico.1256 An FBI agent visited the Paine home on November and, accompanied 

  by another agent, again on November 5, and spoke briefly with Mrs. Paine. On 

  neither occasion was Oswald present.1257 Ruth Paine noted the agent's name and 

  telephone number and, in accordance with her husband's instructions, Marina 

  noted the license number of the agent's automobile, all of which was subsequently 

  reported to Oswald.1258 Both Mrs. Paine and Marina testified that Oswald was 

  troubled by the FBI's interest in him.1259 He declared that the FBI was "trying 

  to inhibit" his activities,1260 and wrote the Soviet Embassy in Washington: 

</p>

<p>The Federal Bureu of Investigation is not now interested in my activities in 

  the progressive organization "Fair Play for Cuba Committee" of which 

  I was secretary in New Orleans (state Louisiana) since I no longer reside in 

  that state. However, the F.B.I. has visted us here in Dallas, Texas, on November 

  1st. Agent James P. Hasty warned me that if I engaged in F.P.C.C. activities 

  in Texas the F.B.I. will again take an "interest" in me. <br>

  This agent also 'suggested' to Marina Nichilayeva that she could remain in the 

  United States under F.B.I. 'protection', that is, she could defect from the 

  Soviet Union, of couse, I and my wife strongly protested these tactics by the 

  notorious F.B.I. </p>

<p>Please inform us of the arrival of our Soviet entrance visa's as soon as they 

  come.1261 (See Commission Exhibit 15, p. 311.)</p>

<p>Marina testified that the statements, both by and to the FBI agents, to which 

  her husband referred in this letter, were in fact never made.1262 </p>

<p><strong>Page 740</strong> </p>

<p>The following Friday, November 8, Oswald as usual drove to the Paine house 

  with Frazier.1263 On Saturday Mrs. Paine took him to the Texas Drivers' License 

  Examining Station, but because it was an election day the station was closed. 

  Oswald stayed at the Paines through Monday, November 11, which was Veterans 

  Day. During the weekend, Mrs. Paine gave Oswald a second driving lesson. </p>

<p>Oswald did not go to Irving on the next weekend. His wife had asked him not 

  to come because Michael Paine, with whom Oswald did not get along, would be 

  there to celebrate his daughter's birthday. Also, she felt that because he had 

  stayed for 3 days the preceding weekend, he would abuse Mrs. Paine's hospitality 

  if he returned so soon. Oswald telephoned Marina on Saturday afternoon and said 

  that he had returned to the drivers' license examining station that morning 

  but had not waited because there was a long line.1265 </p>

<p>On Sunday, November 17, at Marina's request, Ruth Paine telephoned Oswald at 

  the Beckley Avenue number, which he had given to Marina. When she asked for 

  him, she was told that no one by that name lived at the address, which greatly 

  surprised her. On the next day, Oswald telephoned his wife. When she indicated 

  that she had been upset by the fact that there had been no Lee Oswald at the 

  number which she had asked Mrs. Paine to call Oswald became angry; he said that 

  he was using a fictitious name and that she should not have called the Beckley 

  Avenue number.1266 He did not telephone on the following day, which was unusual.1267 

</p>

<p>On the morning of Thursday, November 21, Oswald asked Frazier to take him to 

  Irving when he went home that evening, saying that he wanted to pick up some 

  curtain rods.1268 His arrival was a surprise because he generally asked Mrs. 

  Paine's permission before arriving for a visit.1269 The women thought that he 

  had come to Irving because he felt badly about arguing with his wife about the 

  use of the fictitious name.1270 He said that he was lonely, because he had not 

  come the preceding weekend, and told Marina that he "wanted to make his 

  peace" with her.1271 He spent the time before dinner on the lawn playing 

  with his daughter.1272 However, when he attempted to talk to his wife she would 

  not answer, which upset him. He asked her to live with him in Dallas, and she 

  refused.1273 After supper, Oswald watched television while the women cleaned 

  the house and prepared their children for bed.1274 He retired early in the evening 

  at about 9.1275 </p>
