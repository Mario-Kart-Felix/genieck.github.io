THE EVIDENCE 

reviewed above identifies Lee Harvey Oswald as the

assassin of President Kennedy and indicates that he acted alone in

that event. There is no evidence that he had accomplices or that he

was involved in any conspiracy directed to the assassination of the

President. There remains the question of what impelled Oswald to

conceive and to carry out the assassination of the President of the

United States. The Commission has considered many possible motives for

the assassination, including those which might flow from Oswald's

commitment to Marxism or communism, the existence of some personal

grievance, a desire to effect changes in the structure of society or

simply to go down in history as a well publicized assassin. None of

these possibilities satisfactorily explains Oswald's act if it is

judged by the standards of reasonable men. The motives of any man,

however, must be analyzed in terms of the character and state of mind

of the particular individual involved. For a motive that appears

incomprehensible to other men may be the moving force of a man whose

view of the world has been twisted, possibly by factors of which those

around him were only dimly aware. Oswald's complete state of mind and

character are now outside of the power of man to know. He cannot, of

course, be questioned or observed by those charged with the

responsibility for this report or by experts on their behalf. There

is, however, a large amount of material available in his writings and

in the history of his life which does give some insight into his

character and, possibly, into the motives for his act.
</p>
<p>Since Oswald is dead, the Commission is not able to reach any

definite conclusions as to whether or not he was "sane" under

prevailing legal standards. Under our system of justice no forum could

properly make that determination unless Oswald were before it. It

certainly could not be made by this Commission which, as has been

pointed out above, ascertained the facts surrounding the assassination

but did not draw conclusions concerning Oswald's legal guilt.

</p>
<p>Indications of Oswald's motivation may be obtained from a study of

the events, relationships and influences which appear to have been

</p> <p><strong>Page 376</strong></p>

<p>significant in shaping his character and in guiding him. Perhaps the

most outstanding conclusion of such a study is that Oswald was

profoundly alienated from the world in which he lived. His life was

characterized by isolation, frustration, and failure. He had very few,

if any, close relationships with other people and he appeared to have

great difficulty in finding a meaningful place in the world. He was

never satisfied with anything. When he was in the United States he

resented the capitalist system which he thought was exploiting him and

others like him. He seemed to prefer the Soviet Union and he spoke

highly of Cuba.1 When he was in the Soviet Union, he apparently

resented the Communist Party members, who were accorded special

privileges and who he thought were betraying communism, and he spoke

well of the United States.2 He accused his wife of preferring others

to himself and told her to return to the Soviet Union without him but

without a divorce. At the same time he professed his love for her and

said that he could not get along without her.3 Marina Oswald thought

that he would not be happy anywhere, "Only on the moon, perhaps." 4

</p>
<p>
While Oswald appeared to most of those who knew him as a meek and

harmless person, he sometimes imagined himself as "the Commander" 5

and, apparently seriously, as a political prophet--a man who said that

after 20 years he would be prime minister.6 His wife testified that he

compared himself with great readers of history. Such ideas of grandeur

were apparently accompanied by notions of oppression.7 He had a great

hostility toward his environment, whatever it happened to be, which he

expressed in striking and sometimes violent acts long before the

assassination. There was some quality about him that led him to act

with an apparent disregard for possible consequences.8 He defected to

the Soviet Union, shot at General Walker, tried to go to Cuba and even

contemplated hijacking an airplane to get there. He assassinated the

President, shot Officer Tippit, resisted arrest and tried to kill

another policeman in the process.
</p>
  <p>Oswald apparently started reading about communism when he was

about 15. In the Marines, he evidenced a strong conviction as to the

correctness of Marxist doctrine, which one associate described as

"irrevocable," but also as "theoretical"; that associate did not think

that Oswald was a Communist.9 Oswald did not always distinguish

between Marxism and communism. 10 He stated several times that he was

a Communist but apparently never joined any Communist Party.11

</p> <p>His attachment to Marxist and Communist doctrine was probably, in

some measure, an expression of his hostility to his environment. While

there is doubt about how fully Oswald understood the doctrine which he

so often espoused, it seems clear that his commitment to Marxism was

an important factor influencing his conduct during his adult years. It

was an obvious element in his decision to go to Russia and later to

Cuba and it probably influenced his decision to shoot at General

Walker. It was a factor which contributed to his character

</p> <p><strong>Page 377</strong>

</p> <p>and thereby might have influenced his decision to assassinate

President Kennedy.

</p> <p>The discussion below will describe the events known to the

Commission which most clearly reveals the formation and nature of

Oswald's character. It will attempt to summarize the events of his

early life, his experience in New York City and in the Marine Corps,

and his interest in Marxism. It will examine his defection to the

Soviet Union in 1959, his subsequent return to the United States and

his life here after June of 1962. The review of the latter period will

evaluate his personal and employment relations, his attempt to kill

General Walker, his political activities, and his unsuccessful attempt

to go to Cuba in late September of 1963. Various possible motives will

be treated in the appropriate context of the discussion outlined

above.</p>
 
<p><b><a name="early" id="early"></a>The Early Years</b></p>
    <p>Significant in shaping the character of Lee Harvey Oswald was the
death of his father, a collector of insurance premiums. This occurred
2 months before Lee was born in New Orleans on October 18, 1939.12
That death strained the financial fortunes of the remainder of the
Oswald family. It had its effect on Lee's mother, Marguerite, his
brother Robert, who had been born in 1934, and his half-brother John
Pic, who had been born in 1932 during Marguerite's previous
marriage.13 It forced Marguerite Oswald to go to work to provide for
her family.14 Reminding her sons that they were orphans and that the
family's financial condition was poor, she placed John Pic and Robert
Oswald in an orphans' home.15 From the time Marguerite Oswald returned
to work until December 26, 1942, when Lee too was sent to the orphans'
home, he was cared for principally by his mother's sister, by
babysitters and by his mother, when she had time for him.16
	</p> <p>Marguerite Oswald withdrew Lee from the orphans' home and took him
with her to Dallas when he was a little over 4 years old.17 About 6
months later she also withdrew John Pic and Robert Oswald.18
Apparently that action was taken in anticipation of her marriage to
Edwin A. Ekdahl, which took place in May of 1945.19 In the fall of
that year John Pic and Robert Oswald went to a military academy where
they stayed, except for vacations, until the spring of 1948.20 Lee
Oswald remained with his mother and Ekdahl,21 to whom he became quite
attached. John Pic testified that he thought Lee found in Ekdahl the
father that he never had.22 That situation, however, was short-lived,
for the relations between Marguerite Oswald and Ekdahl were stormy and
they were finally divorced, after several separations and reunions, in
the summer of 1948.23
	</p> <p>After the divorce Mrs. Oswald complained considerably about how
unfairly she was treated, dwelling on the fact that she was a widow
with three children. John Pic, however, did not think her position was
worse than that of many other people.24 In the fall of 1948 she told
John Pic and Robert Oswald that she could not afford to send them back
to the military school and she asked Pic to quit school
</p> <p><b>Page 378</b>
</p> <p>entirely to help support the family, which he did for 4 months in the
fall of 1948.25 In order to supplement their income further she
falsely swore that Pic was 17 years old so that he could join the
Marine Corps Reserves.26 Pic did turn over part of his income to his
mother, but he returned to high school in January of 1949, where he
stayed until 3 days before he was scheduled to graduate, when he left
school in order to get into the Coast Guard.27 Since his mother did
not approve of his decision to continue school he accepted the
responsibility for that decision himself and signed his mother's name
to all his own excuses and report cards.28
	</p> <p>Pic thought that his mother overstated her financial problems and
was unduly concerned about money. Referring to the period after the
divorce from Ekdahl, which was apparently caused in part by
Marguerite's desire to get more money from him, Pic said: "Lee was
brought up in this atmosphere of constant money problems, and I am
sure it had quite an effect on him, and also Robert." 29 Marguerite
Oswald worked in miscellaneous jobs after her divorce from Ekdahl.30
When she worked for a time as an insurance saleslady, she would
sometimes take Lee with her, apparently leaving him alone in the car
while she transacted her business.31 When she worked during the school
year, Lee had to leave an empty house in the morning, return to it for
lunch and then again at night, his mother having trained him to do
that rather than to play with other children.32
	</p> <p>An indication of the nature of Lee's character at this time was
provided in the spring of 1950, when he was sent to New Orleans to
visit the family of his mother's sister, Mrs. Lillian Murret, for 2 or
3 weeks. Despite their urgings, he refused to play with the other
children his own age.33 It also appears that Lee tried to tag along
with his older brothers but apparently was not able to spend as much
time with them as he would have liked, because of the age gaps of 5
and 7 years, which became more significant as the children grew
older.34
</p> <p><a href="chapter-7.html#top" name="newyork">Return to Top</a></p> <p>
<b>New York City</b>
</p> <p>Whatever problems may have been created by Lee's home life in
Louisiana and Texas, he apparently adjusted well enough there to have
had an average, although gradually deteriorating, school record with
no behavior or truancy problems. That was not the case, however, after
he and his mother moved to New York in August of 1952, shortly before
Lee's 13th birthday. They moved shortly after Robert joined the
Marines; they lived for a time with John Pic who was stationed there
with the Coast Guard.35 Relations soon became strained, however,36 so
in late September Lee and his mother moved to their own apartment in
the Bronx.37 Pic and his wife would have been happy to have kept Lee,
however, who was becoming quite a disciplinary problem for his mother,
having struck her on at least one occasion.38
</p> <p>The short-lived stay with the Pics was terminated after an
incident in which Lee allegedly pulled out a pocket knife during an
argument
</p> <p><b>Page 379</b>
</p> <p>and threatened to use it on Mrs. Pic. When Pic returned home, Mrs.
Oswald tried to play down the event but Mrs. Pic took a different view
and asked the Oswalds to leave. Lee refused to discuss the matter with
Pic, whom he had previously idolized, and their relations were
strained thereafter. 39
</p> <p>On September 30, 1952, Lee enrolled in P.S. 117,40  a junior high
school in the Bronx, where the other children apparently teased him
because of his "western" clothes and Texas accent.41 He began to stay
away from school, preferring to read magazines and watch television at
home by himself. 42 This continued despite the efforts of the school
authorities and, to a lesser extent, of his mother to have him return
to school. 43 Truancy charges were brought against him alleging that
he was "beyond the control of his mother insofar as school attendance
is concerned." 44 Oswald was remanded for psychiatric observation
to Youth House, an institution in which children are kept for
psychiatric observation or for detention pending court appearance or
commitment to a child-caring or custodial institution such as a training
school. 45 He was in Youth House from April 16 to May 7, 1953,46
during which time he was examined by its Chief Psychiatrist, Dr.
Renatus Hartogs, and interviewed and observed by other members of the
Youth House staff. 47
</p> <p>Marguerite Oswald visited her son at Youth House, where she
recalled that she waited in line "with Puerto Ricans and Negroes and
everything." 48 She said that her pocketbook was searched "because the
children in this home were such criminals, dope fiends, and had been
in criminal offenses, that anybody entering this home had to be
searched in case the parents were bringing cigarettes or narcotics or
anything." 49 She recalled that Lee cried and said, "Mother, I want to
get out of here. There are children in here who have killed people,
and smoke. I want to get out." 50 Marguerite Oswald said that she had
not realized until then in what kind of place her son had been
confined. 51
</p> <p>On the other hand, Lee told his probation officer, John Carro,
that "while he liked Youth House he miss[ed] the freedom of doing what
he wanted. He indicated that he did not miss his mother." 52 Mrs.
Evelyn D Siegel, a social worker who interviewed both Lee and his
mother while Lee was confined in Youth House, reported that Lee
"confided that the worse thing about Youth House was the fact that he
had to be with other boys all the time, was disturbed about disrobing
in front of them, taking showers with them etc." 53
</p> <p>Contrary to reports that appeared after the assassination, the
psychiatric examination did not indicate that Lee Oswald was a
potential assassin, potentially dangerous, that "his outlook on life
had strongly paranoid overtones" or that he should be
institutionalized.54 Dr. Hartogs did find Oswald to be a tense,
withdrawn, and evasive boy who intensely disliked talking about
himself and his feelings. He noted that Lee liked to give the
impression that he did not care for other people but preferred to keep
to himself, so that he was not bothered and did not have to make the
effort of communicating. Os-
</p> <p><b>Page 380</b>
</p> <p>wald's withdrawn tendencies and solitary habits were thought to be the
result of "intense anxiety, shyness, feelings of awkwardness and
insecurity." 55 He was reported to have said "I don't want a friend
and I don't like to talk to people" and "I dislike everybody." 56 He
was also described as having a "Vivid fantasy life, turning around the
topics of omnipotence and power, through which he tries to compensate
for his present shortcomings and frustrations." 57 Dr. Hartogs
summarized his report by stating:</p>
    <blockquote>This 13 year old well built boy has superior mental resources and
functions only slightly below his capacity level in spite of chronic
truancy from school which brought him into Youth House. No finding of
neurological impairment or psychotic mental changes could be made. Lee
has to be diagnosed as "personality pattern disturbance with schizoid
features and passive--aggressive tendencies." Lee has to be seen as an
emotionally, quite disturbed youngster who suffers under the impact of
really existing emotional isolation and deprivation, lack of
affection, absence of family life and rejection by a self involved and
conflicted mother.58</blockquote>
<p>
Dr. Hartogs recommended that Oswald be placed on probation on
condition that he seek help and guidance through a child guidance
clinic. There, he suggested, Lee should be treated by a male
psychiatrist who could substitute for the lack of a father figure. He
also recommended that Mrs. Oswald seek "psychotherapeutic guidance
through contact with a family agency." The possibility of commitment
was to be considered only if the probation plan was not successful. 59
</p> <p>Lee's withdrawal was also noted by Mrs. Siegel, who described him
as a "seriously detached, withdrawn youngster." 60 She also noted that
there was "a rather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally
starved, affectionless youngster which grows as one speaks to him." 61
She thought that he had detached himself from the world around him
because "no one in it ever met any of his needs for love." 62 She
observed that since Lee's mother worked all day, he made his own meals
and spent all his time alone because he didn't make friends with the
boys in the neighborhood. She thought that he "withdrew into a
completely solitary and detached existence where he did as he wanted
and he didn't have to live by any rules or come into contact with
people." 63 Mrs. Siegel concluded that Lee "just felt that his mother
never gave a damn for him. He always felt like a burden that she
simply just had to tolerate." 64 Lee confirmed some of those
observations by saying that he felt almost as if there were a veil
between him and other people through which they could not reach him,
but that he preferred the veil to remain intact. He admitted to
fantasies about being powerful and sometimes hurting and killing
people, but refused to elaborate on them. He took the position that
such matters were his own business. 65
</p> <p><b>Page 381</b>
</p> <p>A psychological human figure-drawing test corroborated the
interviewer's findings that Lee was insecure and had limited social
contacts. Irving Sokolow, a Youth House psychologist reported that:</p>
    <blockquote>The Human Figure Drawings are empty, poor characterizations of
persons approximately the same age as the subject. They reflect a
considerable amount of impoverishment in the social and emotional
areas. He appears to be a somewhat insecure youngster exhibiting much
inclination for warm and satisfying relationships to others. There is
some indication that he may relate to men more easily than to women in
view of the more mature conceptualisation. He appears slightly
withdrawn and in view of the lack of detail within the drawings this
may assume a more significant characteristic. He exhibits some
difficulty in relationship to the maternal figure suggesting more
anxiety in this area than in any other.66</blockquote>
<p>
Lee scored an IQ of 118 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children. According to Sokolow, this indicated a "present intellectual
functioning in the upper range of bright normal intelligence." 67
Sokolow said that although Lee was "presumably disinterested in school
subjects he operates on a much higher than average level." 68 On the
Monroe Silent Reading Test, Lee's score indicated no retardation in
reading speed and comprehension; he had better than average ability in
arithmetical reasoning for his age group. 69 </p>
<p>Lee told Carro, his probation officer, that he liked to be by
himself because he had too much difficulty in making friends. 70 The
reports of Carro and Mrs. Siegel also indicate an ambivalent attitude
toward authority on Oswald's part. Carro reported that Lee was
disruptive in class after he returned to school on a regular basis in
the fall of 1953. He had refused to salute the flag and was doing very
little, if any, work. It appears that he did not want to do any of the
things which the authorities suggested in their efforts to bring him
out of the shell into which he appeared to be retreating.71 He told
Mrs. Siegel that he would run away if sent to a boarding school. On
the other hand he also told her that he wished his mother had been
more firm with him in her attempts to get him to return to school. 72
</p> <p>The reports of the New York authorities indicate that Lee's mother
gave him very little affection and did not serve as any sort of
substitute for a father. Furthermore she did not appear to understand
her own relationship to Lee's psychological problems. After her
interview with Mrs. Oswald, Mrs. Siegel described her as a smartly
dressed, gray haired woman, very self-possessed and alert and
superficially affable," but essentially a "defensive, rigid,
self-involved person who had real difficulty in accepting and relating
to people" and who had "little understanding" of Lee's behavior and of
the "protective shell he has drawn around himself." 73 Dr. Hartogs
reported that Mrs. Oswald did not understand that Lee's withdrawal was
a form of "violent but silent protest against his neglect by her and
represents his reac-</p>
  <p><b>Page 382</b></p>

<p>tion to a complete absence of any real family life." 74 Carro reported
that when questioned about his mother Lee said, "well I've got to live
with her. I guess I love her." 75 It may also be significant that, as
reported by John Pic, "Lee slept with my mother until I joined the
service in 1950. This would make him approximately 10, well, almost 11
years old." 76</p>
<p>The factors in Lee Oswald's personality which were noted by those
who had contact with him in New York indicate that he had great
difficulty in adapting himself to conditions in that city. His usual
reaction to the problems which he encountered there was simply
withdrawal. Those factors indicated a severe inability to enter into
relationships with other people. In view of his experiences when he
visited his relatives in New Orleans in the spring of 1950, and his
other solitary habits, Lee had apparently been experiencing similar
problems before going to New York, and as will be shown below, this
failure to adapt to. his environment was a dominant trait in his later
life.</p>
<p>It would be incorrect, however, to believe that those aspects of
Lee's personality which were observed in New York could have led
anyone to predict the outburst of violence which finally occurred.
Carro was the only one of Oswald's three principal observers who
recommended that he be placed in a boy's home or similar institution.
77 But Carro was quite specific that his recommendation was based
primarily on the adverse factors in Lee's environment--his lack of
friends, the apparent unavailability of any agency assistance and the
ineffectualness of his mother--and not on any particular mental
disturbance, in the boy himself.78 Carro testified that:</p>

    <blockquote>There was nothing that would lead me to believe when I saw him at
the age of 12 that them would be seeds of destruction for somebody. I
couldn't in all honesty sincerely say such a thing. 79</blockquote>

Mrs. Siegel concluded her report with the statement that:
    <blockquote>Despite his withdrawal, he gives the impression that he is not so
difficult to reach as he appears and patient, prolonged effort in a
sustained relationship with one therapist might bring results. There
are indications that he has suffered serious personality damage but if
he can receive help quickly this might be repaired to some extent.80</blockquote>
<p>
Lee Oswald never received that help. Few social agencies even in
New York were equipped to provide the kind of intensive treatment that
he needed, and when one of the city's clinics did find room to handle
him, for some reason the record does not show, advantage was never
taken of the chance afforded to Oswald. When Lee became a disciplinary
problem upon his return to school in the fall of 1953, and when his
mother failed to cooperate in any way with school authorities,
authorities were finally forced to consider placement in a home for
boys. Such a placement was postponed, however, perhaps in part at
</p> <p><b>Page 383</b>
</p> <p>least because Lee's behavior suddenly improved. Before the court took
any action, the Oswalds left New York 81 in January of 1954, and
returned to New Orleans where Lee finished the ninth grade before he
left school to work for a year. 82 Then in October of 1956, he joined
the Marines. 83
</p> <p><a href="chapter-7.html#top" name="return">Return to Top</a></p> <p>
<b>Return to New Orleans and Joining the Marine Corps</b>
</p> <p>After his return to New Orleans Oswald was teased at school
because of the northern accent which he had acquired.84 He concluded
that school had nothing to offer him. 85 His mother exercised little
control over him and thought he could decide for himself whether to go
on in school.86 Neighbors and others who knew him at that time recall
an introverted boy who read a great deal.87 He took walks and visited
museums, and sometimes rode a rented bicycle in the park on Saturday
mornings.88 Mrs. Murret believes that he talked at length with a girl
on the telephone, but no one remembers that he had any dates. 89 A
friend, Edward Voebel, testified that "he was more bashful about girls
than anything else." 90
</p> <p>Several witnesses testified that Lee Oswald was not aggressive. 91
He was, however, involved in some fights. Once a group of white boys
beat him up for sitting in the Negro section of a bus, which he
apparently did simply out of ignorance. 92 Another time, he fought
with two brothers who claimed that he had picked on the younger of
them, 3 years Oswald's junior. Two days later, "some big guy, probably
from a high school--he looked like a tremendous football player"
accosted Oswald on the way home from school and punched him in the
mouth, making his lip bleed and loosening a tooth. Voebel took Oswald
back to the school to attend to his wounds, and their "mild
friendship" stemmed from that incident.93 Voebel also recalled that
Oswald once outlined a plan to cut the glass in the window of a store
on Rampart Street and steal a pistol, but he was not sure then that
Oswald meant to carry out the plan, and in fact they never did. Voebel
said that Oswald "wouldn't start any fights, but if you wanted to
start one with him, he was going to make sure that he ended it, or you
were going to really have one, because he wasn't going to take
anything from anybody." 94 In a space for the names of "close friends"
on the ninth grade personal history record, Oswald first wrote "Edward
Vogel," an obvious misspelling of Voebel's name, and "Arthor Abear,"
most likely Arthur Hebert, a classmate who has said that he did not
know Oswald well. Oswald erased those names, however, and indicated
that he had no close friends.95
</p> <p>It has been suggested that this misspelling of names, apparently
on a phonetic basis, was caused by a reading-spelling disability from
which Oswald appeared to suffer.96 Other evidence of the existence of
such a disability is provided by the many other misspellings that
appear in Oswald's writings, portions of which are quoted below.
</p> <p>Sometime during this period, and under circumstances to be
discussed more fully below, Oswald started to read Communist litera-
</p> <p><b>Page 384</b>
</p> <p>ture, which he obtained from the public library.97 One of his fellow
employees, Palmer McBride, stated that Oswald said he would like to
kill President Eisenhower because he was exploiting the working class.
98 Oswald praised Khrushchev and suggested that he and McBride join
the Communist Party "to take advantage of their social functions." 99
Oswald also became interested in the New Orleans Amateur Astronomy
Association, an organization of high school students. The
association's then president, William E. Wulf, testified that he
remembered an occasion when Oswald</p>
    <blockquote>... started expounding the Communist doctrine and saying that he
was highly interested in communism, that communism was the only way of
life for the worker, et cetera, and then came out with a statement
that he was looking for a Communist cell in town to join but he
couldn't find any. He was a little dismayed at this, and he said that
he couldn't find any that would show any interest in him as a
Communist, and subsequently, after this conversation, my father came
in and we were kind of arguing back and forth about the situation, and
my father came in the room, heard what we were arguing on communism,
and that this boy was loud-mouthed, boisterous, and my father asked
him to leave the house and politely put him out of the house, and that
is the last I have seen or spoken with Oswald. 100</blockquote>
<p>
Despite this apparent interest in communism, Oswald tried to join
the Marines when he was 16 years old.101 This was 1 year before his
actual enlistment and just a little over 2.5 years after he left New
York. He wrote a note in his mother's name to school authorities in
New Orleans saying that he was leaving school because he and his
mother were moving to San Diego. In fact, he had quit school in an
attempt to obtain his mother's assistance to join the Marines.102
While he apparently was able to induce his mother to make a false
statement about his age he was nevertheless unable to convince the
proper authorities that he was really 17 years old.103 There is
evidence that Oswald was greatly influenced in his decision to join
the Marines by the fact that his brother Robert had done so
approximately 3 years before. 104 Robert Oswald had given his Marine
Corps manual to his brother Lee, who studied it during the year
following his unsuccessful attempt to enlist until "He knew it by
heart." 105 According to Marguerite Oswald, "Lee lived for the time
that he would become 17 years old to join the Marines--that whole
year." 106 In John Pic's view, Oswald was motivated to join the
Marines in large part by a desire "to get from out and under ... the
yoke of oppression from my mother." 107
</p> <p>Oswald's inability or lack of desire to enter into meaningful
relationships with other people continued during this period in New
Orleans (1954-56). 108 It probably contributed greatly to the general
dissatisfaction which he exhibited with his environment, a
dissatisfaction which seemed to find expression at this particular
point in his
</p> <p><b>Page 385</b>
</p> <p>intense desire to join the Marines and get away from his surroundings
and his mother. His study of Communist literature, which might appear
to be inconsistent with his desire to join the Marines, could have
been another manifestation of Oswald's rejection of his
environment.109
</p> <p>His difficulty in relating to other people and his general
dissatisfaction with the world around him continued while he was in
the Marine Corps. Kerry Thornley, a marine associate, who, shortly
after Oswald's defection, wrote an as yet unpublished novel based in
considerable part on Oswald's life, testified that "definitely the
Marine Corps was not what he had expected it to be when he joined." He
said that Oswald "seemed to guard against developing real close
friendships." 110 Daniel Powers, another marine who was stationed with
Oswald for part of his marine career, testified that Oswald seemed
"always [to be] striving for a relationship, but whenever he did ...
his general personality would alienate the group against him."  Other
marines also testified that Oswald had few friends and kept very much
to himself. 112
</p> <p>While there is nothing in Oswald's military records to indicate
that he was mentally unstable or otherwise psychologically unfit for
duty in the Marine Corps, 113 he did not adjust well to conditions
which he found in that service. 114 He did not rise above the rank of
private first class, even though he had passed a qualifying
examination for the rank of corporal.115 His Marine career was not
helped by his attitude that he was a man of great ability and
intelligence and that many of his superiors in the Marine Corps were
not sufficiently competent to give him orders.116 While Oswald did not
seem to object to authority in the abstract, he did think that he
should be the one to exercise it. John E. Donovan, one of his former
officers, testified that Oswald thought "that authority, particularly
the Marine Corps, ought to be able to recognize talent such as his
own, without a given magic college degree, and put them in positions
of prominence? 117 Oswald manifested this feeling about authority by
baiting his officers. He led them into discussions of foreign affairs
about which they often knew less than he did, since he had apparently
devoted considerable time to a study of such matters.118 When the
officers were unable to discuss foreign affairs satisfactorily with
him, Oswald regarded them as unfit to exercise command over him.119
Nelson Delgado, one of Oswald's fellow Marines, testified that Oswald
tried to "cut up anybody that was high ranking" in those arguments
"and make himself come out top dog.". 120 Oswald probably engaged his
superiors in arguments on a subject that he had studied in an attempt
to attract attention to himself and to support his exaggerated idea of
his own abilities.
</p> <p>Thornley also testified that he thought that Oswald's extreme
personal sloppiness in the Marine Corps "fitted into a general
personality pattern of his: to do whatever was not wanted of him, a
recalcitrant trend in his personality." 121 Oswald "seemed to be a
person who would go out of his way to get into trouble" 122 and then
used the "special treatment" he received as an example of the way in
which
</p> <p><b>Page 386</b>
</p> <p>he was being picked on and "as a means of getting or attempting to get
sympathy." 123 In Thornley's view, Oswald labored under a persecution
complex which he strove to maintain and "felt the Marine Corps kept a
pretty close watch on him because of his 'subversive' activities."
Thornley added: "I think it was kind of necessary to him to believe
that he was being picked on. It wasn't anything extreme. I wouldn't go
as far as to call it, call him a paranoid, but a definite tendency
there was in that direction, I think." 124
</p> <p>Powers considered Oswald to be meek and easily led,125 an
"individual that you would brainwash, and quite easy ... [but] I
think once he believed in something ... he stood in his beliefs."
126 Powers also testified that Oswald was reserved and seemed to be
"somewhat the frail, little puppy in the litter." 127 He had the
nickname "Ozzie Rabbit." 128
</p> <p>Oswald read a good deal, said Powers, but "he would never be
reading any of the shoot-em-up westerns or anything like that.
Normally, it would be a good type of literature; and the one that I
recall was 'Leaves of Grass,' by Wait Whitman." 129 According to
Powers, Oswald said: "All the Marine Corps did was to teach you to
kill and after you got out of the Marines you might be good
gangsters." 130 Powers believed that when Oswald arrived in Japan he
acquired a girlfriend, "finally attaining a male status or image in
his own eyes." 131 That apparently caused Oswald to become more
self-confident, aggressive and even somewhat pugnacious, although
Powers "wouldn't say that this guy is a troublemaker." 132 Powers said
"now he was Oswald the man rather than Oswald the rabbit." 133 Oswald
once told Powers that he didn't care if he returned to the United
States at all. 134
</p> <p>While in Japan, Oswald's new found apparent self confidence and
pugnaciousness led to an incident in which he spilled a drink on one
of his sergeants and abusively challenged him to fight.135 At the
court-martial hearing which followed, Oswald admitted that he had been
rather drunk when the incident occurred. He testified that he had felt
the sergeant had a grudge against him and that he had unsuccessfully
sought a transfer from the sergeant's unit. He said that he had simply
wanted to discuss the question with the sergeant and the drink had
been spilled accidentally. The hearing officer agreed with the latter
claim but found Oswald guilty of wrongfully using provoking words and
sentenced him to 28 days, canceling the suspension of a 20-day
sentence that Oswald had received in an earlier court-martial for
possessing an unauthorized pistol with which he had accidentally shot
himself.136
</p> <p>At his own request, Oswald was transferred from active duty to the
Marine Corps Reserve under honorable conditions in September of 1959,
3 months prior to his regularly scheduled separation date, 137
ostensibly to care for his mother who had been injured in an accident
at her work.138 He was undesirably discharged from the Marine Corps
Reserve, to which he had been assigned on inactive status following
his transfer from active duty, after it was learned that he had
</p> <p><b>Page 387</b>
</p> <p>defected to the Soviet Union.139 In an attempt to have this discharge
reversed, Oswald wrote to then Secretary of the Navy Connally on
January 30, 1962, stating that he would "employ all means to right
this gross mistake or injustice."
</p> <p>Governor Connally had just resigned to run for Governor of Texas,
so he advised Oswald that he had forwarded the letter to his
successor.141 It is thus clear that Oswald knew that Governor Connally
was never directly concerned with his discharge and he must have known
that President Kennedy had had nothing to do with it. In that
connection, it does not appear that Oswald ever expressed any
dissatisfaction of any kind with either the President or Governor
Connally.142 Marina Oswald testified that she "had never heard
anything bad about Kennedy from Lee. And he never had anything against
him." 143 Mrs. Oswald said that her husband did not say anything about
Governor Connally after his return to the United States. She
testified: "But while we were in Russia he spoke well of him. ...
Lee said that when he would return to the United States he would vote
for him [for Governor]." 144 Oswald must have already learned that the
Governor could not help him with his discharge because he was no
longer Secretary of the Navy, at the time he made that remark.
</p> <p>Even though Oswald apparently did not express any hostility
against the President or Governor Connally, he continued to be
concerned about his undesirable discharge.145 It is clear that he
thought he had been unjustly treated. Probably his complaint was due
to the fact that his discharge was not related to anything he had done
while on active duty and also because he had not received any notice
of the original discharge proceedings, since his whereabouts were not
known.146  He continued his efforts to reverse the discharge by
petitioning the Navy Discharge Review Board, which finally declined to
modify the discharge and so advised him in a letter dated July
1963.147</p>
<p>Governor Connally's connection with the discharge, although
indirect, caused the Commission to consider whether he might have been
Oswald's real target. In that connection, it should be noted that
Marina Oswald testified on September 6, 1964, that she thought her
husband "was shooting at Connally rather than President Kennedy." In
support of her conclusion Mrs. Oswald noted her husband's undesirable
discharge and that she could not think of any reason why Oswald would
want to kill President Kennedy.148 It should be noted, however, that
at the time Oswald fired the shots at the Presidential limousine the
Governor occupied the seat in front of the President, and it would
have been almost impossible for Oswald to have hit the Governor
without hitting the President first. Oswald could have shot the
Governor as the car approached the Depository or as it was making the
turn onto Elm Street. Once it had started down Elm Street toward the
Triple Underpass, however, the President almost completely blocked
Oswald's view of the Governor prior to the time the first shot struck
the President.150 Furthermore, Oswald would have had other and more
favorable opportunities to strike at the Governor than on this
occasion
</p><b>Page 388</b>
<p>when, as a member of the President's party, he had more protection
than usual. It would appear, therefore, that to the extent Oswald's
undesirable discharge affected his motivation, it was more in terms of
a general hostility against the government and its representatives
rather than a grudge against any particular person.</p>

  <p><a href="chapter-7.html#top" name="interest">Return to Top</a></p> <p>
<b>Interest in Marxism</b>
</p> <p>As indicated above, Oswald started to read Communist literature
after he and his mother left New York and moved to New Orleans.151 He
told Aline Mosby, a reporter who interviewed him after he arrived in
Moscow:</p>
    <blockquote>I'm a Marxist, ... I became interested about the age of 15. From
an ideological viewpoint. An old lady handed me a pamphlet about
saving the Rosenbergs. ... I looked at that paper and I still
remember it for some reason, I don't know why.152</blockquote>

<p>
Oswald studied Marxism after he joined the Marines and his sympathies
in that direction and for the Soviet Union appear to have been widely
known, at least in the unit to which he was assigned after his return
from the Far East. His interest in Russia led some of his associates
to call him "comrade" 153 or "Oswaldskovitch." 154 He always wanted to
play the red pieces in chess because, as he said in an apparently
humorous context, he preferred the "Red Army." 155 He studied the
Russian language,156 read a Russian language newspaper 157 and seemed
interested in what was going on in the Soviet Union.158 Thornley, who
thought Oswald had an "irrevocable conviction" that his Marxist
beliefs were correct, testified:</p>
    <blockquote>I think you could sit down and argue with him for a number of
years ... and I don't think you could have changed his mind on that
unless you knew why he believed it in the first place. I certainly
don't. I don't think with any kind of formal argument you could have
shaken that conviction. And that is why I say irrevocable. It was
just--never getting back to looking at things from any other way once
he had become a Marxist, whenever that was.159</blockquote>
<p>
Thornley also testified about an incident which grew out of a
combination of Oswald's known Marxist sympathies and George Orwell's
book "1984," one of Oswald's favorite books which Thornley read at
Oswald's suggestion. Shortly after Thornley finished reading that book
the Marine unit to which both men were assigned was required to take
part in a Saturday morning parade in honor of some retiring
noncommissioned officers, an event which they both approached with
little enthusiasm. While waiting for the parade to start they talked
briefly about "1984" even though Oswald seemed to be lost in his own
thoughts. After a brief period of silence Os-
</p> <p><b>Page 389</b>
</p> <p>wald remarked on the stupidity of the parade and on how angry it made
him, to which Thornley replied: "Well, comes the revolution you will
change all that." Thornley testified:</p>
    <blockquote>At which time he looked at me like a betrayed Caesar and screamed,
screamed definitely, "Not you, too, Thornley." And I remember his
voice cracked as he said this. He was definitely disturbed at what I
had said and I didn't really think I had said that much. ... I never
said anything to him again and he never said anything to me again.160</blockquote>
<p>
Thornley said that he had made his remark only in the context of
"1984" and had not intended any criticism of Oswald's political views
which is the way in which, Thornley thought, Oswald took his
remarks.161
</p> <p>Lieutenant Donovan testified that Oswald thought that "there were
many grave injustices concerning the affairs in the international
situation." He recalled that Oswald had a specific interest in Latin
America, particularly Cuba, and expressed opposition to the Batista
regime and sympathy for Castro, an attitude which, Donovan said, was
"not ... unpopular" at that time. Donovan testified that he never
heard Oswald express a desire personally to take part in the
elimination of injustices anywhere in the world and that he "never
heard him in any way, shape or form confess that he was a Communist,
or that he ever thought about being a Communist." 162 Delgado
testified that Oswald was "a complete believer that our way of
government was not quite right" and believed that our Government did
not have "too much to offer," but was not in favor of "the Communist
way of life." Delgado and Oswald talked more about Cuba than Russia,
and sometimes imagined themselves as leaders in the Cuban Army or
Government, who might "lead an expedition to some of these other
islands and free them too." 163
</p> <p>Thornley also believed that Oswald's Marxist beliefs led to an
extraordinary view of history under which:</p>

    <blockquote>He looked upon the eyes of future people as some kind of tribunal,
and he wanted to be on the winning side so that 10,000 years from-now
people would look in the history books and say, "Well, this man was
ahead of his time." ... The eyes of the future became ... the eyes
of God.... He was concerned with his image in history and I do
think that is why he chose ... the particular method [of defecting]
he chose and did it in the way he did. It got him in the newspapers.
It did broadcast his name out.164</blockquote>
<p>
Thornley thought that Oswald not only wanted a place in history but
also wanted to live comfortably in the present. He testified that if
Oswald could not have that "degree of physical comfort that he
expected or sought, I think he would then throw himself entirely on
the other thing he also wanted, which was the image in history. ...
</p> <p><b>Page 390</b>
</p> <p>I think he wanted both if he could have them. If he didn't, he wanted
to die with the knowledge that, or with the idea that he was
somebody." 165
</p> <p>Oswald's interest in Marxism led some people to avoid him, even
though as his wife suggested, that interest may have been motivated by
a desire to gain attention.166 He used his Marxist  and associated
activities as excuses for his difficulties in getting along in the
world, which were usually caused by entirely different factors. His
use of those excuses to present himself to the world as a person who
was being unfairly treated is shown most clearly by his employment
relations after his return from the Soviet Union. Of course, he made
his real problems worse to the extent that his use of those excuses
prevented him from discovering the real reasons for and attempting to
overcome his difficulties. Of greater importance, Oswald's commitment
to Marxism contributed to the decisions which led him to defect to the
Soviet Union in 1959, and later to engage in activities on behalf of
the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in the summer of 1963, and to attempt
to go to Cuba late in September of that year.
</p> <p><a href="chapter-7.html#top" name="defection">Return to Top</a></p> <p>
<b>Defection to the Soviet Union</b>
</p> <p>After Oswald left the Marine Corps in September of 1959,
ostensibly to care for his mother, he almost immediately left for the
Soviet Union where he attempted to renounce his citizenship. At the
age of 19, Oswald thus committed an act which was the most striking
indication he had yet given of his willingness to act on his beliefs
in quite extraordinary ways.
</p> <p>While his defection resulted in part from Oswald's commitment to
Marxism, it appears that personal and psychological factors were also
involved. On August 17, 1963, Oswald told Mr. William Stuckey, who had
arranged a radio debate on Oswald's activities on behalf of the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee, that while he had begun to read Marx and
Engels at the age of 15, the conclusive thing that made him decide that Marxism was the answer
was his service in Japan. He said living conditions over there
convinced him something was wrong with the system, and that possibly
Marxism was the answer. He said it was in Japan that he made up his
mind to go to Russia and see for himself how a revolutionary society
operates, a Marxist society.167
</p> <p>On the other hand, at least one person who knew Oswald after his
return thought that his defection had a more personal and
psychological basis.168 The validity of the latter observation is
borne out by some of the things Oswald wrote in connection with his
defection indicating that his motivation was at least in part a
personal one. On November 26, 1959, shortly after he arrived in the
Soviet Union, and probably before Soviet authorities had given him
permission to stay indefinitely, he wrote to his brother Robert that
the Soviet Union
</p> <p><b>Page 391</b>
</p> <p>was a country which "I have always considered ... to be my own" and
that he went there "only to find freedom. ... I could never have
been personally happy in the U.S." 169  He wrote in another letter
that he would "never return to the United States which is a country I
hate." 170  His idea that he was to find "freedom" in the Soviet Union
was to be rudely shattered.
</p> <p>Whatever Oswald's reasons for going to the Soviet Union might have
been, however, there can be little doubt that his desire to go was
quite strong. In addition to studying the Russian language while he
was in the Marines, Oswald had managed to save enough money to cover
the expenses of his forthcoming trip. While there is no proof that he
saved $1,500, as he claimed, it would have taken considerable
discipline to save whatever amount was required to finance his
defection out of the salary of a low ranking enlisted man.171
</p> <p>The extent of Oswald's desire to go to the Soviet Union and of his
initial commitment to that country can best be understood, however, in
the context of his concomitant hatred of the United States, which was
most clearly expressed in his November 26, 1959, letter to his brother
Robert. Addressing himself to the question of why "I and my fellow
workers and communist's would like to see the present capitalist
government of the U.S. overthrown" Oswald stated that that government
supported an economic system "which exploits all its workers" and
under which "art, culture and the sprit of man are subjected to
commercial enterpraising, [and] religion and education are used as a
tool to surpress what would otherwise be a population questioning
their government's unfair economic system and plans for war." 172
</p> <p>He complained in his letter about segregation, unemployment,
automation, and the use of military forces to suppress other
populations. Asking his brother why he supported the American
Government and what ideals he put forward, Oswald wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>Ask me and I will tell you I fight for communism. ... I will not say
your grandchildren will live under communism, look for yourself at
history, look at a world map! America is a dicing country, I do not
wish to be a part of it, nor do I ever again wish to be used as a tool
in its military aggressions.<br>
This should answer your question, and also give you a glimpse of
my way of thinking.<br>
So you speak of advantages. Do you think that is why I am here?
For personal, material advantages? Happiness is not based on oneself,
it does not consist of a small home, of taking and getting, Happiness
is taking part in the struggle, where there is no borderline between
one's own personal world, and the world in general. I never believed I
would find more material advantages at this stage of development in
the Soviet Union than I might of had in the U.S.
&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;
</blockquote>
<p> 
<b>Page 392</b></p>
    <blockquote>I have been a pro-communist for years and yet I have never met a
communist, instead I kept silent and observed, and what I observed
plus my Marxist learning brought me here to the Soviet Union. I have
always considered this country to be my own.173</blockquote>
<p>
Responding to Robert's statement that he had not "renounced" him,
Oswald told his brother "on what terms I want this arrangement." He
advised Robert that:</p>
    <ol><li>In the event of war I would kill any american who put a uniform
on in defense of the american government-- any american.</li>
    <li>That in my own mind I have no attachment's of any kind in the U.S.</li>
    <li>That I want to, and I shall, live a normal happy and peaceful
life here in the Soviet Union for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li>That my mother and you are (in spite of what the newspaper
said) not objects of affection, but only examples of workers in the U.S.
</li></ol><p>
Despite this commitment to the Soviet Union Oswald met
disappointments there just as he had in the past. At the outset the
Soviets told him that he could not remain. It seems that Oswald
immediately attempted suicide--a striking indication of how much he
desired to remain in the Soviet Union.175 It shows how willing he was
to act dramatically and decisively when he faced an emotional crisis
with few readily available alternatives at hand. He was shocked to
find that the Soviet Union did not accept him with open arms. The
entry in his self-styled "Historic Diary" for October 21, 1959,
reports:</p>
    <blockquote>I am shocked!! My dreams! ... I have waited for 2 year to be
accepted. My fondes dreams are shattered because of a petty official,
... I decide to end it. Soak fist in cold water to numb the pain,
Than slash my leftwrist. Than plaug wrist into bathtub of hot water.... 
Somewhere, a violin plays, as I watch my life whirl away. I think
to myself "How easy to Die" and "A Sweet Death, (to violins) ... 176</blockquote>
<p>
Oswald was discovered in time to thwart his attempt at suicide. 177 He
was taken to a hospital in Moscow where he was kept until October 28,
1959.178
</p> <p>Still intent, however, on staying in the Soviet Union, Oswald went
on October 31, to the American Embassy to renounce his U.S.
citizenship. Mr. Richard E. Snyder, then Second Secretary and senior
consular official at the Embassy, testified that Oswald was extremely
sure of himself and seemed "to know what his mission was. He took
charge, in a sense, of the conversation right from the beginning." He
presented the following signed note:</p>
    <blockquote>I Lee Harvey Oswald do hereby request that my present citizenship
in the United States of America, be revoked.</blockquote>
<b>Page 393</b>
    <blockquote>I have entered the Soviet Union for the express purpose of
applying for citizenship in the Soviet Union, through the means of
naturalization.<br>
	My request for citizenship is now pending before the Surprem
Soviet of the U.S.S.R.<br>
	I take these steps for political reasons. My request for the
revoking of my American citizenship is made only after the longest and
most serious considerations.<br>
	I affirm that my allegiance is to the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics.180 (See Commission Exhibit 913, p. 261.)</blockquote>
<p>
As his "principal reason" for renouncing his citizenship Oswald
stated: "I am a Marxist." 181  He also alluded to hardships endured by
his mother as a worker, referring to them as experiences that he did
not intend to have himself,182 even though he stated that he had never
held a civilian job.183 He said that his Marine service in Okinawa and
elsewhere had given him "a chance to observe 'American imperialism.'"
but he also displayed some sensitivity at not having reached a higher
rank in the Marine Corps.184 He stated that he had volunteered to give
Soviet officials any information that he had concerning Marine Corps
operations,185 and intimated that he might know something of special
interest.186 Oswald's "Historic Diary" describes the event in part as
follows:</p>
    <blockquote>I leave Embassy, elated at this showdown, returning to my hotel I
feel now my enorgies are not spent in vain. I'm sure Russians will
except me after this sign of my faith in them.187</blockquote>

<p>
The Soviet authorities finally permitted Oswald to remain in their
country.188 No evidence has been found that they used him for any
particular propaganda or other political or informational purposes.
They sent him to Minsk to work in a radio and television factory as a
metal worker.189 The Soviet authorities denied Oswald permission to
attend a university in Moscow,190 but they gave him a monthly
allowance of 700 rubles a month (old exchange rate)191 in addition to
his factory salary of approximately equal amount 192 and considerably
better living quarters than those accorded to Soviet citizens of equal
age and station.193 The subsidy, apparently similar to those sometimes
given to foreigners allowed to remain in the Soviet Union, together
with his salary, gave Oswald an income which he said approximated that
of the director of the factory in which he worked.194
</p> <p>Even though he received more money and better living quarters than
other Russians doing similar work, he envied his wife's uncle, a
colonel in the MVD, because of the larger apartment in which he lived.
Reminiscent of his attitude toward his superiors in the Marine Corps,
Oswald apparently resented the exercise of authority over him and the
better treatment afforded to Communist Party officials.195 After he
returned to the United States he took the position that the Communist
Party officials in the Soviet Union were opportunists who
</p> <p><b>Page 394</b>
</p> <p>were betraying their positions for personal gain. He is reported to
have expressed the conclusion that they had "fat stinking politicians
over there just like we have over here." 196
</p> <p>Oswald apparently continued to have personal difficulties while he
was in Minsk. Although Marina Oswald told the Commission that her
husband had good personal relationships in the Soviet Union,197
Katherine Ford, one of the members of the Russian community in Dallas
with which the Oswalds became acquainted upon their arrival in the
United States, stated that Mrs. Oswald told her everybody in Russia
"hated him." 198 Jeanne De Mohrenschildt, another member of that
group, said that Oswald told her that he had returned because "I
didn't find what I was looking for." 199 George De Mohrenschildt
thought that Oswald must have become disgusted with life in the Soviet
Union as the novelty of the presence of an American wore off and he
began to be less the center of attention.200
</p> <p>The best description of Oswald's state of mind, however, is set
forth in his own "Historic Diary." Under the entry for May 1, 1960, he
noted that one of his acquaintances "relats many things I do not know
about the U.S.S.R.. I begin to feel uneasy inside, its true!" 201
Under the entry for August-September of that year he wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>As my Russian improves I become increasingly conscious of just
what sort of a society I live in. Mass gymnastics, complusory
afterwork meeting, usually political information meeting. Complusory
attendance at lectures and the sending of the entire shop collective
(except me) to pick potatoes on a Sunday, at a state collective farm:
A "patroict duty" to bring in the harvest. The opions of the workers
(unvoiced) are that its a great pain in the neck: they don't seem to
be esspicialy enthusiastic about any of the "collective" duties a
natural feeling. I am increasingly aware of the presence, in all
thing, of Lebizen, shop party secretary, fat, fortyish, and jovial on
the outside. He is a no-nonsense party regular.202</blockquote>
<p>
Finally, the entry of January 4-31 of 1961:</p>
    <blockquote>I am stating to reconsider my disire about staying the work is
drab the money I get has nowhere to be spent. No night clubs or
bowling allys no places of recreation acept the trade union dances I
have have had enough.203</blockquote>
<p>
Shortly thereafter, less than 18 months after his defection, about 6
weeks before he met Marina Prusakova, Oswald opened negotiations with
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow looking toward his return to the United
States.204
</p> <p><a href="chapter-7.html#top" name="us">Return to Top</a></p> <p>
<b>Return to the United States</b>
</p> <p>In view of the intensity of his earlier commitment to the Soviet
Union, a great change must have occurred in Oswald's thinking to
</p> <p><b>395</b>
</p> <p>induce him to return to the United States. The psychological effects
of that change must have been highly unsettling. It should be
remembered that he was not yet 20 years old when he went to the Soviet
Union with such high hopes and not quite 23 when he returned bitterly
disappointed. His attempt to renounce his citizenship had been an open
expression of hostility against the United States and a profound
rejection of his early life. The dramatic break with society in
America now had to be undone. His return to the United States publicly
testified to the utter failure of what had been the most important act
of his life.
</p> <p>Marina Oswald confirmed the fact that her husband was experiencing
psychological difficulties at the time of his return. She said that
"immediately after coming to the United States Lee changed. I did not
know him as such a man in Russia." 205 She added that while he helped
her as he had done before, he became more of a recluse, that "[he] was
very irritable, sometimes for a trifle" and that "Lee was very
unrestrained and very explosive" during the period from November 19,
1962 to March of 1963.206
</p> <p>After the assassination she wrote that:</p>
    <blockquote>In general, our family life began to deteriorate after we arrived
in America. Lee was always hot-tempered, and now this trait of
character more and more prevented us from living together in harmony.
Lee became very irritable, and sometimes some completely trivial thing
would drive him into a rage. I myself do not have a particularly quiet
disposition, but I had to change my character a great deal in order to
maintain a more or less peaceful family life.207</blockquote>
<p>
Marina Oswald's judgment of her husband's state of mind may be
substantiated by comparing material which he wrote in the Soviet Union
with what he wrote while on the way back to the United States and
after his return. While in the Soviet Union he wrote his longest and
clearest piece of work, "The Collective." This was a fairly coherent
description of life in that country, basically centered around the
radio and television factory in which he worked.208 While it was
apparently intended for publication in the United States, and is in
many respects critical of certain aspects of life in the Soviet Union,
it appears to be the work of a fairly well organized person. Oswald
prefaced his manuscript with a short autobiographical sketch which
reads in part as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>Lee Harvey Oswald was born in Oct 1939 in New Orleans La. the son
of a Insuraen Salesmen whose early death left a far mean streak of
indepence brought on by negleck. entering the US Marine corp at 17
this streak of independence was strengthed by exotic journeys to Japan

    <blockquote>in the USMC he abonded his american life to seek a new life in the
USSR. full of optimism and hope he stood in red square in the fall of
1959 vowing to see his chosen course through, after, however, two
years and a lot of growing up I decided to return to the USA. ... 209</blockquote>
<p>
"The Collective" contrasts sharply with material which Oswald
seems to have written after he left the Soviet Union,210 which appears
to be more an expression of his own psychological condition than of a
reasoned analysis. The latter material expresses great hostility to
both communism and capitalism. He wrote, that to a person knowing both
of those systems, "their can be no mediation between those systems as
they exist to-day and that person. He must be opposed to their basic
foundations and representatives" 211</p>
    <blockquote>and yet it is immature to take the sort of attitude which says "a curse
on both your houses!" their are two great representative of power in
the world, simply expressed, the left and right, and their offspring
factions and concerns.<br>
any practical attempt at one alternative must have as its nuclus the
triditionall ideological best of both systems, and yet be utterly
opposed to both systems.212</blockquote>
<p>
Such an alternative was to be opposed both to capitalism and communism
because:</p>
    <blockquote>No man, having known, having lived, under the Russian Communist
and American capitalist system, could possibly make a choice between
them, there is no choice, one offers oppresstion the other poverty.
Both offer imperilistic injustice, tinted with two brands of
slavery.213</blockquote>
<p>
Oswald actually did attempt to formulate such an alternative 214
which he planned to "put forward" himself.215 He thought the new
alternative would have its best chance to be accepted after "conflict
between the two world systems leaves the world country without defense
or foundation of government,"216 after which the survivors would "seek
a alternative opposed to those systems which have brough them misery."
217 Oswald realized that "their thinking and education will be steeped
in the traditions of those systems [and] they would never except a
'new order' complete beyond their understanding." 218 As a result he
thought it would be "neccary to oppose the old systems but at the same
time support their cherished tractions." 219
</p> <p>Expanding on his ideas on how his alternative to communism and
capitalism might be introduced, he wrote of a "readily foreseeable ... 
economic, political or military crisis, internal or external,
[which] will bring about the final destruction of the capitalist.
system," 220 and indicated that "preparation in a special party could
safeguard an inde-
</p> <p><b>Page 398</b>
</p> <p>pendant course of action after the debacle," 221 which would achieve
the goal, which was:</p>
    <blockquote>The emplacement of a separate, democratic, pure communist society
... but one with union-communes, democratic socializing of
production and without regard to the twisting apart of Marxism Marxist
Communism by other powers.222</blockquote>
<p>
While "[r]esoufualniss and patient working towards the aforesaid
goal's are preferred rather than loud and useless manifestation's of
protest," 223 Oswald went on to note:</p>
    <blockquote>But these preferred tactics now, may prove to be too limited in the
near future, they should not be confused with slowness, indecision or
fear, only the intellectually fearless could even be remotely attracted
too our doctrine, and yet this doctrine requires the utmost utmost
restraint, a state of being in itself majustic in power.224</blockquote>
<p>
Oswald's decided rejection of both capitalism and communism seemed
to place him in a situation in which he could not live with
satisfaction either in the United States or in the Soviet Union. The
discussion above has already set forth examples of his expression of
hatred for the United States. He also expressed hatred of the Soviet
Union and of the Communist Party, U.S.A., even though he later
referred to the latter as "trusted long time fighters for progress."
225 He wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>The Communist Party of the United States has betrayed itself! it
has turned itself into the tradional lever of a foreign power to
overthrow the government of the United States; not in the name of
freedom or high ideals, but in servile conformity to the wishes of the
Soviet Union and in anticipation of Soviet Russia's complete
domination of the American continent.226<br>
&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;<br>
There can be no sympathy for those who have turned the idea of
communism into a vill curse to western man.<br>
The Soviets have committed crimes unsurpassed even by their early
day capitalist counterparts, the imprisonment of their own peoples,
with the mass extermination so typical of Stalin, and the individual
surpresstion and regimentation under Krushehev.<br>
The deportations, the purposeful curtailment of diet in the
consumer slighted population of Russia, the murder of history, the
prositution of art and culture.227</blockquote>
<p>
A suggestion that Oswald hated more than just capitalism and
communism is provided by the following, which was apparently written
either on the ship coming back, or after his return from the Soviet
Union:
</p> <p><b>Page 399</b></p>
	<blockquote>I have often wondered why it is that the communist, anarchist
capitalist and even the fascist and anarchist elements in american,
allways profess patrotistism toward the land and the people, if not
the government; although their ideals movements must surly lead to the
bitter destruction of all and everything.<br>
	I am quite sure these people must hate not only the government but
our the peop culture, traditions, heritage and very people itself, and
yet they stand up and piously pronouce themselfs patriots, displaying
their war medles, that they gained in conflicts long past between
themselfs.<br>
	I wonder what would happen it somebody was to stand up and say he
was utterly opposed not only to the governments, but to the people, too
the entire land and complete foundations of his socically.228</blockquote>
<p>
Oswald demonstrated his thinking in connection with his return to
the United States by preparing two sets of identical questions of the
type which he might have thought he would be asked at  a press
conference when he returned. With either great ambivalence, or cold
calculation he prepared completely different answers to the same
questions. Judged by his other statements and writings, however, he
appears to have indicated his true feelings in the set of answers
first presented and to have stated in the second what he thought would
be least harmful to him as he resumed life in the United States. For
example, in response to his questions about his decision to go to the
Soviet Union, his first draft answered "as a mark of discuss and
protest against american political policies in foreign countrys, my
personal sign of discontent' and horror at the misguided line of
resoning of the U.S. Government." 229 His second answer was that he
"went as a citizen of the U.S. (as a tourist) residing in a forieng
country which I have a perfect fight to do. I went there to see the
land, the people and how their system works."
</p> <p>To the question of "Are you a communits?" he first answered "Yes,
basically, allthough I hate the USSR and socialist system I still
think marxism can work under different circumstances." 231 His second
answer to this question was, "No of course not, I have never even know
a communist, outside of the ones in the USSR but you can't help that."
282 His first set of questions and answers indicated his belief that
there were no outstanding differences between the Soviet Union and the
United States, "except in the US, the living standard is a little
higher. freedoms are about the same, medical aid and the educational
system in the USSR is better than in the USA." In the second simulated
transcript which ended with the statement "Newspapers, thank you sir;
you are a real patriot!!" he apparently concluded that the United
States offered "freedom of speech travel outspoken opposition to
unpopular policies freedom to believe in god," while the Soviet Union
did not.234
</p> <p><b>Page 400</b>
</p> <p>Despite the hatred that Oswald expressed toward the Soviet Union
after his residence there, he continued to be interested in that
country after he returned to the United States. Soon after his arrival
he wrote to the Soviet Embassy in Washington requesting information on
how to subscribe to Russian newspapers and magazines and asked for
"any periodicals or bulletins which you may put out for the beneifit
of your citizens living, for a time, in the U.S.A.." 235 Oswald
subsequently did subscribe to several Soviet journals. 236 While
Marina Oswald tried to obtain permission to return to the Soviet Union
she testified that she did so at her husband's insistence.237
</p> <p>In July of 1963, Oswald also requested the Soviet Union to provide
a visa for his return to that country.238 In August of 1963, he gave
the New Orleans police as a reason for refusing to permit his family
to learn English, that ~'he hated America and he did not want them to
become 'Americanized' and that his plans were to go back to Russia."
239 Even though his primary purpose probably was to get to Cuba, he
sought an immediate grant of visa on his trip to Mexico City in late
September of 1963.240 He also inquired about visas for himself and his
wife in a letter which he wrote to the Soviet Embassy in Washington on
November 9, 1963.241
</p> <p><a href="chapter-7.html#top" name="personal">Return to Top</a></p> <p>
<b>Personal Relations</b>
</p> <p>Apart from his relatives, Oswald had no friends or close
associates in Texas when he returned there in June of 1962, and he did
not establish any close friendships or associations, although it
appears that he came to respect George De Mohrenschildt.242 Somewhat
of a nonconformist,243 De Mohrenschildt was a peripheral member of the
so-called Russian community, with which Oswald made contact through
Mr. Peter Gregory, a Russian-speaking petroleum engineer whom Oswald
met as a result of his contact with the Texas Employment Commission
office in Fort Worth.244 Some of the members of that group saw a good
deal of the Oswalds through the fall of 1963, and attempted to help
Mrs. Oswald particularly, in various ways.245 In general, Oswald did
not like the member's of the Russian community.246 In fact, his
relations with some of them, particularly George Bouhe, became quite
hostile.247 Part of the problem resulted from the fact that, as Jeanne
De Mohrenschildt testified, Oswald was "very, very disagreeable and
disappointed." 248 He also expressed considerable resentment at the
help given to his wife by her Russian-American friends. Jeanne De
Mohrenschildt said:</p>
    <blockquote>Marina had a hundred dresses given to her ... [and] he objected to
that lavish help, because Marina was throwing it into his face.<br>
	He was offensive with the people. And I can understand why, ...
because that hurt him. He could never give her what the</blockquote>
<b>Page 401</b>
    <blockquote>people were showering on her. ... no matter how hard he worked--and
he worked very hard.249</blockquote>
<p>
The relations between Oswald and his wife became such that Bouhe
wanted to "liberate" her from Oswald.250 While the exact sequence of
events is not clear because of conflicting testimony, it appears that
De Mohrenschildt and his wife actually went to Oswald's apartment
early in November of 1962 and helped to move the personal effects of
Marina Oswald and the baby. Even though it appears that they may have
left Oswald a few days before, it seems that he resisted the move as
best he could. He even threatened to tear up his wife's dresses and
break all the baby things. According to De Mohrenschildt, Oswald
submitted to the inevitable, presumably because he was "small, you
know, and he was rather a puny individual." 251 De Mohrenschildt said
that the whole affair made him nervous since he was "interfering in
other people's affairs, after all." 252
</p> <p>Oswald attempted to get his wife to come back and, over Bouhe's
protest, De Mohrenschildt finally told him where she was. De
Mohrenschildt admitted that:</p>
    <blockquote>if somebody did that to me, a lousy trick like that, to take my wife
away, and all the furniture, I would be mad as hell, too. I am
surprised that he didn't do something worse.253</blockquote>
<p>
After about a 2-week separation, Marina Oswald returned to her
husband.254 Bouhe thoroughly disapproved of this and as a result
almost all communication between the Oswalds and members of the
Russian community ceased. Contacts with De Mohrenschildt and his wife
did continue and they saw the Oswalds occasionally until the spring of
1963.255
</p> <p>Shortly after his return from the Soviet Union, Oswald severed all
relations with his mother; he did not see his brother Robert from
Thanksgiving of 1962 until November 23, 1963.256 At the time of his
defection, Oswald had said that neither his brother, Robert, nor his
mother were objects of his affection, "but only examples of workers in
the U.S." He also indicated to officials at the American Embassy in
Moscow that his defection was motivated at least in part by so-called
exploitation of his mother by the capitalist system.257 Consistent
with this attitude he first told his wife that he did not have a
mother, but later admitted that he did but that "he didn't love her
very much." 258
</p> <p>When they arrived from the Soviet Union, Oswald and his family
lived at first with his brother Robert. The latter testified that they
"were just together again," as if his brother "had not been to
Russia." He also said that he and his family got along well with
Marina Oswald and enjoyed showing her American things.259 After about
a month with his brother, Oswald and his family lived for a brief
period with his mother at her urging, but Oswald soon decided
to move out.260
</p> <p><b>Page 402</b>
</p> <p>Marguerite Oswald visited her son and his family at the first
apartment which he rented after his return, and tried to help them get
settled there. After she had bought some clothes for Marina Oswald and
a highchair for the baby, Oswald emphatically told her to stop. As
Marguerite Oswald testified, "he strongly put me in my place about
buying things for his wife that he himself could not buy." 261 Oswald
objected to his mother visiting the apartment and became quite
incensed with his wife when she would open the door for her in spite
of his instructions to the contrary.262 Oswald moved to Dallas on
about October 8, 1962, without telling his mother where he was going.
He never saw or communicated with her in any way again until she came
to see him after the assassination.263
</p> <p>Even though Oswald cut off relations with his mother, he attempted
for the first time to learn something about his family background when
he went to New Orleans in April of 1963. He visited some of his
father's elderly relatives and the cemetery where his father was
buried in an effort to develop the facts of his genealogy.264 While it
does not appear that he established any new relationships as a result
of his investigation, he did obtain a large picture of his father from
one of the elderly relatives with whom he spoke.265 Oswald's interest
in such things presents a sharp contrast with his attitude at the time
of his defection, when he evidenced no interest in his father and
hardly mentioned him, even when questioned.266
</p> <p><a href="chapter-7.html#top" name="employment">Return to Top</a></p> <p>
<b>Employment</b>
</p> <p>Oswald's defection, his interest in the Soviet Union, and his
activities on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee not only
caused him difficulties in his employment relations, but they also
provided him with excuses for employment failures which were largely
of his own making. Oswald experienced some difficulty finding
employment. Perhaps this was partially because of his lack of any
specific skill or training.267 Some of his acquaintances, feeling that
Oswald tried to impress people with the fact that he had lived and
worked in Russia, were led to the belief that his employment
difficulties were caused by his telling prospective employers that he
had last been employed in Minsk.268 While he might have expected
difficulty from such an approach, in fact the evidence indicates that
Oswald usually told his prospective employers and employment
counselors that he had recently been discharged from the Marine
Corps.269
</p> <p>Oswald obtained a job in July of 1962 as a sheet metal worker with
a company in Fort Worth. His performance for that company was
satisfactory.270 Even though he told his wife that he had been fired,
he voluntarily left on October 8, 1962, and moved to Dallas.271
</p> <p>On October 9, 1962 he went to the Dallas office of the Texas
Employment Commission where he expressed a reluctance to work in the
industrial field.272 He indicated an interest in writing. An
employment counselor testified, on the basis of a general aptitude
test Oswald had taken, that he had some aptitude in that area,
"because the verbal score
</p> <p><b>Page 403</b>
</p> <p>is high and the clerical score is high." 273 While that counselor
found that he was qualified to handle many different types of jobs,
because of his need for immediate employment she attempted to obtain
for him any job that was available at the time. Oswald made qualifying
marks in 19 of 23 categories included on the general aptitude
examination and scored 127 on the verbal test, as compared with 50
percent of the people taking it who score less than 100. The counselor
testified that there was some indication that Oswald was capable of
doing college work and noted that Oswald's verbal and clerical
potential was "outstanding." 274 Employment Commission records
concerning Oswald stated: "Well-groomed &amp; spoken, business suit,
alert replies--Expresses self extremely well." 275 Oswald said that he
hoped eventually to develop qualifications for employment as a junior
executive through a work-study program at a local college. He
indicated, however, that he would have to delay that program because
of his immediate financial needs and responsibilities.276
</p> <p>On October 11, 1962, the Employment Commission referred Oswald to
a commercial advertising photography firm in Dallas,277 where he was
employed as a trainee starting October 12, 1962.278 Even though Oswald
indicated that he liked photographic work,279 his employer found that
he was not an efficient worker. He was not able to produce
photographic work which adhered with sufficient precision to the job
specifications and as a result too much of his work had to be
redone.280 He also had difficulty in working with the other employees.
This was at least in part because of the close physical confines in
which some of the work had to be done.281 He did not seem to be able
to make the accommodations necessary when people work under such
conditions and as a result became involved in conflicts, some of which
were fairly heated, with his fellow employees.282
</p> <p>In February or March of 1963, it began to appear that Oswald was
having  considerable difficulty doing accurate work and in getting
along with the other employees. It appears that his discharge was
hastened by the fact that he brought a Russian language newspaper to
work.283 It is not possible to tell whether Oswald did this to provide 
an excuse for his eventual discharge, or whether he brought the
Russian language newspaper with him one day after his other
difficulties became clear. It is possible that his immediate
supervisor noticed the newspaper at that time because his attention
had otherwise been drawn more directly to Oswald. In any event, Oswald
was discharged on April 6, 1963, ostensibly because of his
inefficiency and difficult personality. His supervisor admitted,
however, that while he did not fire Oswald because of the newspaper
incident or even weigh it heavily in his decision, "it didn't do his
case any good." 284
</p> <p>Upon moving to New Orleans on April 24, 1963, Oswald's
employment problems became more difficult. He left his wife and
child at the home of a friend, Mrs. Ruth Paine, of Irving, Tex.285 In
New Orleans he obtained work as a greaser and oiler of coffee
processing machines for the William B. Reily Co., beginning May 10,
1963.286
</p> <p><b>Page 404</b>
</p> <p>After securing this job and an apartment, Oswald asked his wife to
join him. Mrs. Paine brought Oswald's family to New Orleans.287
Refusing to admit that he could only get work as a greaser, Oswald
told his wife and Mrs. Paine that he was working as a commercial
photographer.288 He lost his job on July 19, 1963, because his work
was not satisfactory 289 and because he spent too much time loitering
in the garage next door, where he read rifle and hunting magazines.290
Oswald apparently concluded that his Fair Play for Cuba Committee
activities were not related to his discharge.291 The correct-ness of
that conclusion is supported by the fact that he does not seem to have
been publicly identified with that organization until August 9, 1963,
almost a month after he lost his job.292
</p> <p>His Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities, however, made it more
difficult for him to obtain other employment. A placement interviewer
of the Louisiana Department of Labor who had previously interviewed
Oswald, saw him on television and heard a radio debate in which he
engaged on August 21, 1963. He consulted with his supervisor and "it
was determined that we should not undertake to furnish employment
references for him." 293 Ironically, he failed to get a job in another
photographic firm after his return to Dallas in October of 1963,
because the president of the photographic firm for which he had
previously worked told the prospective employer that Oswald was "kinda
peculiar sometimes and that he had some knowledge of the Russian
language," and that he "may be a damn Communist. I can't tell you. If
I was you, I wouldn't hire him." 294 The plant superintendent of the
new firm testified that, one of the employees of the old firm "implied
that Oswald's fellow employees did not like him because he was
propagandizing and had been seen reading a foreign newspaper." As a
result Oswald was not hired.295 He subsequently found a job with the
Texas School Book Depository for which he performed his duties
satisfactorily.296
</p> <p><a href="chapter-7.html#top" name="attack">Return to Top</a></p> <p>
<b>Attack on General Walker</b>
</p> <p>The Commission has concluded that on April 10, 1963, Oswald shot
at Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker (Resigned, U.S. Army), demonstrating once
again his propensity to act dramatically and, in this instance
violently, in furtherance of his beliefs. The shooting occurred 2
weeks before Oswald moved to New Orleans and a few days after he had
been discharged by the photographic firm. As indicated in chapter IV,
Oswald had been planning his attack on General Walker for at least
1297 and perhaps as much as 2 months.298 He outlined his plans in a
notebook and studied them at considerable length before his attack.299
He also studied Dallas bus schedules to prepare for his later use of
buses to travel to and from General Walker's house.300 Sometime after
March 27, but according to Marina Oswald, prior to April 10, 1963,301
Oswald posed for two pictures with his recently acquired rifle and
pistol, a copy of the March 24, 1963, issue of the Worker, and the
March 11, 1963, issue of the
</p> <p><b>Page 405</b>
</p> <p>Militant.302 He told his wife that he wanted to send the pictures to
the Militant and he also asked her to keep one of the pictures for his
daughter, June.303
</p> <p>Following his unsuccessful attack on Walker, Oswald returned home.
He had left a note for his wife telling her what to do in case he were
apprehended, as well as his notebook and the pictures of himself
holding the rifle.304 She testified that she was agitated because she
had found the note in Oswald's room, where she had gone, contrary to
his instructions, after she became, worried about his absence.305 She
indicated that she had no advance knowledge of Oswald's plans, that
she became quite angry when Oswald told her what he had done, and that
she made him promise never to repeat such a performance. She said that
she kept the note to use against him "if something like that should be
repeated again." 306 When asked if Oswald requested the note back she
testified that:</p>
    <blockquote>He forgot about it. But apparently after he thought that what he had
written in his book might be proof against him, and he destroyed it.
[the book] 307</blockquote>
<p>
She later gave the following testimony [*indicates that the
witness answered without using the interpreter]:</p>
    <ul><li>Q.  After he brought the rifle home, then, he showed you the
book?</li>
	    <li>*A.  Yes.</li>
        <li>Q.  And you said it was not a good idea to keep this book ? </li>
	    <li>*A.  Yes.</li>
        <li>Q.  And then he burned the book?</li>
        <li>*A.  Yes.</li>
        <li>Q. Did you ask him why he had not destroyed the book before
he actually went to shoot General Walker?</li>
        <li>A. It never came to me, myself, to ask him that question.308</li>
		</ul><p>
Marina Oswald's testimony indicates that her husband was not
particularly concerned about his continued possession of the most
incriminating sort of evidence.309 If he had been successful and had
been apprehended even for routine questioning, his apartment would
undoubtedly have been searched, and his role would have been made
clear by the evidence which he had left behind. Leaving the note and
picture as he did would seem to indicate that he had considered the
possibility of capture. Possibly he might have wanted to be caught,
and wanted his involvement made clear if he was in fact apprehended.
Even after his wife told him to destroy the notebook he removed at
least some of the pictures which had been pasted in it and saved them
among his effects, where they were found after the assassination.310
His behavior was entirely consistent with his wife's testimony that:
</p> <p><b>Page 406</b></p>
	<blockquote>I asked him what for he was making all these entries in the book
and he answered that he wanted to leave a complete record so that all
the details would be in it.<br>
	I am guessing that perhaps he did it to appear to be a brave man
in case he were arrested, but that is my supposition. ... 311</blockquote>
<p>
The attempt on General Walker's life deserves close attention in
any consideration of Oswald's possible motive for the assassination
and the trail of evidence he left behind him on that occasion. While
there are differences between the two events as far as Oswald's
actions and planning are concerned, there are also similarities that
should be considered. The items which Oswald left at home when he made
his attack on Walker suggest a strong concern for his place in
history. If the attack had succeeded and Oswald had been caught, the
pictures showing him with his rifle and his Communist and Socialist
Worker's Party newspapers would probably have appeared on the front
pages of newspapers or magazines all over the country, as, in fact,
one of them did appear after the assassination.312 The circumstances
of the attack on Walker coupled with other indications that Oswald was
concerned about his place in history 313 and with the circumstances
surrounding the assassination, have led the Commission to believe that
such concern is an important factor to consider in assessing possible
motivation for the assassination.
</p> <p>In any event, the Walker incident indicates that in spite of the
belief among those who knew him that he was apparently not
dangerous,314 Oswald did not lack the determination and other traits
required to carry out a carefully planned killing of another human
being and was willing to consummate such a purpose if he thought there
was sufficient reason to do so. Some idea of what he thought was
sufficient reason for such an act may be found in the nature of the
motive that he stated for his attack on General Walker. Marina Oswald
indicated that her husband had compared General Walker to Adolph
Hitler. She testified that Oswald said that General Walker "was a very
bad man, that he was a fascist, that he was the leader of a fascist
organization, and when I said that even though all of that might be
true, just the same he had no right to take his life, he said if
someone had killed Hitler in time it would have saved many lives." 315
</p> <p><a href="chapter-7.html#top" name="political">Return to Top</a></p> <p>
<b>Political Activities</b>
</p> <p>Oswald's political activities after his return to the United
States center around his interest in Cuba and in the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee. Although, as indicated above, the Commission has been
unable to find any credible evidence that he was involved in any
conspiracy, his political activities do provide insight into certain
aspects of Oswald's character and into his possible motivation for the
assassination. While it appears that he may have distributed
</p> <p><b>Page 407</b>
</p> <p>Fair Play for Cuba Committee materials on one uneventful occasion in
Dallas sometime during the period April 6-24, 1963,316 Oswald's first
public identification with that cause was in New Orleans. There, in
late May and early June of 1963, under the name Lee Osborne, he had
printed a handbill headed in large letters "Hands Off Cuba," an
application form for, and a membership card in, the New Orleans branch
of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.317 He first distributed his
handbills and other material uneventfully in the vicinity of the
U.S.S. Wasp, which was berthed at the Dumaine Street wharf in New
Orleans, on June 16, 1963.318 He distributed literature in downtown

New Orleans on August 9, 1963, and was arrested because of a dispute
with three anti-Castro Cuban exiles, and again on August 16, 1963.319
Following his arrest, he was interviewed by the police, and at his own
request, by an agent of the FBI.320 On August 17, 1963, he appeared
briefly on a radio program a and on August 21, 1963, he debated over
radio station WDSU, New Orleans, with Carlos Bringuier, one of the
Cuban exiles who bad been arrested with him on August 9.322 Bringuier
claimed that on August 5, 1963, Oswald had attempted to infiltrate an
anti-Castro organization with which he was associated.323
</p> <p>While Oswald publicly engaged in the activities described above,
his "organization" was a product of his imagination.324 The imaginary
president of the nonexistent chapter was named A. J. Hidell,325 the
name that Oswald used when he purchased the assassination weapon.326
Marina Oswald said she signed that name, apparently chosen because it
rhymed with "Fidel," 327 to her husband's membership card in the New
Orleans chapter. She testified that he threatened to beat her if she
did not do so.328 The chapter had never been chartered by the national
FPCC organization.329 It appears to have been a solitary operation on
Oswald's part in spite of his misstatements to the New Orleans police
that it had 35 members, 5 of which were usually present at meetings
which were held once a month.330
</p> <p>Oswald's Fair Play for Cuba activities may be viewed as a very
shrewd political operation in which one man single handedly created
publicity for his cause or for himself. It is also evidence of
Oswald's reluctance to describe events accurately and of his need to
present himself to others as well as to himself in a light more
favorable than was justified by reality. This is suggested by his
misleading and sometime untruthful statements in his letters to Mr. V.
T. Lee, then national director of FPCC. In one of those letters, dated
August 1. 1963, Oswald wrote that an office which he had previously
claimed to have rented for FPCC activities had been "promply closed 3
days later for some obsure reasons by the renters, they said something
about remodeling ect., I'm sure you understand." 331 He wrote that
"thousands of circulars were distrubed" 332 and that he continued to
receive inquiries through his post office box which he endeavored "to
keep ansewering to the best of my ability." 333 In his letter to V. T.
Lee, he stated that he was then alone in his efforts on behalf of
FPCC, but he attributed his lack of support to an attack by Cuban
</p> <p><b>Page 408</b>
</p> <p>exiles in a street demonstration and being "officialy cautioned" by
the police, events which "robbed me of what support I had leaving me
alone." 334
</p> <p>In spite of those claims, the Commission has not been able to
uncover any evidence that anyone ever attacked any street
demonstration in which Oswald was involved, except for the Bringuier
incident mentioned above, which occurred 8 days after Oswald wrote the
above letter to V. T. Lee.335 Bringuier, who seemed to be familiar
with many anti-Castro activities in New Orleans, was not aware of any
such incident.336 Police reports also fail to reflect any activity on
Oswald's part prior to August 9, 1963, except for the uneventful
distribution of literature at the Dumaine Street wharf in June.337
Furthermore, the general tenor of Oswald's next letter to V. T. Lee,
in which he supported his report on the Bringuier incident with a copy
of the charges made against him and a newspaper clipping reporting the
event, suggests that his previous story of an attack by Cuban exiles
was at least greatly exaggerated.338 While the legend "FPCC 544 Camp
St. NEW ORLEANS, LA." was stamped on some literature that Oswald had
in his possession at the time of his arrest in New Orleans, extensive
investigation was not able to connect Oswald with that address,
although it did develop the fact that an anti-Castro organization had
maintained offices there for a period ending early in 1962.339 The
Commission has not been able to find any other indication that Oswald
had rented an office in New Orleans. In view of the limited amount of
public activity on Oswald's part before August 9, 1963, there also
seems to be no basis for his claim that he had distributed "thousands"
of circulars, especially since he had claimed to have printed only
2,000 and actually had only 1,000 printed. In addition, there is no
evidence that he received any substantial amount of materials from the
national headquarters.340
</p> <p>In another letter to V. T. Lee, dated August 17, 1963, Oswald
wrote that he had appeared on Mr. William Stuckey's 15-minute
television program over WDSU-TV called "Latin American Focus" as a
result of which he was "flooded with callers and invitations to
debate's ect. as well as people interested in joining the F.P.C.C. New
Orleans branch." 341 WDSU has no program of any kind called "Latin
American Focus." 342 Stuckey had a radio program called "Latin
Listening Post," on which Oswald was heard for less than 5 minutes on
August 17, 1963.343 It appears that Oswald had only one caller in
response to all of his FPCC activities, an agent of Bringuier's
attempting to learn more about the true nature of the alleged FPCC
"organization" in New Orleans.344
</p> <p>Oswald's statements suggest that he hoped to be flooded with
callers and invitations to debate. This would have made him a real
center of attention as he must have been when he first arrived in the
Soviet Union and as he was to some extent when he returned to the
United States. The limited notoriety that Oswald received as a result
of the street fracas and in the subsequent radio debate was apparently
not enough to satisfy him. He exaggerated in his letters to V. T. Lee
in an appar-

</p> <p>ent attempt to make himself and his activities appear far more
important than they really were.
</p> <p>His attempt to express himself through his Fair Play for Cuba
activities, however, was greatly impeded by the fact that the radio
debate over WDSU on August 21, 1963, brought out the history of his
defection to the Soviet Union.345 The basic facts of the event were
uncovered independently by William Stuckey, who arranged the debate,
and Edward Butler, executive director of the Information Council of
the Americas, who also appeared on the program.346 Oswald was
confronted with those facts at the beginning of the debate and was so
thrown on the defensive by this that he was forced to state that Fair
Play for Cuba was "not at all Communist controlled regardless of the
fact that I had the experience of living in Russia."
</p> <p>Stuckey testified that uncovering Oswald's defection was very
important:</p>
    <blockquote>I think that we finished him on that program. ... because we had
publicly linked the Fair Play for Cuba Committee with a fellow who had
lived in Russia for 3 years and who was an admitted Marxist.<br>
The interesting thing, or rather the danger involved, was the
fact that Oswald seemed like such a nice, bright boy and was extremely
believable before this. We thought the fellow could probably get quite
a few members if he was really indeed serious about getting members.
We figured after this broadcast of August 21, why, that was no longer
possible.348</blockquote>
<p>
In spite of the fact that Oswald had been surprised and was on
the defensive throughout the debate, according to Stuckey: "Mr. Oswald
handled himself very well, as usual." 349 Stuckey thought Oswald
"appeared to be a very logical,  intelligent fellow," and "was
arrested by his cleancutness." 350 He did not think Oswald looked like
the "type" that he would have expected to find associating with a
group such as the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.351 Stuckey thought
that Oswald acted very much as would a young attorney.352
</p> <p>Following the disclosure of his defection, Oswald sought advice
from the Communist Party, U.S.A., concerning his Fair Play for Cuba
activity.358 He had previously sent, apparently unsolicited, to the
Party newspaper, the Worker, samples of his photographic work,
offering to contribute that sort of service without charge.354 The
Worker replied: "Your kind offer is most welcomed and from time to
time we shall call on you." 355 He later wrote to another official of
the Worker, seeking employment, and mentioning the praise he had
received for submitting his photographic work.356 He presented Arnold
Johnson, Gus Hall, and Benjamin J. Davis honorary membership cards in
his nonexistent New Orleans chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee, and advised them of some of his activities on behalf of the
organization.357 Arnold Johnson, director of the in-
</p> <p><b>Page 411</b>
</p> <p>formation and lecture bureau of the Communist Party, U.S.A., replied
stating:</p>
    <blockquote>It is good to know that movements in support of fair play for Cuba
has developed in New Orleans as well as in other cities. We do not
have any organizational ties with the Committee, and yet there is
much material that we issue from time to time that is important for
anybody who is concerned about developments in Cuba.358</blockquote>
<p>
Marina Oswald said that such correspondence from people he considered
important meant much to Oswald. After he had begun his Cuban activity
in New Orleans "he received a letter from somebody in New York, some
Communist--probably from New York--I am not sure from where--from some
Communist leader and he was very happy, he felt that this was a great
man that he had received the letter from." 359 Since he seemed to feel
that no one else understood his political views, the letter was of
great value to him for it "was proof ... that there were people who'
understood his activity." 360
</p> <p>He anticipated that the full disclosure of his defection would
hinder him in "the struggle for progress and freedom in the United
States" 361 into which Oswald, in his own words, had "thrown" himself.
He sought advice from the central committee of the Communist Party,
U.S.A., in a letter dated August 28, 1963, about whether he could
"continue to fight, handicapped as it were, by my past record ...
[and] compete with anti-progressive forces, above-ground or weather in
your opinion I should always remain in the background, i.e.
underground." 362 Stating that he had used his "position" with what he
claimed to be the local branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee to
"foster communist ideals," Oswald wrote that he felt that he might
have compromised the FPCC and expressed concern lest "Our opponents
could use my background of residence in the U.S.S.R. against any cause
which I join, by association, they could say the organization of which
I am a member, is Russian controled, ect." 363 In reply Arnold Johnson
advised Oswald that, while as an American citizen he had a right to
participate in such organizations as he wished, "there are a number of
organizations, including possibly Fair Play, which are of a very broad
character, and often it is advisable for some people to remain in the
background, not underground." 364
</p> <p>By August of 1963, after a short 3 months in New Orleans, the city
in which he had been born and had lived most of his early life, Oswald
had fallen on difficult times. He had not liked his job as a greaser
of coffee processing machinery and he held it for only a little over 2
months.365 He had not found another job. His wife was expecting their
second child in October and there was concern about the cost which
would be involved.366 His brief foray on behalf of the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee had failed to win any support. While he had drawn some
attention to himself and had actually
</p> <p><b>Page 412</b>
</p> <p>appeared on two radio programs, he had been attacked by Cuban exiles
and arrested, an event which his wife thought upset him and as a
result of which "he became less active, he cooled off a little." 367
More seriously, the facts of his defection had become known, leaving
him open to almost unanswerable attack by those who opposed his views.
It would not have been possible to have followed Arnold Johnson's
advice to remain in the background, since there was no background to
the New Orleans FPCC "organization," which consisted solely of Oswald.
Furthermore, he had apparently not received any letters from the
national headquarters of FPCC since May 29, 1963,368 even though he
had written four detailed letters since that time to Mr. V. T. Lee 369
and had also kept the national headquarters informed of each of his
changes of mailing address.370 Those events no doubt had their effects
on Oswald.
</p> <p><a href="chapter-7.html#top" name="cuba">Return to Top</a></p> <p>
<b>Interest in Cuba</b>
</p> <p>By August of 1963, Oswald had for some time been considering the
possibility of leaving the United States again. On June 24, 1963, he
applied for a new passport 371 and in late June or early July he told
his wife that he wanted to return to the Soviet Union with her. She
said that he was extremely upset, very unhappy, and that he actually
wept when he told her that.372 He said that nothing kept him in the
United States, that he would not lose anything if he returned to the
Soviet Union, that he wanted to be with her and that it would be
better to have less and not have to be concerned about tomorrow.373
</p> <p>As a result of that conversation, Marina Oswald wrote the Soviet
Embassy in Washington concerning a request she had first made on
February 17, 1963, for permission for herself and June to return to
the Soviet Union.374 While that first request, made according to
Marina Oswald at her husband's insistence, specifically stated that
Oswald was to remain in the United States, she wrote in her letter of
July 1963, that things are improving due to the fact that my husband
expresses a sincere wish to return together with me to the USSR." 375
Unknown to his wife, however, Oswald apparently enclosed a note with
her letter of July in which he requested the Embassy to rush his
wife's entrance visa because of the impending birth of the second
child but stated that: "As for my return entrance visa please consider
it separtably."  376
</p> <p>Thus while Oswald's real intentions, assuming that they were known
to himself, are not clear, he may not have intended to go to the
Soviet Union directly, if at all.377 It appears that he really wanted
to go to Cuba. In his wife's words:</p>
    <blockquote>I only know that his basic desire was to get to Cuba by any means, and
that all the rest of it was window dressing for that purpose.378</blockquote>

<p><b>Page 413</b>
</p> <p>Marina Oswald testified that her husband engaged in Fair Play for Cuba
Committee activities "primarily for purposes of self-advertising. He
wanted to be arrested. I think he wanted to get into the newspapers,
so that he would be known." 379 According to Marina Oswald, he thought
that would help him when he got to Cuba.380 He asked his wife to help
him to hijack an airplane to get there, but gave up that scheme when
she refused.381
</p> <p>During this period Oswald may have practiced opening and closing
the bolt on his rifle in a screened porch in his apartment.382 In
September he began to review Spanish.333 He approved arrangements for
his family to return to Irving, Tex., to live with Mrs. Ruth Paine.384
On September 20, 1963, Mrs. Paine and her two children arrived in New
Orleans from a trip to the East Coast 385 and left for Irving with
Marina Oswald and June and most of the Oswalds' effects 3 days
later.386 While Marina Oswald knew of her husband's plan to go to
Mexico and thence to Cuba if possible,387 Mrs. Paine was told that
Oswald was going to Houston and possibly to Philadelphia to look for
work.388
</p> <p>Oswald left for Mexico City on September 25, 1963, and arrived on
September 27, 1963. He went almost directly to the Cuban Embassy and
applied for a visa to Cuba in transit to Russia.389 Representing
himself as the head of the New Orleans branch of the "organization
called 'Fair Play for Cuba,' he stated his desire that he should be
accepted as a 'friend' of the Cuban Revolution." 390 He apparently
based his claim for a visa in transit to Russia on his previous
residence, his work permit for that country, and several unidentified
letters in the Russian language. The Cubans would not, however, give
him a visa until he had received one from the Soviets, which involved
a delay of several months. When faced with that situation Oswald
became greatly agitated, and although he later unsuccessfully
attempted to obtain a Soviet visa at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City, he insisted that he was entitled to the Cuban visa because of
his background, partisanship, and personal activities on behalf of the
Cuban movement. He engaged in an angry argument with the consul who
finally told him that "as far as he was concerned he would not give
him a visa" and that "a person like him [Oswald] in place of aiding
the Cuban Revolution, was doing it harm." 391</p>

<p>Oswald must have been thoroughly disillusioned when he left Mexico
City on October 2, 1963. In spite of his former residence in the
Soviet Union and his Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities he had
been rebuffed by the officials of both Cuba and the Soviet Union it.
Mexico City. Now there appeared to be no chance to get to Cuba, where
he had thought he might find his communist ideal. The U.S. Government
would not permit travel there and as far as the perform- ante of the
Cubans themselves was concerned, he was "disappointed at not being
able to get to Cuba, and he didn't have any great desire to do so any
more because he had run into, as he himself said--into bureaucracy and
red tape." 392
</p>
<p> 
<b>Page 414</b>
</p> <p>Oswald's attempt to go to Cuba was another act which expressed his
hostility toward the United States and its institutions as well as a
concomitant attachment to a country in which he must have thought were
embodied the political principles to which he had been committed for
so long. It should be noted that his interest in Cuba seems to have
increased along with the sense of frustration which must have
developed as he experienced successive failures in his jobs, in his
political activity, and in his personal relationships. In retrospect
his attempt to go to Cuba or return to the Soviet Union may well have
been Oswald's last escape hatch, his last gambit to extricate himself
from the mediocrity and defeat which plagued him throughout most of
his life.
</p> <p>Oswald's activities with regard to Cuba raise serious questions as
to how much he might have been motivated in the assassination by a
desire to aid the Castro regime, which President Kennedy so
out-spokenly criticized. For example, the Dallas Times Herald of
November 19, 1963, prominently reported President Kennedy as having
"all but invited the Cuban people today to overthrow Fidel Castro's
Communist regime and promised prompt U.S. aid if they do." 393 The
Castro regime severely attacked President Kennedy in connection with
the Bay of Pigs affair, the Cuban missile crisis, the ban on travel to
Cuba, the economic embargo against that country, and the general
policy of the United States with regard to Cuba. An examination of the
Militant, to which Oswald subscribed,394 for the 3-month period prior
to the assassination reflects an extremely critical attitude toward
President Kennedy and his administration concerning Cuban policy in
general as well as on the issues of automation and civil rights,
issues which appeared to concern Oswald a great deal.395 The Militant
also reflected a critical attitude toward President Kennedy's attempts
to reduce tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. It
also dealt with the fear of the Castro regime that such a policy might
result in its abandonment by the Soviet Union.
</p>
<p>The October 7, 1963, issue of the Militant reported Castro as
saying Cuba could not accept a situation where at the same time the
United States was trying to ease world tensions it also. "was
increasing its efforts to 'tighten the noose' around Cuba." 396
Castro's opposition to President Kennedy's attempt to reduce world
tensions was also reported in the October 1, 1963, issue of the
Worker, to which Oswald also subscribed.397 In this connection it
should be noted that in speaking of the Worker, Oswald told Michael
Paine, apparently in all seriousness, that "you could tell what they
wanted you to do ... by reading between the lines, reading the thing
and doing a little reading between the lines.." 398
</p>
<p>The general conflict of views between the United States and Cuba
was, of course, reflected in other media to such an extent that there
can be no doubt that Oswald was aware generally of the critical
attitude that Castro expressed about President Kennedy. Oswald was
asked during the New Orleans radio debate in which he engaged on
August 21, 1963, whether or not he agreed with Castro that President
</p>
<p><b>Page 415</b>
</p> <p>Kennedy was a "ruffian and a thief." He replied that he "would not
agree with that particular wording." 399 It should also be noted,
however, that one witness testified that shortly before the
assassination Oswald had expressed approval of President Kennedy's
active role in the area of civil rights.400
</p> <p>Although Oswald could possibly have been motivated in part by his
sympathy for the Castro government, it should be remembered that his
wife testified that he was disappointed with his failure to get to
Cuba and had lost his desire to do so because of the bureaucracy and
red tape which he had encountered.401 His unhappy experience with the
Cuban consul seems thus to have reduced his enthusiasm for the Castro
regime and his desire to go to Cuba.
</p> <p>While some of Castro's more severe criticisms of President Kennedy
might have led Oswald to believe that he would be well received in
Cuba after he had assassinated the American President, it does not
appear that he had any plans to go there. Oswald was carrying only
$13.87 at the time of his arrest, although he had left, apparently by
design, $170 in a wallet in his wife's room in Irving.402 If there was
no conspiracy which would help him escape, the possibility of which
has been considered in chapter VI, it is unlikely that a reasoning
person would plan to attempt to travel from Dallas, Tex., to Cuba with
$13.87 when considerably greater resources were available to him. The
fact that Oswald left behind the funds which might have enabled him to
reach Cuba suggests the absence of any plan to try to flee there and
raises serious questions as to whether or not he ever expected to
escape.
</p> <p><a href="chapter-7.html#top" name="possible">Return to Top</a></p> <p>
<b>Possible Influence of Anti-Kennedy Sentiment in Dallas</b>
</p> <p>It has been suggested that one of the motivating influences
operating on Lee Oswald was the atmosphere in the city of Dallas,
especially an atmosphere of extreme opposition to President Kennedy
that was present in some parts of the Dallas community and which
received publicity there prior to the assassination.403 Some of that
feeling was expressed in the incident involving then vice-presidential
candidate Johnson during the 1960 campaign, in the treatment of
Ambassador Adlai Stevenson late in October of 1963 and in the extreme
anti-Kennedy newspaper advertisement and handbills that appeared in
Dallas at the time of the President's visit there.404
</p> <p>The Commission has found no evidence that the extreme views
expressed toward President Kennedy by some rightwing groups centered
in Dallas or any other general atmosphere of hate or rightwing
extremism which may have existed in the city of Dallas had any
connection with Oswald's actions on November 22, 1963. There is, of
course, no way to judge what the effect of the general political
ferment present in that city might have been, even though Oswald was
aware of it. His awareness is shown by a letter that he wrote to
Arnold Johnson of the Communist Party U.S.A., which Johnson said he
did not receive until after the assassination. The letter said in
part:
</p> <p><b>Page 416</b></p>
   <blockquote>On October 23rd, I had attened a ultra-right meeting headed by
General Edwin A. Walker, who lives in Dallas.<br>
	This meeting preceded by one day the attack on A. E. Stevenson at
the United Nations Day meeting at which he spoke<br>
	As you can see, political friction between "left" and "right" is
very great here.<br>
	Could you advise me as to the general view we have on the American
Civil Liberties Union? 405</blockquote>
<p>
In any event, the Commission has been unable to find any credible
evidence that Oswald had direct contact or association with any of the
personalities or groups epitomizing or representing the so-called
rightwing, even though he did, as he told Johnson, attend a meeting at
which General Walker spoke to approximately 1,300 persons.406 Oswald's
writings and his reading habits indicate that he had an extreme
dislike of the rightwing, an attitude most clearly reflected by his
attempt to shoot General Walker.

<b>Relationship With Wife</b>
</p> <p>The relations between Lee and Marina Oswald are of great
importance in any attempt to understand Oswald's possible motivation.
During the period from Oswald's return from Mexico to the
assassination, he and his wife spent every weekend but one together at
the Irving, Tex., home of Mrs. Ruth Paine, who was then separated from
her husband. The sole exception was the weekend of November 16-17,
1963, the weekend before the assassination, when his wife asked Oswald
not to come to Irving. During the week, Oswald lived in a roominghouse
in Dallas, but he usually called his wife on the telephone twice a
day.407 She testified that after his return from Mexico Oswald
"changed for the better. He began to treat me better. ... He helped
me more--although he always did help. But he was more attentive." 408
Marina Oswald attributed that to their living apart and to the
imminent birth of their second child. She testified that Oswald "was
very happy" about the birth of the child.409
</p> <p>While those considerations no doubt had an effect on Oswald's
attitude toward his family it would seem that the need for support and
sympathy after his recent rebuffs in Mexico City might also have been
important to him. It would not have been the first time that Oswald
sought closer ties with his family in time of adversity.410
</p> <p>His past relationships with his wife had been stormy, however, and
it did not seem that she respected him very much. They had been
married after a courtship of only about 6 weeks, a part of which
Oswald spent in the hospital. Oswald's diary reports that he married
his wife shortly after his proposal of marriage to another girl had
been rejected. He stated that the other girl rejected him partly
because he was an American, a fact that he said she had exploited. He
stated that "In spite of fact I married Marina to hurt Ella [the girl
that had rejected him] I found myself in love with Marina." 411
</p> <p><b>Page 417</b>
</p> <p>Many of the people with whom the Oswalds became acquainted after their
arrival in the United States thought that Marina Oswald had married
her husband primarily in the hope that she would be able to leave the
Soviet Union. Marina Oswald has denied this.412
</p> <p>Marina Oswald expressed one aspect of her husband's attitude
toward her when she testified that:</p>
    <blockquote>... Lee wanted me to go to Russia, and I told him that if he
wanted me to go then that meant that he didn't love me, and that in
that case what was the idea of coming to the United States in the
first place. Lee would say that it would be better for me if I went to
Russia. I did not. know why. I did not know what he had in mind. He
said he loved me but that it would be better for me if I went to
Russia, and what he had in mind I don't know.413</blockquote>
<p>
On the other hand, Oswald objected to the invitation that his wife had
received to live with Mrs. Ruth Paine, which Mrs. Paine had made in
part to give her an alternative to returning to the Soviet Union.414
Marina Oswald wrote to Mrs. Paine that: "Many times</p>
    <blockquote>[Oswald] has recalled this matter to me and said that I am just
waiting for an opportunity to hurt him. It has been the cause of many
of our arguments." 415 Oswald claimed that his wife preferred others
to him.416 He said this about members of the Russian-speaking group in
the Dallas-Ft. Worth area, whom she said he tried to forbid her from
seeing,417 and also about Mrs. Paine.418 He specifically made that
claim when his wife refused to come to live with him in Dallas as he
asked her to do on the evening of November 21, 1963.419</blockquote>
<p>
The instability of their relations was probably a function of the
personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with
his wife. He apparently attempted to be "the Commander" by dictating
many of the details of their married life.420 While Marina Oswald said
that her husband wanted her to learn English,421 he made no attempt to
help her and there are other indications that he did not want her to
learn that language. Oswald apparently wished to continue practicing
his own Russian with her.422 Lieutenant Martello of the New Orleans
police testified that Oswald stated that he did not speak English in
his family because he did not want them to become Americanized.423
Marina Oswald's inability to speak English also made it more
difficult, for her to have an independent existence in this country.
Oswald struck his wife on occasion,424 did not want her to drink,
smoke or wear cosmetics 425 and generally treated her with lack of
respect in the presence of others.426
</p> <p>The difficulties which Oswald's problems would have caused him in
any relationship were probably not reduced by his wife's conduct.
Katherine Ford, with whom Marina Oswald stayed during her separation
from her husband in November of 1962, thought that Marina Oswald was
immature in her thinking and partly responsible for the difficulties
that the Oswalds were having at that time.427 Mrs. Ford

</p> <p>said that Marina Oswald admitted that she provoked Oswald on
occasion.428 There can be little doubt that some provocation existed.
Oswald once struck his wife because of a letter which she wrote to a
former boy friend in Russia. In the letter Marina Oswald stated that
her husband had changed a great deal and that she was very lonely in
the United States. She was "sorry that I had not married him [the
Russian boy friend] instead, that it would have been much easier for
me." 429 The letter fell into Oswald's hands when it was returned to
his post office box because of insufficient postage, which apparently
resulted from an increase in postal rates of which his wife had been
unaware.430 Oswald read the letter, but refused to believe that it was
sincere, even though his wife insisted to him that it was. As a result
Oswald struck her, as to which she testified: "Generally, I think that
was right, for such things that is the right thing to do. There was
some grounds for it.431
</p> <p>Although she denied it in some of her testimony before the
Commission,432 it appears that Marina Oswald also complained that her
husband was not able to provide more material things for her.433 On
that issue George De Mohrenschildt, who was probably as close to the
Oswalds as anyone else during their first stay in Dallas, said that:</p>
    <blockquote>She was annoying him all the time--"Why don't you make some money?" ... Poor guy was going out of his mind. ...
	We told her she should not annoy him--poor guy, he is doing his
best, "Don't annoy him so much." 434</blockquote>
<p>
The De Mohrenschildts also testified that "right in front" of
Oswald Marina Oswald complained about Oswald's inadequacy as a
husband.435 Mrs. Oswald told another of her friends that Oswald was
very cold to her, that they very seldom had sexual relations and that
Oswald "was not a man." 436 She also told Mrs. Paine that she was not
satisfied with her sexual relations with Oswald.437
</p> <p>Marina Oswald also ridiculed her husband's political views,
thereby tearing down his view of his own importance. He was very much
interested in autobiographical works of outstanding statesmen of the
United States, to whom his wife thought he compared himself.438 She
said he was different from other people in "At, least his imagination,
his fantasy, which was quite unfounded, as to the fact that he was an
outstanding man." 439 She said that she "always tried to point out to
him that he was a man like any others who were around us. But he
simply could not understand that? 440 Jeanne De Mohrenschildt,
however, thought that Marina Oswald "said things that will hurt men's
pride." 441 She said that if she ever spoke to her husband the way
Marina Oswald spoke to her husband, "we would not last long." 442 Mrs.
De Mohrenschildt thought that Oswald, whom she compared to "a puppy
dog that everybody kicked," 443 had a lot of good qualities, in spite
of the fact that "Nobody said anything good about him." 444 She had
"the impression that he was just pushed, pushed, pushed, and she
[Marina Oswald] was probably nagging, nag-
</p> <p><b>Page 419</b>
</p> <p>ging, nagging." 445 She thought that he might not have become involved
in the assassination if people had been kinder to him.446
</p> <p>In spite of these difficulties, however, and in the face of the
economic problems that were always with them, things apparently went
quite smoothly from the time Oswald returned from Mexico until the
weekend of November 16-17, 1963.447 Mrs. Paine was planning a birthday
party for one of her children on that weekend and her husband,
Michael, was to be at the house. Marina Oswald said that she knew her
husband did not like Michael Paine and so she asked him not to come
out that weekend, even though he wanted to do so. She testified that
she told him "that he shouldn't come every week, that perhaps it is
not convenient for Ruth that the whole family be there, live there."
She testified that he responded: "As you wish. If you don't want me to
come, I won't." 448 Ruth Paine testified that she heard Marina Oswald
tell Oswald about the birthday party.449
</p> <p>On Sunday, November 17, 1963, Ruth Paine and Marina Oswald decided
to call Oswald 450 at the place where he was living, unbeknownst to
them, under the name of O. H. Lee.451 They asked for Lee Oswald who
was not called to the telephone because he was known by the other
name.452 When Oswald called the next day his wife became very angry
about his use of the alias.453 He said that he used it because "he did
not want his landlady to know his real name because she might read in
the paper of the fact that he had been in Russia and that he had been
questioned." 454 Oswald also said that he did not want the FBI to know
where he lived "Because their visits were not very pleasant for him
and he thought that he loses jobs because the FBI visits the place of
his employment." 455 While the facts of his defection had become known
in New Orleans as a result of his radio debate with Bringuier,456 it
would appear to be unlikely that his landlady in Dallas would see
anything in the newspaper about his defection, unless he engaged in
activities similar to those which had led to the disclosure of his
defection in New Orleans. Furthermore, even though it appears that at
times Oswald was really upset by visits of the FBI, it does not appear
that he ever lost his job because of its activities, although he may
well not have been aware of that fact.457
</p> <p>While Oswald's concern about the FBI had some basis in fact, in
that FBI agents had interviewed him in the past and had renewed their
interest to some extent after his Fair Play for Cuba Committee
activities had become known, he exaggerated their concern for him.
Marina Oswald thought he did so in order to emphasize his
importance.458 For example, in his letter of November 9, 1963, to the
Soviet Embassy in Washington, he asked about the entrance visas for
which he and his wife had previously applied. He absolved the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City of any blame for his difficulties there. He
advised the Washington Embassy that the FBI was "not now" interested
in his Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities, but noted that the FBI
"has visited us here in Dallas, Texas, on November 1. Agent James P.
Hasty warned me that if I engaged in F.P.C.C. activities in Texas
</p> <p><b>Page 420</b>
</p> <p>the F.B.I. will again take an 'interrest' in me." 459 Neither Hosty
nor any other agent of the FBI spoke to Oswald on any subject from
August 10, 1963, to the time of the assassination.460 The claimed
warning was one more of Oswald's fabrications. Hosty had come to the
Paine residence on November 1 and 5, 1963, but did not issue any such
warning or suggest that Marina Oswald defect from the Soviet Union and
remain in the United States under FBI protection, as Oswald went on to
say.461 In Oswald's imagination "I and my wife strongly protested
these tactics by the notorious F.B.I." 462 In fact, his wife testified
that she only said that she would prefer not to receive any more
visits from the Bureau because of the "very exciting and disturbing
effect" they had upon her husband,463 who was not even present at that
time.464
</p> <p>The arguments he used to justify his use of the alias suggest that
Oswald may have come to think that the whole world was becoming
involved in an increasingly complex conspiracy against him. He may
have felt he could never tell when the FBI was going to appear on the
scene or who else was going to find out about his defection and use it
against him as had been done in New Orleans.465 On the other hand, the
concern he expressed about the FBI may have been just another story to
support the objective he sought in his letter.
</p> <p>Those arguments, however, were not persuasive to Marina Oswald, to
whom "it was nothing terrible if people were to find out that he had
been in Russia." 466 She asked Oswald: "After all, when will all your
foolishness come to an end?  All of these comedies. First one thing
and then another. And now this fictitious name." 467 She said: "On
Monday [November 18, 1963] he called several times, but after I hung
up on him and didn't want to talk to him he did not call again. He
then arrived on Thursday [November 21, 1963]." 468
</p> <p>The events of that evening can best be appreciated through Marina
Oswald's testimony:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Q. Did your husband give any reason for coming home on Thursday?
    </p> <p>A. He said that he was lonely because he hadn't come the pre-
ceding weekend, and he wanted to make his peace with me. 
    </p> <p>Q. Did you say anything to him then?
    </p> <p>A. He tried to talk to me but I would not answer him, and he was
very upset. 
    </p> <p>Q. Were you upset with him?
    </p> <p>A. I was angry, of course. He was not angry--he was upset. I was
angry. He tried very hard to please me. He spent quite a bit of time
putting away diapers and played with the children on the street.
    </p> <p>Q. How did you indicate to him that you were angry with him? 
    
    </p> <p>A. By not talking to him.
    </p> <p>Q. And how did he show that he was upset?
    </p> <p>A. He was upset over the fact that I would not answer him. He
tried to start a conversation with me several times, but I</p></blockquote>
<b>Page 421</b>
    <blockquote><p>would not answer. And he said that he didn't want me to be angry at
him because this upsets him.
    </p> <p>On that day, he suggested that we rent an apartment in Dallas. He
said that he was tired of living alone and perhaps the reason for my
being so angry was the fact that we were not living together. That if
I want to he would rent an apartment in Dallas tomorrow--that he
didn't want me to remain with Ruth any longer, but wanted me to live
with him in Dallas.
    </p> <p>He repeated this not once but several times, but I refused. And he
said that once again I was preferring my friends to him, and that I
didn't need him.
    </p> <p>Q. What did you say to that?
    </p> <p>A. I said it would be better if I remained with Ruth until the
holidays, he would come, and we would all meet together. That this was
better because while he was living alone and I stayed with Ruth, we
were spending less money. And I told him to buy me a washing machine,
because two children it became too difficult to wash by hand.
    </p> <p>Q. What did he say to that?
    </p> <p>A. He said he would buy me a washing machine. 
    </p> <p>Q. What did you say to that?
    </p> <p>A. Thank you. That it would be better if he bought something for
himself--that I would manage.469</p></blockquote>
<p>
That night Oswald went to bed before his wife retired. She did not
speak to him when she joined him there, although she thought that he
was still awake. The next morning he left for work before anyone else
arose.470 For the first time he left his wedding ring in a cup on the
dresser in his room.471 He also left $170 in a wallet in one of the
dresser drawers. He took with him $13.87 472 and the long brown
package that Frazier and Mrs. Randle saw him carry and which he was to
take to the School Book Depository.473
</p>
<p> <b><a name="unanswered" id="unanswered"></a>The Unanswered Questions</b> </p>
<p>No one will ever know what passed through Oswald's mind during the
week before November 22, 1963. Instead of returning to Irving on
November 15 for his customary weekend visit, he remained in Dallas at
his wife's suggestion because of the birthday party. He had argued
with her over the use of an alias and had not called her after that
argument, although he usually telephoned once or twice a day. Then on
Thursday morning, November 21, he asked Frazier for a ride to Irving
that night, stating falsely that he wanted to pick up some curtain
rods to put in an apartment.474
</p> <p>He must have planned his attack at the very latest prior to
Thursday morning when he spoke to Frazier. There is, of course, no way
to determine the degree to which he was committed to his plan at that
time. While there is no way to tell when he first began to think
specifically of assassinating the President it should be noted that
mention of
</p> <p><b>Page 422</b>
</p> <p>the Trade Mart as the expected site of the Presidential luncheon
appeared in The Dallas Times Herald on November 15, 1963.475 The next
day that paper announced the final approval of the Trade Mart as the
luncheon site and stated that the motorcade "apparently will loop
through the downtown area, probably on Main Street, en route from
Dallas Love Field" on its way to the Trade Mart on Stemmons Freeway.
476  Anyone who was familiar with that area of Dallas would have known
that the motorcade would probably pass the Texas School Book
Depository to get from Main Street onto the Stemmons Freeway. That
fact was made precisely clear in subsequent news stories on November
19, 20, and 22. 477
</p> <p>On November 15, 1963, the same day that his wife told him not to
come to Irving, Oswald could have assumed that the Presidential
motorcade would pass in front of his place of work. Whether he thought
about assassinating the President over the weekend can never be known,
but it is reasonably certain that over the weekend he did think about
his wife's request that he not come to Irving, which was prompted by
the birthday party being held at the Paine home. Oswald had a highly
exaggerated sense of his own importance, but he had failed at almost
everything he had ever tried to do. He had great difficulty in
establishing meaningful relations with other people. Except for his
family he was completely alone. Even though he had searched--in the
Marine Corps, in his ideal of communism, in the Soviet Union and in
his attempt to get to Cuba--he had never found anything to which he
felt he could really belong.
</p> <p>After he returned from his trip to Mexico where his application to
go to Cuba had been sharply rejected, it must have appeared to him
that he was unable to command even the attention of his family. He
could not keep them with him in Dallas, where at least he could see
his children whom, several witnesses testified, he seemed to love.478
His family lived with Mrs. Paine, ostensibly because Oswald could not
afford to keep an apartment in Dallas, but it was also, at least in
part, because his wife did not want to live there with him.479 Now it
appeared that he was not welcome at the Paine home, where he had spent
every previous weekend since his return from Mexico and his wife was
once again calling into question his judgment, this time concerning
his use of an alias.
</p> <p>The conversation on Monday, November 18, 1963, ended when Marina
Oswald hung up and refused to talk to him. Although he may long before
have decided on the course he was to follow and may have told his wife
the things he did on the evening of November 21, 1963, merely to
disarm her and to provide a justification of sorts, both she and Mrs.
Paine thought he had come home to make up after the fight on Monday.
480 Thoughts of his personal difficulties must have been at least
partly on his mind when he went to Irving on Thursday night and told
his wife that he was lonely, that he wanted to make peace with her and
bring his family to Dallas where they could live with him again.
</p> <p><b>Page 423</b>
</p> <p>The Commission does not believe that the relations between Oswald
and his wife caused him to assassinate the President. It is unlikely
that the motivation was that simple. The feelings of hostility and
aggression which seem to have played such an important, part in
Oswald's life were part of his character long before he met his wife
and such a favorable opportunity to strike at a figure as great as the
President would probably never have come to him again.
</p> <p>Oswald's behavior after the assassination throws little light on
his motives. The fact that he took so little money with him when he
left Irving in the morning indicates that he did not expect to get
very far from Dallas on his own and suggests the possibility, as did
his note to his wife just prior to the attempt on General Walker,
that he did not expect to escape at all. On the other hand, he could
have traveled some distance with the money he did have and he did
return to his room where he obtained his revolver. He then killed
Patrolman Tippit when that police officer apparently tried to question
him after he had left his roominghouse and he vigorously resisted
arrest when he was finally apprehended in the Texas Theatre. Although
it is not fully corroborated by others who were present, two officers
have testified that at the time of his arrest Oswald said something to
the effect that "it's all over now." 481
</p> <p>Oswald was overbearing and arrogant throughout much of the time
between his arrest and his own death.482 He consistently refused to
admit involvement in the assassination or in the killing of Patrolman
Tippit.483  While he did become enraged at at least one point. in his
interrogation, the testimony of the officers present indicates that he
handled himself with considerable composure during his questioning. He
admitted nothing that would damage him but discussed other matters
quite freely. 484 His denials under questioning, which have no
probative value in view of the many readily demonstrable lies he told
at that time 485 and in the face of the overwhelming evidence against
him which has been set forth above, only served to prolong the period
during which he was the center of the attention of the entire world.
</p> 
 
<p> <b><a name="conclusions"></a>Conclusion</b> </p>
<p>Many factors were undoubtedly involved in Oswald's motivation for
the assassination, and the Commission does not believe that it can
ascribe to him any one motive or group of motives. It is apparent,
however, that Oswald was moved by an overriding hostility to his
environment. He does not appear to have been able to establish
meaningful relationships with other people. He was perpetually
discontented with the world around him. Long before the assassination
he expressed his hatred for American society and acted in protest
against it. Oswald's search for what he conceived to be the perfect
society was doomed from the start. He sought for himself a place in
history--a role as the "great man" who would be recognized as having
been in advance of his times. His commitment to Marxism and communism
appears to have been another important factor in his motivation. He
</p> <p><b>Page 424</b></p>
<p>also had demonstrated a capacity to act decisively and without regard
to the consequences when such action would further his aims of the
moment. Out of these and the many other factors which may have molded
the character of Lee Harvey Oswald there emerged a man capable of
assassinating President Kennedy.
