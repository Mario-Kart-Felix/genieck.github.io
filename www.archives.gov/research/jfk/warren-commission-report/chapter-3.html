<p> <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>IN THIS chapter the Commission analyzes the evidence and sets forth 
    its conclusions concerning the source, effect, number and timing of the shots that killed President 
    Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally. In that connection the Commission has evaluated (1) the testimony 
    of eyewitnesses present at the scene of the assassination; (2) the damage to the Presidential limousine; 
    (3) the examination by qualified experts of the rifle and cartridge cases found on the sixth floor 
    of the Texas School Book Depository and the bullet fragments found in the Presidential limousine and 
    at Parkland Hospital; (4) the wounds suffered by President Kennedy and Governor Connally; (5) wound 
    ballistics tests; (6) the examination by qualified experts of the clothing worn by President Kennedy 
    and Governor Connally; and (7) motion- picture films and still photographs taken at the time of the 
    assassination.</p>

<p><b>THE WITNESSES</b></p>
<p>As reflected in the previous chapter, passengers in the first few
cars of the motorcade had the impression that the shots came from the
rear and from the right, the general direction of the Texas School
Book Depository Building, although none of these passengers saw anyone
fire the shots.  Some spectators at Houston and Elm Streets, however,
did see a rifle being fired in the direction of the President's car
from the easternmost window of the sixth floor on the south side of
the building.  Other witnesses saw a rifle in this window immediately
after the assassination.  Three employees of the Depository, observing
the parade from the fifth floor, heard the shots fired from the floor
immediately above them.  No credible evidence suggests that the shots
were fired from the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass, the
nearby railroad yards or any place other than the Texas School Book
Depository Building.</p>

November 22, 1963. (Photograph taken on March 20, 1964, and marked by Brennan during his 
testimony to show the window (A) in which he saw a man with a rifle, and the window (B) on the

<p><b>Near the Depository</b></p>

<p>Eyewitnesses testified that they saw a man fire a weapon from the
sixth-floor window. Howard L. Brennan, a 45-year-old steamfitter,
watched the motorcade from a concrete retaining wall at the southwest
corner of Elm and Houston, where he had a clear view of the south side
of the Depository Building.1  (See Commission Exhibit No. 477, p. 62.)
 He was approximately 107 feet from the Depository entrance and 120
feet from the southeast corner window of the sixth floor.2 Brennan's
presence and vantage point are corroborated by a motion picture of the
motorcade taken by amateur photographer Abraham Zapruder, which shows
Brennan, wearing gray khaki work clothes and a gray work helmet,
seated on the retaining wall. 3    Brennan later identified himself in
the Zapruder movie.4 While waiting about 7 minutes for the President
to arrive, he observed the crowd on the street and the people at the
windows of the Depository Building.5 He noticed a man at the southeast
corner window of the sixth floor, and observed him leave the window "a
couple of times." 6</p>
<p>Brennan watched the President's car as it turned the corner at Houston
and Elm and moved down the incline toward the Triple Underpass.  Soon
after the President's car passed, he heard an explosion like the
backfire of a motorcycle. 7    Brennan recalled: </p>
    <blockquote>Well, then something, just right after this explosion, made me think
    that it was a firecracker being thrown from the Texas Book Store.  And
    I glanced up.  And this man that I saw previous was aiming for his
    last shot.<br>
    &deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;<br>
    Well, as it appeared to me he was standing up. and resting against the
    left window sill, with gun shouldered to his right shoulder, holding
    the gun with his left hand and taking positive   aim and fired his
    last shot.  As I calculate a couple of seconds.  He drew the gun back
    from the window as though he was drawing it back to his side and maybe
    paused for another second as though to assure himself that he hit his
    mark, and then he disappeared.8</blockquote>
	<p>
Brennan stated that he saw 70 to 85 percent of the gun when it was
fired and the body of the man from the waist up. 9  The rifle was aimed
southwesterly down Elm Street toward the underpass.10  Brennan saw the
man fire one shot and he remembered hearing a total of only two shots.
 When questioned about the number of shots, Brennan testified:</p>
    <blockquote>I don't know what made me think that there was firecrackers throwed
    out of the Book Store unless I did hear the second shot, because I
    positively thought the first shot was a backfire, and subconsciously I
    must have heard a second shot, but I do not recall it.  I could not
    swear to it.  11 </blockquote>
	<p>
<b>Page 64</b>
</p>

<p>Brennan quickly reported his observations to police officers.12
Brennan's description of the man he saw is discussed in the next
chapter.
</p>

<p>Amos Lee Euins, a 15-year-old ninth grade student, stated that he
was facing the Depository as the motorcade turned the corner at Elm
and Houston.  He recalled: </p>
    <blockquote>Then I was standing here, and as the motorcade turned the corner, I
    was facing, looking dead at the building.  And so I seen this pipe
    thing sticking out the window.  I wasn't paying too much attention to
    it.  Then when the first shot was fired, I started looking around,
    thinking it was a backfire.  Everybody else started looking around.
    Then I looked up at the window, and he shot again.13</blockquote>
	<p>
After witnessing the first shots, Euins hid behind a fountain bench
and saw the man shoot again from the window in the southeast corner of
the Depository's sixth floor.14  According to Euins, the man had one
hand on the barrel and the other on the trigger. Euins believed that
there were four shots.15 Immediately after the assassination, he
reported his observations to Sgt. D. V. Harkness of the Dallas Police
Department and also to James Underwood of station KRLD-TV of Dallas.16
 Sergeant Harkness testified that Euins told him that the shots came
from the last window of the floor "under the ledge" on the side of the
building they were facing.17  Based on Euins' statements, Harkness
radioed to headquarters at 12:36 p.m. that "I have a witness that says
that it came from the fifth floor of the Texas Book Depository Store."
18	 Euins accurately described the sixth floor as the floor "under
the ledge."	Harkness testified that the error in the radio message
was due to his own "hasty count of the floors." 19
</p>

<p>Other witnesses saw a rifle in the window after the shots were
fired. Robert H. Jackson, staff photographer, Dallas Times Herald, was
in a press car in the Presidential motorcade, eight or nine cars from
the front.  On Houston Street about halfway between Main and Elm,
Jackson heard the first shot.20  As someone in the car commented that
it sounded like a firecracker, Jackson heard two more shots.21 He
testified:</p>
    <blockquote>Then  we realized or we thought that it was gunfire, and then we could
    not at that point see the President's car.  We were still moving
    slowly, and after the third shot the second two shots seemed much
    closer together than the first shot, than they were to the first shot.
    Then after the last shot, I guess all of us were just looking all
    around and I just looked straight up ahead of me which would have been
    looking at the School Book Depository and I noticed two Negro men in a
    window straining to see directly above them, and my eyes followed
    right on up to the window above them and I saw the rifle or what
    looked like a rifle approximately half of the weapon, I guess I saw,
    and just as I looked </blockquote>
	
<p><b>Page 65</b>  </p>
    <blockquote>at it, it was drawn fairly slowly back into the building, and I saw no
    one in the window with it. I didn't even see a form in the window.22</blockquote>
	<p>
In the car with Jackson were James Underwood, television station
KRLD-TV; Thomas Dillard, chief photographer, Dallas Morning News;
Malcolm O. Couch and James Darnell, television newsreel cameramen.
Dillard, Underwood, and the driver were in the front seat, Couch and
Darnell were sitting on top of the back seat of the convertible with
Jackson.  Dillard, Couch, and Underwood confirmed that Jackson
spontaneously exclaimed that he saw a rifle in the window.23 According
to Dillard, at the time the shots were fired he and his fellow
passengers "had an absolutely perfect view of the School Depository
from our position in the open car." 24 Dillard immediately took two
pictures of the building: one of the east two-thirds of the south side
and the other of the southeast corner, particularly the fifth- and
sixth-floor windows.25  These pictures show three Negro men in windows
on the fifth floor and the partially open window on the sixth floor
directly above them. (See Dillard Exhibits C and D, pp. 66-67.) 'Couch
also saw the rifle in the window, and testified :</p>
    <blockquote>And after the third shot, Bob Jackson, who was, as I recall, on my
    right, yelled something like, "Look up in the window! There's the
    rifle!" And I remember glancing up to a window on the far right, which
    at the time impressed me as the sixth or seventh floor, and seeing
    about a foot of a rifle being--the barrel brought into the window.26 </blockquote>
	<p>
Couch testified he saw people standing in other windows on the third
or fourth floor in the middle of the south side, one of them being a
Negro in a white T-shirt leaning out to look up at the windows above
him.27
</p>

<p>Mayor and Mrs. Earle Cabell rode in the motorcade immediately
behind the Vice-Presidential follow-up car.28 Mrs. Cabell was seated in
the back seat behind the driver and was facing U.S. Representative Ray
Roberts on her right as the car made the turn at Elm and Houston. In
this position Mrs. Cabell "was actually facing" the seven-story
Depository when the first shot rang out.29 She "jerked" her head up
immediately and saw a "projection" in the first group of windows on a
floor which she described both as the sixth floor and the top floor.30
According to Mrs. Cabell, the object was "rather long looking," but
she was unable to determine whether it was a mechanical object or a
person's arm.31  She turned away from the window to tell her husband
that the noise was a shot, and "just as I got the words out ... the
second two shots rang out." 32  Mrs. Cabell did not look at the
sixth-floor window when the second and third shots were fired.33

<p>James N. Crawford and Mary Ann Mitchell, two deputy district clerks
for Dallas County, watched the motorcade at the southeast corner of
Elm and Houston.  After the President's car turned the corner,
Crawford heard a loud report which he thought was backfire coming from
the direction of the Triple Underpass.34 He heard a second shot
seconds later, followed quickly by a third. At the third shot, he
looked up and saw a "movement" in the far east corner of the sixth
floor of the Depository, the only open window on that floor.35  He
told Miss Mitchell "that if those were shots they came from that
window." When asked to describe the movement more exactly, he said,</p>
    <blockquote>...I would say that it was a profile, somewhat from the waist up,
    but it was a very quick movement. and rather indistinct and it was
    very light colored....<br>
    &deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;<br>
    When I saw it, I automatically in my mind came to the conclusion that
    it was a person having moved out of the window... 36</blockquote>
<p>
He could not state whether the person was a man or a woman.37  Miss
Mitchell confirmed that after the third shot Crawford told her, "Those
shots came from that building." 38  She saw Crawford pointing at a
window but was not sure at which window he was pointing.39

<p><b>On the Fifth Floor</b>
</p>

<p>Three Depository employees shown in the picture taken by Dillard
were on the fifth floor of the building when the shots were fired:
James Jarman, Jr., age 34, a wrapper in the shipping department;
Bonnie Ray Williams, age 20, a warehouseman temporarily assigned to
laying a plywood floor on the sixth floor; and Harold Norman, age 26,
an "order filler."  Norman and Jarman decided to watch the parade
during the lunch hour from the fifth-floor windows.40  From the ground
floor they took the west elevator, which operates with pushbutton
controls, to the fifth floor.41 Meanwhile, Williams had gone up to the
sixth floor where he had been working and ate his lunch on the south
side of that floor. Since he saw no one around when he finished his
lunch, he started down on the east elevator, looking for company. He
left behind his paper lunch sack, chicken bones and an empty pop
bottle.42  Williams went down to the fifth floor, where he joined
Norman and Jarman at approximately 12:20 p.m.43
</p>

<p>Harold Norman was in the fifth-floor window in the southeast
corner, directly under the window where witnesses saw the rifle. (See
Commission Exhibit No. 485, p. 69.)  He could see light through the
ceiling cracks between the fifth and sixth floors.44  As the motorcade
went by, Norman thought that the President was saluting with his right
arm,

<p><b>Page 70</b></p>
	<blockquote>...and I can't remember what the exact time was but I know I
    heard a shot, and then after I heard the shot, well, it seems as
    though the President, you know, slumped or something, and then another
    shot and I believe Jarman or someone told me, he said, "I believe
    someone is shooting at the President," and I think I made a statement
    "It is someone shooting at the President, and I believe it came from
    up above us."<br>
    Well, I couldn't see at all during the time but I know I heard a
    third shot fired, and I could also hear something sounded like the
    shell hulls hitting the floor and the ejecting of the rifle... 45</blockquote>
	<p>
Williams said that he "really did not pay any attention" to the
first shot---</p>
    <blockquote>...because I did not know what was happening. The second shot,
    it sounded like it was right in the building, the second and third
    shot. And it sounded--it even shook the building, the side we were on.
    Cement fell on my head.
    

<p>Q. You say cement fell on your head?
    </p>

<p>A. Cement, gravel, dirt, or something, from the old building,
    because it shook the windows and everything. Harold was sitting next
    to me, and he said it came right from over our head.46</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
Williams testified Norman said "I can even hear the shell being
ejected from the gun hitting the floor." 47
</p>

<p>When Jarman heard the first sound, he thought that it was either a
backfire--</p>
    <blockquote>...or an officer giving a salute to the President.  And then at
    that time I didn't, you know, think too much about it...<br>
    &deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;<br>
    Well, after the third shot was fired, I think I got up and I run
    over to Harold Norman and Bonnie Ray Williams, and told them, I said,
    I told them that it wasn't a backfire or anything, that somebody was
    shooting at the President.48</blockquote>
	<p>
Jarman testified that Norman said "that he thought the shots had come
from above us, and I noticed that Bonnie Ray had a few debris in his
head. It was sort of white stuff, or something." 49 Jarman stated that
Norman said "that he was sure that the shot came from inside the
building because he had been used to guns and all that, and he said it
didn't sound like it was too far off anyway."50 The three men ran to
the west side of the building, where they could look toward the Triple
Underpass to see what had happened to the motorcade.51
</p>

<p>After the men had gone to the window on the west side of the
building, Jarman "got to thinking about all the debris on Bonnie Ray's
head" and said, "That shot probably did come from upstairs, up over
us."52  He testified that Norman said, "I know it did, because I could
</p>

<p><b>Page 71</b>
</p>

<p>hear the action of the bolt, and I could hear the cartridges drop on
the floor."53  After pausing for a few minutes, the three men ran
downstairs.  Norman and Jarman ran out of the front entrance of the
building, where they saw Brennan, the construction worker who had seen
the man in the window firing the gun, talking to a police officer, and
they then reported their own experience.54
</p>

<p>On March 20, 1964, preceding their appearance before the
Commission, these witnesses were interviewed in Dallas.  At that time
members of the Commission's legal staff conducted an experiment.
Norman, Williams, and Jarman placed themselves at the windows of the
fifth floor as they had been on November 22.  A Secret Service agent
operated the bolt of a rifle directly above them at the southeast
corner window of the sixth floor.  At the same time, three cartridge
shells were dropped to the floor at intervals of about 3 seconds.
According to Norman, the noise outside was less on the day of the
assassination than on the day of the test.55  He testified, "Well, I
heard the same sound, the sound similar. I heard three something that
he dropped on the floor and then I could hear the rifle or whatever he
had up there."56  The experiment with the shells and rifle was
repeated for members of the Commission on May 9, 1964, on June 7,
1964, and again on September 6, 1964.  All seven of the Commissioners
clearly heard the shells drop to the floor.

<p><b>At the Triple Underpass</b>
</p>

<p>In contrast to the testimony of the witnesses who heard and
observed shots fired from the Depository, the Commission's
investigation has disclosed no credible evidence that any shots were
fired from anywhere else.  When the shots were fired, many people near
the Depository believed that the shots came from the railroad bridge
over the Triple Underpass or from the area to the west of the
Depository.57  In the hectic moments after the assassination, many
spectators ran in the general direction of the Triple Underpass or
the railroad yards northwest of the building.  Some were running
toward the place from which the sound of the rifle fire appeared to
come, others were fleeing the scene of the shooting.58  None of these
people saw anyone with a rifle, and the Commission's inquiry has
yielded no evidence that shots were fired from the bridge over the
Triple Underpass or from the railroad yards.
</p>

<p>On the day of the motorcade, Patrolman J. W. Foster stood on the
east side of the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass and
Patrolman J. C. White stood on the west side.59  Patrolman Joe E.
Murphy was standing over Elm Street on the Stemmons Freeway overpass,
west of the railroad bridge farther away from the Depository.60  Two
other officers were stationed on Stemmons Freeway to control traffic
as the motorcade entered the Freeway.61  Under the advance
preparations worked out between the Secret Service and the Dallas
Police Department, the policemen were under instructions to keep
"unauthorized" people away from these locations.62  When the 
</p>

<p><b>Page 72</b>
</p>

<p>motorcade reached the intersection of Elm and Houston Streets, there
were no spectators on Stemmons Freeway where Patrolman Murphy was
stationed.63  Patrolman Foster estimated that there were 10 or 11
people on the railroad bridge where he was assigned;64 another witness
testified that there were between 14 and 18 people there as the
motorcade came into view.65 Investigation has disclosed 15 persons who
were on the railroad bridge at this time, including 2 police men, 2
employees of the Texas-Louisiana Freight Bureau and 11 employees of
the Union Terminal Co.66 In the absence of any explicit definition of
"unauthorized" persons, the policemen permitted these employees to
remain on the railroad bridge to watch the motorcade. (See chapter
VIII, pp. 446-447.)	At the request of the policemen, S. M.
Holland, signal supervisor for Union Terminal Co., came to the
railroad bridge at about 11:45 a.m. and remained to identify those
persons who were railroad employees.67 In addition, Patrolman Foster
checked credentials to determine if persons seeking access to the
bridge were railroad employees.68  Persons who were not railroad
employees were ordered away, including one news photographer who
wished only to take a picture of the motorcade.69
</p>

<p>Another employee of the Union Terminal Co., Lee E. Bowers, Jr.,
was at work in a railroad tower about 14 feet above the tracks to the
north of the railroad bridge and northwest of the corner of Elm and
Houston, approximately 50 yards from the back of the Depository.70
(See Commission Exhibit No. 2218, p. 73.)  From the tower he could
view people moving in the railroad yards and at the rear of the
Depository.  According to Bowers, "Since approximately 10 o'clock in
the morning traffic had been cut off into the area so that anyone
moving around could actually be observed."71  During the 20 minutes
prior to the arrival of the motorcade, Bowers noticed three
automobiles which entered his immediate. area; two left without
discharging any passengers and the third was apparently on its way out
when last observed by Bowers.72	Bowers observed only three or four
people in the general area, as well as a few bystanders on the
railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass.73
</p>

<p>As the motorcade proceeded toward the Triple Underpass, the
spectators were clustered together along the east concrete wall of the
railroad bridge facing the oncoming procession.74 (See Commission
Exhibit No. 2215, p. 75.) Patrolman Foster stood immediately behind
them and could observe all of them.75 Secret Service agents in the
lead car of the motorcade observed the bystanders and the police
officer on the bridge.76  Special Agent Winston G. Lawson motioned
through the windshield in an unsuccessful attempt to instruct
Patrolman Foster to move the people away from their position directly
over the path of the motorcade.77 Some distance away, on the Stemmons
Freeway overpass above Elm Street, Patrolman Murphy also had the group
on the railroad bridge within view.78  When he heard the shots, Foster
rushed to the wall of the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass
and looked toward the street.79  After the third shot, Foster ran
toward the Depository and shortly thereafter informed

</p>

<p>Inspector Herbert J. Sawyer of the Dallas Police Department that he
thought the shots came from the vicinity of Elm and Houston.80
</p>

<p>Other witnesses on the railroad bridge had varying views
concerning the source and number of the shots.  Austin L. Miller,
employed by the Texas-Louisiana Freight Bureau, heard three shots and
thought that they came from the area of the Presidential limousine
itself.81 One of his coworkers, Royce G. Skelton, thought he heard
four shots, but could not tell their exact source.82  Frank E. Reilly,
an electrician at Union Terminal, heard three shots which seemed to
come from the trees "On the north side of Elm Street at the corner up
there."83 According to S. M. Holland, there were four shots which
sounded as though they came from the trees on the north side of Elm
Street where he saw a puff of smoke.84  Thomas J. Murphy, a mail
foreman at Union Terminal Co., heard two shots and said that they came
from a spot just west of the Depository.85  In the railroad tower,
Bowers heard three shots, which sounded as though they came either
from the Depository Building or near the mouth of the Triple
Underpass. Prior to November 22, 1963, Bowers had noted the similarity
of the sounds coming from the vicinity of the Depository and those
from the Triple Underpass, which he attributed to "a reverberation
which takes place from either location."86
</p>

<p>Immediately after the shots were fired, neither the policemen the
spectators on the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass saw
anything suspicious on the bridge in their vicinity.  (See Commission
Exhibit No. 2214, p. 74.)  No one saw anyone with a rifle. As he ran
around through the railroad yards to the Depository, Patrolman Foster
saw no suspicious activity.87  The same was true of the other
bystanders, many of whom made an effort after the shooting to observe
any unusual activity.  Holland, for example, immediately after the
shots, ran off the overpass to see if there was anyone behind the
picket fence on the north side of Elm Street, but he did not see
anyone among the parked cars.88 Miller did not see anyone running
across the railroad tracks or on the plaza west of the Depository.89
Bowers and others saw a motorcycle officer dismount hurriedly and come
running up the incline on the north side of Elm Street.90  The
motorcycle officer, Clyde A. Haygood, saw no one running from the
railroad yards.91

<p><b>THE PRESIDENTIAL AUTOMOBILE</b>
</p>

<p>After the Presidential car was returned to Washington on November
22, 1963, Secret Service agents found two bullet fragments in the
front seat.  One fragment, found on the seat beside the driver,
weighed 44.6 grains and consisted of the nose portion of a bullet.92
The other fragment, found along the right side of the front seat,
weighed 21.0 grains and consisted of the base portion of a bullet.93
During the course of an examination on November 23, agents of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation found three small lead particles,
weighing 
</p>

<p><b>Page 77</b>
</p>

<p>between seven-tenths and nine-tenths of a grain each, on the rug
underneath the left jump seat which had been occupied by Mrs.
Connally.94  During this examination, the Bureau agents noted a small
residue of lead on the inside surface of the laminated windshield and
a very small pattern of cracks on the outer layer of the windshield
immediately behind the lead residue.95  There was a minute particle of
glass missing from the outside surface, but no penetration. The inside
layer of glass was not broken.96 The agents also observed a dent in
the strip of chrome across the top of the windshield, located to the
left of the rear view mirror support.97
</p>

<p>The lead residue on the inside of the windshield was compared
under spectrographic analysis by FBI experts with the bullet fragments
found on and alongside the front seat and with the fragments under the
left jump seat. It was also compared with bullet fragments found at
Parkland Hospital. All these bullet fragments were found to be similar
in metallic composition, but it was not possible to determine whether
two or more of the fragments came from the same bullet.98  It is
possible for the fragments from the front seat to have been a part of
the same bullet as the three fragments found near the left jump
seat,99 since a whole bullet of this type weighs 160-161, grains.100
(See app. X, pp. 555-558.) 
</p>

<p>The physical characteristics of the windshield after the
assassination demonstrate that the windshield was struck on the inside
surface. The windshield is composed of two layers of glass with a very
thin layer of plastic in the middle "which bonds them together in the
form of safety glass."101 The windshield was extracted from the
automobile and was examined during a Commission hearing.102  (See
Commission Exhibit No. 350, p. 78.)  According to Robert A. Frazier,
FBI firearms expert, the fact that cracks were present on the outer
layer of glass showed that the glass had been struck from the inside.
He testified that the windshield </p>
    <blockquote>could not have been struck on the outside surface because of the
    manner in which the glass broke and further because of the lead residue on the inside surface.
    The cracks appear in the outer layer of the glass because the glass  is bent outward at the time of
    impact which stretches the outer layer of the glass to the point where these small 	radial or wagon
    spoke, wagon wheel spoke-type cracks appear on the outer surface.103</blockquote>
	<p>
Although there is some uncertainty whether the dent in the chrome on
the windshield was present prior to the assassination,104 Frazier
testified that the dent "had been caused by some projectile which
struck the chrome on the inside surface."105 If it was caused by a
shot during the assassination, Frazier stated that it would not have
been caused by a bullet traveling at full velocity, but rather by a
fragment traveling at "fairly high velocity."106  It could have been
caused by either fragment found in the front seat of the limousine.107

<p><b>EXPERT EXAMINATION OF RIFLE, CARTRIDGE CASES, 
AND BULLET FRAGMENTS</b>
</p>

<p>On the sixth floor of the Depository Building, the Dallas police
found three spent cartridges and a rifle.  A nearly whole bullet was
discovered on the stretcher used to carry Governor Connally at
Parkland Hospital.  As described in the preceding section, five bullet
fragments were found in the President's limousine.  The cartridge
cases, the nearly whole bullet and the bullet fragments were all
subjected to firearms identification analysis by qualified experts.
It was the unanimous opinion of the experts that the nearly whole
bullet, the two largest. bullet fragments. and the three cartridge
cases were definitely fired in the rifle found on the sixth floor of
the Depository Building to the exclusion of all other weapons.
</p>

<p><a href="chapter-3.html#top" name="discovery"> Return to Top</a></p>

<p><b>Discovery of Cartridge Cases and Rifle</b>
</p>

<p>Shortly after the assassination, police officers arrived at the
Depository Building and began a search for the assassin and
evidence.108 Around 1 p.m. Deputy Sheriff Luke Mooney noticed a pile
of cartons in front of the window in the southeast corner of the sixth
floor.109 (See Commission Exhibit No. 723, p. 80.)  Searching that
area he found at approximately 1:12 p.m. three empty cartridge cases
on the floor near the window.110  When he was notified of Mooney's
discovery, Capt. J. W. Fritz, chief of the homicide bureau of the
Dallas Police Department, issued instructions that nothing be moved or
touched until technicians from the police crime laboratory could take
photographs and check for fingerprints.111  Mooney stood guard to see
that nothing was disturbed.112 A few minutes later, Lt. J. C. Day of
the Dallas Police Department arrived and took photographs of the
cartridge cases before anything had been moved.113
</p>

<p>At 1:22 p.m. Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone and Deputy Constable
Seymour Weitzman found a bolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight
between two rows of boxes in the northwest corner near the staircase
on the sixth floor.114  No one touched the weapon or otherwise
disturbed the scene until Captain Fritz and Lieutenant Day arrived and
the weapon was photographed as it lay on the floor.115  After
Lieutenant Day determined that there were no fingerprints on the knob
of the bolt and that the wooden stock was too rough to take
fingerprints, he picked the rifle up by the stock and held it that way
while Captain Fritz opened the bolt and ejected a live round.116
Lieutenant Day retained possession of the weapon and took it back to
the police department for examination.117 Neither Boone nor Weitzman
handled the rifle.118

<a name="bullet"></a>
<p><b>Discovery of Bullet at Parkland Hospital</b>
</p>

<p>A nearly whole bullet was found on Governor Connally's
stretcher at Parkland Hospital after the assassination. After his
arrival at the hospital the Governor was brought into trauma room No.
2 on a </p>
<p><b>Page 80</b></p>

<p><b>Page 81</b></p>
<p>stretcher, removed from the room on that stretcher a short time later,
and taken on an elevator to the second-floor operating room.119 On the
second floor he was transferred from the stretcher to an operating
table which was then moved into the operating room, and a hospital
attendant wheeled the empty stretcher into an elevator.120  Shortly
afterward, Darrell C. Tomlinson, the hospital's senior engineer,
removed this stretcher from the elevator and placed it in the corridor
on the ground floor, alongside another stretcher wholly unconnected
with the care of Governor Connally.121   A few minutes later, he
bumped one of the stretchers against the wall and a bullet rolled
out.122</p>
<p>Although Tomlinson was not certain whether the bullet came
from the Connally stretcher or the adjacent one, the Commission has
concluded that the bullet came from the Governor's stretcher. That
conclusion is buttressed by evidence which eliminated President
Kennedy's stretcher as a source of the bullet.  President Kennedy
remained on the stretcher on which he was carried into the hospital
while the doctors tried to save his life.123  He was never removed
from the stretcher from the time he was taken into the emergency room
until his body was placed in a casket in that same room.124 After the
President's body was removed from that stretcher, the linen was taken
off and placed in a hamper and the stretcher was pushed into trauma
room No. 2, a completely different location from the site where the
nearly whole bullet was found.125</p>

<a name="description"></a>
 
<p><b>Description of Rifle</b></p>
<p>The bolt-action, clip-fed rifle found on the sixth floor of
the Depository, described more fully in appendix X, is inscribed with
various markings, including "MADE ITALY," "CAL. 6.5," "1940" and the
number C2766.126 (See Commission Exhibit Nos. 1303, 541(2) and 541
(3), pp. 82-83.)	These markings have been explained as follows:
"MADE ITALY" refers to its origin; "CAL. 6.5" refers to the rifle's
caliber; "1940" refers to the year of manufacture; and the number
C2766 is the serial number. This rifle is the only one of its type
bearing that serial number.127  After review of standard reference
works and the markings on the rifle, it was identified by the FBI as a
6.5-millimeter model 91/38 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.128 Experts from
the FBI made an independent determination of the caliber by inserting
a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter cartridge into the weapon for fit,
and by making a sulfur cast of the inside of the weapon's barrel and
measuring the cast with a micrometer.129  From outward appearance, the
weapon would appear to be a 7.35-millimeter rifle, but its mechanism
had been rebarreled with a 6.5-millimeter barrel.130 Constable Deputy
Sheriff Weitzman, who only saw the rifle at a glance and did not
handle it, thought the weapon looked like a 7.65 Mauser bolt-action
rifle.131  (See chapter V, p. 235.) </p>
 

<p>The rifle is 40.2 inches long and weighs 8 pounds.132  The minimum
length broken down is 34.8 inches, the length of the wooden stock.133

bears a sling consisting of two leather straps. The sling is not a
standard rifle sling but appears to be a musical instrument strap or a
sling from a carrying case or camera bag.135

 <a name="testimony"> </a> 

<p><b>Expert Testimony</b>
</p>

<p>Four experts in the field of firearms identification analyzed the
nearly whole bullet, the two largest fragments and the three cartridge
cases to determine whether they had been fired from the C2766
Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository.
Two of these experts testified before the Commission.  One was Robert
A. Frazier, a special agent of the FBI assigned to the FBI Laboratory
in Washington, D.C.  Frazier has worked generally in the field of
firearms identification for 23 years, examining firearms of various
types for the purpose of identifying the caliber and other
characteristics of the weapons and making comparisons of bullets and
cartridge cases for the purpose of determining whether or not they
were fired in a particular weapon.136  He estimated that he has made
"in the neighborhood of 50,000 to 60,000" firearms comparisons and has
testified in court on about 400 occasions.137 The second witness who
testified on this subject was Joseph D. Nicol, superintendent of the
bureau of criminal identification and investigation for the State of
Illinois. Nicol also has had long and substantial experience since
1941 in firearms identification, and estimated that he has made
thousands of bullet and cartridge case examinations.138
</p>

<p>In examining the bullet fragments and cartridge cases, these
experts applied the general principles accepted in the field of
firearms identification, which are discussed in more detail in
appendix X at pages 547-553.  In brief, a determination that a particular
bullet or cartridge case has been fired in a particular weapon is
based upon a comparison of the bullet or case under examination with
one or more bullets or cases known to have been fired in that weapon.
When a bullet is fired in any given weapon, it is engraved with the
characteristics of the weapon.  In addition to the rifling
characteristics of the barrel which are common to all weapons of a
given make and model, every weapon bears distinctive microscopic
markings on its barrel, firing pin and bolt face.139 These markings
arise initially during manufacture, since the action of the
manufacturing tools differs microscopically from weapon to weapon and
since, in addition, the tools change microscopically while being used.
As a weapon is used further distinctive markings are introduced. Under
microscopic examination a qualified expert may be able to determine
whether the markings on a bullet known to have been fired in a
particular weapon and the markings on a suspect bullet are the same
and, therefore, whether both bullets were fired in the same weapon 
</p>

<p><b>Page 85</b>
</p>

<p>to the exclusion of all other weapons.  Similarly, firearms
identification experts are able to compare the markings left upon the
base of cartridge cases and thereby determine whether both cartridges
were fired by the same weapon to the exclusion of all other weapons.
According to Frazier, such an identification "is made on the presence
of sufficient individual microscopic characteristics so that a very
definite pattern is formed and visualized on the two surfaces."140
Under some circumstances, as where the bullet or cartridge case is
seriously mutilated, there are not sufficient individual
characteristics to enable the expert to make a firm identification.141
</p>

<p>After making independent examinations, both Frazier and Nicol
positively identified the nearly whole bullet from the stretcher and
the two larger bullet fragments found in the Presidential limousine as
having been fired in the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the
Depository to the exclusion of all other weapons.142  Each of the two
bullet fragments had sufficient unmutilated area to provide the basis
for an identification.143  However, it was not possible to determine
whether the two bullet fragments were from the same bullet or from two
different bullets.144  With regard to the other bullet fragments
discovered in the limousine and in the course of treating President
Kennedy and Governor Connally, however, expert examination could
demonstrate only that the fragments were "similar in metallic
composition" to each other, to the two larger fragments and to the
nearly whole bullet.145 After examination of the three cartridge cases
found on the sixth floor of the Depository, Frazier and Nicol
concluded that they had been fired in the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle to the exclusion of all other weapons.146  Two other experts
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who made independent
examinations of the nearly whole bullet, bullet fragments and
cartridge cases, reached the identical conclusions.147

<p><b>THE BULLET WOUNDS</b>
</p>

<p>In considering the question of the source of the shots fired at
President Kennedy and Governor Connally, the Commission has also
evaluated the expert medical testimony of the doctors who observed the
wounds during the emergency treatment at Parkland Hospital and during
the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital.  It paid particular attention
to any wound characteristics which would be of assistance in
identifying a wound as the entrance or exit point of a missile.
Additional information regarding the source and nature of the injuries
was obtained by expert examination of the clothes worn by the two men,
particularly those worn by President Kennedy, and from the results of
special wound ballistics tests conducted at the Commission's request,
using the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle with ammunition of the same
type as that used and found on November 22, 1963.
</p>

 <a name="head"></a>
<p><b>The President's Head Wounds</b>
</p>

<p>The detailed autopsy of President Kennedy performed on the night
of November 22 at the Bethesda Naval Hospital led the three examining
pathologists to conclude that the smaller hole in the rear of the
President's skull was the point of entry and that the large opening on
the right side of his head was the wound of exit.148  The smaller hole
on the back of the President's head measured one-fourth of an inch by
five-eighths of an inch (6 by 15 millimeters).149  The dimensions of
that wound were consistent with having been caused by a 6.5-millimeter
bullet fired from behind and above which struck at a tangent or an
angle causing a 15-millimeter cut.  The cut reflected a larger
dimension of entry than the bullet's diameter of 6.5 millimeters,
since the missile, in effect, sliced along the skull for a fractional
distance until it entered.150  The dimension of 6 millimeters,
somewhat smaller than the diameter of a 6.5-millimeter bullet, was
caused by the elastic recoil of the skull which shrinks the size of an
opening after a missile passes through it.151
</p>

<p>Lt. Col. Pierre A. Finck, Chief of the Wound Ballistics Pathology
Branch of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, who has had
extensive experience with bullet wounds, illustrated the
characteristics which led to his conclusions about the head wound by a
chart prepared by him.  This chart, based on Colonel Finck's studies
of more than 400 cases, depicted the effect of a perforating missile
wound on the human skull.152  When a bullet enters the skull (cranial
vault) at one point and exits at another, it causes a beveling or
cratering effect where the diameter of the hole is smaller on the
impact side than on the exit side.  Based on his observations of that
beveling effect on the President's skull, Colonel Finck testified:
"President Kennedy was, in my opinion, shot from the rear.  The bullet
entered in the back of the head and went out on the right side of his
skull ... he was shot from above and behind."153
</p>

<p>Comdr. James J. Humes, senior pathologist and director of
laboratories at the Bethesda Naval Hospital, who acted as chief
autopsy surgeon, concurred in Colonel Finck's analysis.  He compared
the beveling or coning effect to that caused by a BB shot which
strikes a pane of glass, causing a round or oval defect on the side of
the glass where the missile strikes and a belled-out or coned-out
surface on the opposite side of the glass.154  Referring to the bullet
hole on the back of President Kennedy's head, Commander Humes
testified: "The wound on the inner table, however, was larger and had
what in the field of wound ballistics is described as a shelving or
coning effect."155 After studying the other hole in the President's
skull, Commander Humes stated: "... we concluded that the large
defect to the upper right side of the skull, in fact, would represent
a wound of exit."156  Those characteristics led Commander Humes and
Comdr. J. Thornton Boswell, chief of pathology at Bethesda Naval
Hospital, who assisted in the autopsy, to conclude that the bullet
</p>

<p><b>Page 87</b>
</p>

<p>penetrated the rear of the President's head and exited through a large
wound on the right side of his head.157
</p>

<p>Ballistics experiments (discussed more fully in app. X, pp.
585-586) showed that the rifle and bullets identified above were
capable of producing the President's head wound. The Wound Ballistics
Branch of the U.S. Army laboratories at Edgewood Arsenal, Md.,
conducted an extensive series of experiments to test the effect of
Western Cartridge Co. 6.5-millimeter bullets, the type found on
Governor Connally's stretcher and in the Presidential limousine, fired
from the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the Depository. The
Edgewood Arsenal tests were performed under the immediate supervision
of Alfred G. Olivier, a doctor who had spent 7 years in wounds
ballistics research for the U.S. Army.158
</p>

<p>One series of tests, performed on reconstructed inert human
skulls, demonstrated that the President's head wound could have been
caused by the rifle and bullets fired by the assassin from the
sixth-floor window.  The results of this series were illustrated by
the findings on one skull which was struck at a point closely
approximating the wound of entry on President Kennedy's head.  That
bullet blew out the right side of the reconstructed skull in a manner
very similar to the head wound of the President.159  As a result of
these tests, Dr. Olivier concluded that a Western Cartridge Co. 6.5
bullet fired from the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle at a distance of
90 yards would make the same type of wound as that found on the
President's head. Referring to the series of tests, Dr. Olivier
testified:</p>
    <blockquote>It disclosed that the type of head wounds that the President
    received could be done by this type of bullet.  This surprised me very much, because this type of stable
    bullet I didn't think would cause a massive head wound, I thought it would go through making a small
    entrance and exit, but the bones of the skull are enough to deform the end of this bullet causing it
    to expend a lot of energy and blowing out the side of the skull or blowing out fragments of the
    skull.160</blockquote>
	<p>
After examining the fragments of the bullet which struck the
reconstructed skull, Dr. Olivier stated that--</p>
    <blockquote>the recovered fragments were very similar to the ones recovered on
    the front seat and on the floor of the car.  This, to me, indicates that those fragments did come
    from the bullet that wounded the President in the head.161</blockquote>
	
<a name="neck"> </a> 


<p></p>


<p><b>The President's Neck Wounds</b>
</p>

<p>During the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital another bullet
wound was observed near the base of the back of President Kennedy's
neck slightly to the right of his spine which provides further
enlightenment as to the source of the shots. The hole was located
approximately 
</p>

<p><b>Page 88</b>
</p>

<p>5 1/2 inches (14 centimeters) from the tip of the right shoulder joint
and approximately the same distance below the tip of the right mastoid
process, the bony point immediately behind the ear.162 The wound was
approximately one-fourth by one-seventh of an inch (7 by 4
millimeters), had clean edges, was sharply delineated, and had margins
similar in all respects to those of the entry wound in the skull.163
Commanders Humes and Boswell agreed with Colonel Finck's testimony
that this hole.</p>
    <blockquote>... is a wound of entrance... The basis for that
    conclusion is that this wound was relatively 	small 	with clean
    edges. It was not a jagged wound, and that is what we see in wound of
    entrance at a long range.164</blockquote>
	<p>
The autopsy examination further disclosed that, after entering
the President, the bullet passed between two large muscles, produced a
contusion on the upper part of the pleural cavity (without penetrating
that cavity), bruised the top portion of the right lung and ripped the
windpipe (trachea) in its path through the President's neck.165 The
examining surgeons concluded that the wounds were caused by the bullet
rather than the tracheotomy performed at Parkland Hospital. The nature
of the bruises indicated that the President's heart and lungs were
functioning when the bruises were caused, whereas there was very
little circulation in the President's body when incisions on the
President's chest were made to insert tubes during the tracheotomy.166
 No bone was struck by the bullet which passed through the President's
body.167  By projecting from a point of entry on the rear of the neck
and proceeding at a slight downward angle through the bruised interior
portions, the doctors concluded that the bullet exited from the front
portion of the President's neck that had been cut away by the
tracheotomy.168
</p>

<p>Concluding that a bullet passed through the President's neck, the
doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital rejected a theory that the bullet
lodged in the large muscles in the back of his neck and fell out
through the point of entry when external heart massage was applied at
Parkland Hospital.  In the earlier stages of the autopsy, the surgeons
were unable to find a path into any large muscle in the back of the
neck. At that time they did not know that there had been a bullet hole
in the front of the President's neck when he arrived at Parkland
Hospital because the tracheotomy incision had completely eliminated
that evidence.169  While the autopsy was being performed, surgeons
learned that a whole bullet had been found at Parkland Hospital on a
stretcher which, at that time, was thought to be the stretcher
occupied by the President.  This led to speculation that the bullet
might have penetrated a short distance into the back of the neck and
then dropped out onto the stretcher as a result of the external heart
massage.170
</p>

<p>Further exploration during the autopsy disproved that theory.
The surgeons determined that the bullet had passed between two large
strap muscles and bruised them without leaving any channel, since the
bullet 
</p>

<p><b>Page 89</b>
</p>

<p>merely passed between them.171 Commander Humes, who believed that a
tracheotomy had been performed from his observations at the autopsy,
talked by telephone with Dr. Perry early on the morning of November
23, and learned that his assumption was correct and that Dr. Perry had
used the missile wound in the neck as the point to make the
incision.172  This confirmed the Bethesda surgeons' conclusion that
the bullet had exited from the front part of the neck.
</p>

<p>The findings of the doctors who conducted the autopsy were
consistent with the observations of the doctors who treated the
President. at Parkland Hospital.  Dr. Charles S. Carrico, a resident
surgeon at Parkland, noted a small wound approximately one-fourth of
an inch in diameter (5 to 8 millimeters) in the lower third of the
neck below the Adam's apple.173  Dr. Malcolm O. Perry, who performed
the tracheotomy, described the wound as approximately one-fifth of an
inch in diameter (5 millimeters) and exuding blood which partially hid
edges that were "neither cleancut, that is, punched out, nor were they
very ragged."174  Dr. Carrico testified as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p>
    Q. Based on your observations on the neck wound alone did
have a sufficient basis to form an opinion as to whether it was
entrance or an exit wound?
    </p>

<p>A. No, sir; we did not.  Not having completely evaluated all the
wounds, traced out the course of the bullets, this wound would have
been compatible with either entrance or exit wound depending upon the
size, the velocity, the tissue structure and so forth.175</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The same response was made by Dr. Perry to a similar query:</p>
<blockquote><p>
    Q. Based on the appearance of the neck wound alone, could it have
been either an entrance or an exit wound?
    </p>

<p>A. It could have been either.176</p></blockquote>
	<p>
Then each doctor was asked to take into account the other known facts,
such as the autopsy findings, the approximate distance the bullet
traveled and tested muzzle velocity of the assassination weapon.  With
these additional factors, the doctors commented on the wound on the
front of the President's neck as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
   Dr. Carrico. With those facts and the fact. as I understand it no
other bullet was found this would be, this was, I believe, was an exit
wound.177
    </p>

<p>Dr. Perry. A full jacketed bullet without deformation passing
through skin would leave a similar wound for an exit and entrance
wound and with the facts which yon have made available and with these
assumptions, I believe that it was an exit wound.178</p></blockquote>
<p>
Other doctors at Parkland Hospital who observed the wound prior
to the tracheotomy agreed with the observations of Drs. Perry and
Carrico.179  The bullet wound in the neck could be seen for only a
short time, since Dr. Perry eliminated evidence of it when he
performed 
</p>

<p><b>Page 90</b>
</p>

<p>the tracheotomy.  He selected that spot since it was the point where
such an operation was customarily performed, and it was one of the
safest and easiest spots from which to reach the trachea.  In
addition, there was possibly an underlying wound to the muscles in the
neck, the carotid artery or the jugular vein, and Dr. Perry concluded
that the incision, therefore, had to be low in order to maintain
respiration.180
</p>

<p>Considerable confusion has arisen because of comments
attributed to Dr. Perry concerning the nature of the neck wound.
Immediately after the assassination, many people reached erroneous
conclusions about the source of the shots because of Dr. Perry's
observations to the press.  On the afternoon of November 22, a press
conference was organized at Parkland Hospital by members of the White
House press staff and a hospital administrator. Newsmen with
microphones and cameras were crowded into a room to hear statements by
Drs. Perry and William Kemp Clark, chief neurosurgeon at Parkland, who
had attended to President Kennedy's head injury. Dr. Perry described
the situation as "bedlam."181  The confusion was compounded by the
fact that some questions were only partially answered before other
questions were asked.182
</p>

<p>At the news conference, Dr. Perry answered a series of
hypothetical questions and stated to the press that a variety of
possibilities could account for the President's wounds.  He stated
that a single bullet could have caused the President's wounds by
entering through the throat, striking the spine, and being deflected
upward with the point of exit being through the head.183 This would
have accounted for the two wounds he observed, the hole in the front
of the neck and the large opening in the skull.  At that time, Dr.
Perry did not know about either the wound on the back of the
President's neck or the small bullet-hole wound in the back of the
head.  As described in chapter II, the President was lying on his back
during his entire time at Parkland. The small hole in the head was
also hidden from view by the large quantity of blood which covered the
President's head. Dr. Perry said his answers at the press conference
were intended to convey his theory about what could have happened,
based on his limited knowledge at the time, rather than his
professional opinion about what did happen.184 Commenting on his
answers at the press conference, Dr. Perry testified before the
Commission:</p>
    <blockquote>I expressed it [his answers] as a matter of speculation that this
    was conceivable.  But, again, Dr. Clark [who also answered questions
    at the conference] and I emphasized that we had no way of knowing.185</blockquote>
	<p>
Dr. Perry's recollection of his comments is corroborated by some of
the news stories after the press conference.  The New York Herald
Tribune on November 23, 1963, reported as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>Dr. Malcolm Perry, 34, attendant surgeon at Parkland Hospital who
    attended the President, said he saw two wounds--</blockquote>
<p><b>Page 91</b>
</p>

<p>one below the Adam's apple, the other at the back of the head. He said
he did not know if two bullets were involved.  It is possible, he
said, that the neck wound was the entrance and the other the exit of
the missile.186
</p>

<p>According to this report, Dr. Perry stated merely that it was
"possible" that the neck wound was a wound of entrance.  This conforms
with his testimony before the Commission, where he stated that by
themselves the characteristics of the neck wound were consistent with
being either a point of entry or exit.</p>

<p>Wound ballistics tests.--Experiments performed by the Army Wound
Ballistics experts at Edgewood Arsenal, Md. (discussed in app. X, p.
582) showed that under simulated conditions entry and exit wounds are
very similar in appearance. After reviewing the path of the bullet
through the President's neck, as disclosed in the autopsy report, the
experts simulated the neck by using comparable material with a
thickness of approximately 5&frac12; inches (13&frac12; to 14&frac12; centimeters), which
was the distance traversed by the bullet.  Animal skin was placed on
each side, and Western Cartridge Co. 6.5 bullets were fired from the
C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle from a distance of 180 feet.  The
animal skin on the entry side showed holes which were regular and
round.  On the exit side two holes were only slightly elongated,
indicating that the bullet had become only a little unstable at the
point of exit.187  A third exit hole was round, although not quite as
regular as the entry holes.188  The exit holes, especially the one
most nearly round, appeared similar to the descriptions given by Drs.
Perry and Carrico of the hole in the front of the President's neck.189</p>

<p>The autopsy disclosed that the bullet which entered the back of
the President's neck hit no bony structure and proceeded in a slightly
downward angle. The markings on the President's clothing indicate that
the bullet moved in a slight right to left lateral direction as it
passed through the President's body.190 After the examining doctors
expressed the thought that a bullet would have lost very little
velocity in passing through the soft tissue of the neck, wound
ballistics experts conducted tests to measure the exit velocity of the
bullet.191 The tests were the same as those used to create entry and
exit holes, supplemented by the use of break-type screens which
measured the velocity of bullets. The entrance velocity of the bullet
fired from the rifle averaged 1,904 feet per second after it traveled
180 feet.  The exit velocity averaged 1,772 to 1,798 feet per second,
depending upon the substance through which the bullet passed. A
photograph of the path of the bullet traveling through the simulated
neck showed that it proceeded in a straight line and was stable.192</p>

<p>Examination of clothing.--The clothing worn by President
Kennedy on November 22 had holes and tears which showed that a missile
entered the back of his clothing in the vicinity of his lower neck and
exited through the front of his shirt immediately behind his tie,
nicking the knot of his tie in its forward flight.193 Although the
caliber of the bullet could not be determined and some of the clothing
items </p>
 

<p><b>Page 92</b>
</p>

<p>precluded a positive determination that some tears were made by a
bullet, all the defects could have been caused by a 6.5-millimeter
bullet entering the back of the President's lower neck and exiting in
the area of the knot of his tie.194
</p>

<p>An examination of the suit jacket worn by the President by FBI
Agent Frazier revealed a roughly circular hole approximately
one-fourth of an inch in diameter on the rear of the coat, 5 3/8
inches below the top of the collar and 1 3/4 inches to the right of
the center back seam of the coat.195 The hole was visible on the upper
rear of the coat slightly to the right of center.  Traces of copper
were found in the margins of the hole and the cloth fibers around the
margins were pushed inward.196  Those characteristics established that
the hole was caused by an entering bullet.197 Although the precise
size of the bullet could not be determined from the hole, it was
consistent with having been made by a 6.5-millimeter bullet.198
</p>

<p>The shirt worn by the President contained a hole on the back
side 5 3/4 inches below the top of the collar and 1 1/8 inches to the
right of the middle of the back of the shirt.199  The hole on the rear
of the shirt was approximately circular in shape and about one-fourth
of an inch in diameter, with the fibers pressed inward.200  These
factors established it as a bullet entrance hole.201 The relative
position of the hole in the back of the suit jacket to the hole in the
back of the shirt indicated that both were caused by the same
penetrating missile.202
</p>

<p>On the front of the shirt, examination revealed a hole
seven-eighths of an inch below the collar button and a similar opening
seven-eighths of an inch below the buttonhole. These two holes fell
into alinement on overlapping positions when the shirt was
buttoned.203 Each hole was a vertical, ragged slit approximately
one-half of an inch in height, with the cloth fibers protruding
outward. Although the characteristics of the slit established that the
missile had exited to the front, the irregular nature of the slit
precluded a positive determination that it was a bullet hole.204
However, the hole could have been caused by a round bullet although
the characteristics were not sufficiently clear to enable the
examining expert to render a conclusive opinion.205
</p>

<p>When the President's clothing was removed at Parkland Hospital,
his tie was cut. off by severing the loop immediately to the wearer's
left of the knot, leaving the knot in its original condition.206 The
tie had a nick on the left side of the knot.207   The nick was
elongated horizontally, indicating that the tear was made by some
object moving horizontally, but the fibers were not affected in a
manner which would shed light on the direction or the nature of the
missile.208

<p><b>The Governor's Wounds</b>
</p>

<p>While riding in the right jump seat of the Presidential
limousine on November 22, Governor Connally sustained wounds of the
back, chest, right wrist and left thigh. Because of the small size and
dean-cut edges of the wound on the Governor's back, Dr. Robert Shaw
concluded that it was an entry wound.209  The bullet traversed the
Governor's 
</p>

<p><b>Page 93</b>  
</p>

<p>chest in a downward angle, shattering his fifth rib, and exited below
the right nipple.210  The ragged edges of the 2-inch (5 centimeters)
opening on the front of the chest led Dr. Shaw to conclude that it was
the exit point of the bullet.211  When Governor Connally testified
before the Commission 5 months after the assassination, on April 21,
1964, the Commission observed the Governor's chest wounds, as well as
the injuries to his wrist and thigh and watched Dr. Shaw measure with
a caliper an angle of declination of 25&deg; from the point of entry on
the back to the point of exit on the front of the Governor's chest.212
</p>

<p>At the time of the shooting, Governor Connally was unaware that
he had sustained any injuries other than his chest wounds.213 On the
back of his arm, about 2 inches (5 centimeters) above the wrist joint
on the thumb side, Dr. Charles F. Gregory observed a linear
perforating wound approximately one-fifth of an inch (one-half
centimeter) wide and 1 inch (2 1/2 centimeters) long.214  During his
operation on this injury, the doctor concluded that this ragged wound
was the point of entry because thread and cloth had been carried into
the wound to the region of the bone.215 Dr. Gregory's conclusions were
also based upon the location in the Governor's wrist, as revealed by
X-ray, of small fragments of metal shed by the missile upon striking
the firm surface of the bone.216 Evidence of different amounts of air
in the tissues of the wrist gave further indication that the bullet
passed from the back to the front of the wrist.217  An examination of
the palm surface of the wrist showed a wound approximately one-fifth
of an inch (one-half centimeter) long and approximately three-fourths
of an inch (2 centimeters) above the crease of the right wrist.218 Dr.
Shaw had initially believed that the missile entered on the palm side
of the Governor's wrist and exited on the back side.219 After
reviewing the factors considered by Dr. Gregory, however, Dr. Shaw
withdrew his earlier opinion. He deferred to the judgment of Dr.
Gregory, who had more closely examined that wound during the wrist
operation.220
</p>

<p>In addition, Governor Connally suffered a puncture wound in the
left thigh that was approximately two-fifths of an inch (1 centimeter)
in diameter and located approximately 5 or 6 inches above the
Governor's left knee.221  On the Governor's leg, very little
soft-tissue damage was noted, which indicated a tangential wound or
the penetration of a larger missile entering at low velocity and
stopping after entering the skin.222  X-ray examination disclosed a
tiny metallic fragment embedded in the Governor's leg.223 The surgeons
who attended the Governor concluded that the thigh wound was not
caused by the small fragment in the thigh but resulted from the impact
of a larger missile.224
</p>

<p>Examination of clothing.--The clothing worn by Governor
Connally on November 22, 1963, contained holes which matched his
wounds. On the back of the Governor's coat, a hole was found 1 1/8
inches from the seam where the right sleeve attached to the coat and 7
1/4 inches to the right of the midline.225  This hole was elongated in
a horizontal direction approximately five-eighths of an inch in length
</p>

<p><b>Page 94</b>
</p>

<p>and one-fourth of an inch in height.226  The front side of the
Governor's coat contained a circular hole three-eighths of an inch in
diameter, located 5 inches to the right of the front right edge of the
coat slightly above the top button.227 A rough hole approximately
five-eighths of an inch in length and three-eighths of an inch in
width was found near the end of the right sleeve.228 Each of these
holes could have been caused by a bullet, but a positive determination
of this fact or the direction of the missile was not possible because
the garment had been cleaned and pressed prior to any opportunity for
a scientific examination.229
</p>

<p>An examination of the Governor's shirt disclosed a very ragged
tear five-eighths of an inch long horizontally and one-half of an inch
vertically on the back of the shirt near the right sleeve 2 inches
from the line where the sleeve attaches.230 Immediately to the right
was another small tear, approximately three-sixteenths of an inch
long.231 The two holes corresponded in position to the hole in the
back of the Governor's coat.232  A very irregular tear in the form of
an "H" was observed on the front side of the Governor's shirt,
approximately 1 1/2 inches high, with a crossbar tear approximately 1
inch wide, located 5 inches from the right side seam and 9 inches from
the top of the right sleeve.233  Because the shirt had been laundered,
there were insufficient characteristics for the expert examiner to
form a conclusive opinion on the direction or nature of the object
causing the holes.234  The rear hole could have been caused by the
entrance of a 6.5-millimeter bullet and the front hole by the exit of
such a bullet.235
</p>

<p>On the French cuff of the right sleeve of the Governor's shirt
was a ragged, irregularly shaped hole located 1 1/2 inches from the
end of the sleeve and 5 1/2 inches from the outside cuff-link hole.236
 The characteristics after laundering did not permit positive
conclusions but these holes could have been caused by a bullet passing
through the Governor's right wrist from the back to the front
sides.237	The Governor's trousers contained a hole approximately
one-fourth of an inch in diameter in the region of the left knee.238
The roughly circular shape of the hole and the slight tearing away
from the edges gave the hole the general appearance of a bullet hole
but it was not possible to determine the direction of the missile
which caused the hole.239
</p>

<p>Course of bullet.--Ballistics experiments and medical findings
established that the missile which passed through the Governor's wrist
and penetrated his thigh had first traversed his chest.  The Army
Wound Ballistics experts conducted tests which proved that the
Governor's wrist wound was not caused by a pristine bullet.  (See app.
X, pp. 582-585.)  A bullet is pristine immediately on exiting from a
rifle muzzle when it moves in a straight line with a spinning motion
and maintains its uniform trajectory with but a minimum of nose
surface striking the air through which it passes.240   When the
straight line of flight of a bullet is deflected by striking some
object, it starts to wobble or become irregular in flight, a condition
called yaw.241  A bullet with yaw has a greater surface exposed to the
striking material or air, since the target or air is struck not only
by the nose of the bullet, its smallest striking surface, but also by
the bullet's sides.242
</p>

<p><b>Page 95</b>
</p>

<p>The ballistics experts learned the exact nature of the
Governor's wrist wound by examining Parkland Hospital records and
X-rays and conferring with Dr. Gregory.  The C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle found in the Depository was fired with bullets of the same type
as the bullet found on the Governor's stretcher and the fragments
found in the Presidential limousine.  Shots were fired from a distance
of 70 yards at comparable flesh and bone protected by material similar
to the clothing worn by the Governor.243  One of the test shots
wounded the comparable flesh and bone structure in virtually the same
place and from the same angle as the wound inflicted on Governor
Connally's wrist.  An X-ray and photograph of the simulated wrist
confirmed the similarity.244  The bullet which inflicted that injury
during the tests had a nose which was substantially flattened from
striking the material.245  The striking velocity at 70 yards of seven
shots fired during the tests averaged 1,858 feet per second; the
average exit velocity of five shots was 1,776 feet per second.246
</p>

<p>The conclusion that the Governor's wrist was not struck by a
pristine bullet was based upon the following: ( 1 ) greater damage was
inflicted on the test material than on the Governor's wrist; 247 (2)
the test material had a smaller entry wound and a larger exit wound,
characteristic of a pristine bullet, while the Governor's wrist had a
larger entry wound as compared with its exit wound, indicating a
bullet which was tumbling;248 (3) cloth was carried into the wrist
wound, which is characteristic of an irregular missile;249 (4) the
partial cutting of a radial nerve and tendon leading to the Governor's
thumb further suggested that the bullet which struck him was not
pristine, since such a bullet would merely push aside a tendon and
nerve rather than catch and tear them;250 (5) the bullet found on the
Governor's stretcher probably did not pass through the wrist as a
pristine bullet because its nose was not considerably flattened, as
was the case with the pristine bullet which struck the simulated
wrist;251 and (6) the bullet which caused the Governor's thigh injury
and then fell out of the wound had a "very low velocity," whereas the
pristine bullets fired during the tests possessed a very high exit
velocity.252
</p>

<p>All the evidence indicated that the bullet found on the
Governor's stretcher could have caused all his wounds.  The weight of
the whole bullet prior to firing was approximately 160-161 grains and
that of the recovered bullet was 158.6 grains.253  An X-ray of the
Governor's wrist showed very minute metallic fragments, and two or
three of these fragments were removed from his wrist.254  All these
fragments were sufficiently small and light so that the nearly whole
bullet found on the stretcher could have deposited those pieces of
metal as it tumbled through his wrist.255  In their testimony, the
three doctors who attended Governor Connally at Parkland Hospital
expressed independently their opinion that a single bullet had passed
through his chest; tumbled through his wrist with very little exit
velocity, leaving small metallic fragments from the rear portion of
the bullet; punctured his left thigh after the bullet had lost
virtually all of its velocity; and had fallen out of the thigh
wound.256
</p>

<p><b>Page 96</b>
</p>

<p>Governor Connally himself thought it likely that all his wounds
were caused by a single bullet.  In his testimony before the
Commission, he repositioned himself as he recalled his position on the
jump seat, with his right palm on his left thigh, and said:</p>
    <blockquote>I ... wound up the next day realizing I was hit in three places,
    and I was not conscious of having been hit but by one bullet, so I
    tried to reconstruct how I could have been hit in three places by the
    same bullet, and I merely, I know it penetrated from the back through
    the chest first.<br>
    I assumed that I had turned as I described a moment ago, placing
    my right hand on my left leg, that it hit my wrist, went out the
    center of the wrist, the underside, and then into my leg, but it might
    not have happened that way at all.257</blockquote>
	<p>
The Governor's posture explained how a single missile through his body
would cause all his wounds.  His doctors at Parkland Hospital had
recreated his position, also, but they placed his right arm somewhat
higher than his left thigh although in the same alinement.258 The
wound ballistics experts concurred in the opinion that a single bullet
caused all the Governor's wounds.259
</p>

<a name="trajectory"></a>

<p><b>THE TRAJECTORY</b></p>
<p>The cumulative evidence of eyewitnesses, firearms and ballistic
experts and medical authorities demonstrated that the shots were fired
from above and behind President Kennedy and Governor Connally, more
particularly, from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository
Building.  In order to determine the facts with as much precision as
possible and to insure that all data were consistent with the shots
having been fired from the sixth floor window, the Commission
requested additional investigation, including the analysis of motion
picture films of the assassination and onsite tests.  The facts
developed through this. investigation by the FBI and Secret Service
confirmed the conclusions reached by the Commission regarding the
source and trajectory of the shots which hit the President and the
Governor.  Moreover, these facts enabled the Commission to make
certain approximations regarding the locations of the Presidential
limousine at the time of the shots and the relevant time intervals.
 </p>
<a name="films"></a>
<p><b>Films and Tests</b>
</p>
<p>When the shots rang out the Presidential limousine was moving
beyond the Texas School Book Depository Building in a southwesterly
direction on Elm Street between Houston Street and the Triple
Underpass.260  The general location of the car was described and
marked on maps by eyewitnesses as precisely as their observations and
recollections permitted.261  More exact information was provided by
motion 
</p>
<p><b>Page 97</b>
</p>
<p>pictures taken by Abraham Zapruder, Orville O. Nix and Mary Muchmore,
who were spectators at the scene.262 Substantial light has been shed
on the assassination sequence by viewing these motion pictures,
particularly the Zapruder film, which was the most complete and from
which individual 35-millimeter slides were made of each motion picture
frame.263
</p>
<p>Examination of the Zapruder motion picture camera by the FBI
established that 18.3 pictures or frames were taken each second, and
therefore, the timing of certain events could be calculated by
allowing 1/18.3 seconds for the action depicted from one frame to the
next.264 The films and slides made from individual frames were viewed
by Governor and Mrs. Connally, the Governor's doctors, the autopsy
surgeons, and the Army wound ballistics scientists in order to apply
the knowledge of each to determine the precise course of events.265
Tests of the assassin's rifle disclosed that at least 2.8 seconds were
required between shots.266  In evaluating the films in the light of
these timing guides, it was kept in mind that a victim of a bullet
wound may not react immediately and, in some situations, according to
experts, the victim may not even know where he has been hit, or
when.267
</p>
<p>On May 24, 1964, agents of the FBI and Secret Service conducted a
series of tests to determine as precisely as possible what happened on
November 22, 1963.  Since the Presidential limousine was being
remodeled and was therefore unavailable, it was simulated by using the
Secret Service follow-up car, which is similar in design.268  Any
differences were taken into account.  Two Bureau agents with
approximately the same physical characteristics sat in the car in the
same relative positions as President Kennedy and Governor Connally had
occupied.  The back of the stand-in for the President was marked with
chalk at the point where the bullet entered.  The Governor's model had
on the same coat worn by Governor Connally when he was shot, with the
hole in the back circled in chalk.269
</p>
<p>
To simulate the conditions which existed at the assassination
scene on November 22, the lower part of the sixth-floor window at the
southeast corner of the Depository Building was raised halfway, the
cardboard boxes were repositioned, the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle
found on the sixth floor of the Depository was used, and mounted on
that rifle was a camera which recorded the view as was seen by the
assassin.270  In addition, the Zapruder, Nix, and Muchmore cameras
were on hand so that photographs taken by these cameras from the same
locations where they were used on November 22, 1963, could be compared
with the films of that date.271  The agents ascertained that the
foliage of an oak tree that came between the gunman and his target
along the motorcade route on Elm Street was approximately the same as
on the day of the assassination.272</p>

 <p></p>
 
 <a name="first"></a>
<p>
<b>The First Bullet that Hit</b></p>

 <p>The position of President Kennedy's car when he was struck in
the neck was determined with substantial precision from the films and 
</p>
<p><b>Page 98</b></p>
<p>onsite tests.  The pictures or frames in the Zapruder film were marked
by the agents, with the number "1" given to the first frame where the
motorcycles leading the motorcade came into view on Houston Street.273
The numbers continue in sequence as Zapruder filmed the Presidential
limousine as it came around the corner and proceeded down Elm. The
President was in clear view of the assassin as he rode up Houston
Street and for 100 feet as he proceeded down Elm Street, until he came
to a point denoted as frame 166 on the Zapruder film.274	These
facts were determined in the test by placing the car and men on Elm
Street in the exact spot where they were when each frame of the
Zapruder film was photographed.  To pinpoint their locations, a man
stood at Zapruder's position and directed the automobile and both
models to the positions shown on each frame, after which a Bureau
photographer crouched at the sixth-floor window and looked through a
camera whose lens recorded the view through the telescopic sight of
the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.275  (See Commission Exhibit No.
887, p. 99.)  Each position was measured to determine how far
President Kennedy had gone down Elm from a point, which was designated
as station C, on a line drawn along the west curbline of Houston
Street.276</p>
<p>Based on these calculations, the agents concluded that at frame
166 of the Zapruder film the President passed beneath the foliage of
the large oak tree and the point of impact on the President's back
disappeared from the gunman's view as seen through the telescopic
lens.277 (See Commission Exhibit No. 889, p. 100.)  For a fleeting
instant, the President came back into view in the telescopic lens at
frame 186 as he appeared in an opening among the leaves.278  (See
Commission Exhibit No. 891, p. 101.)  The test revealed that the next
point at which the rifleman had a clear view through the telescopic
sight of the point where the bullet entered the President's back was
when the car emerged from behind the tree at frame 210.279
(See Commission Exhibit No. 893, p. 102.)
According to FBI Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, "There is no obstruction
from the sixth floor window from the time they leave the tree until
they disappear down toward the triple overpass."
</p>
<p>As the President rode along Elm Street for a distance of about 140
feet, he was waving to the crowd.281  Shaneyfelt testified that the
waving is seen on the Zapruder movie until around frame 205, when road
sign blocked out most of the President's body from Zapruder's view
through the lens of his camera.  However, the assassin continued to
have a clear view of the President as he proceeded down Elm.282 When
President Kennedy again came fully into view in the Zapruder film at
frame 225, he seemed to be reacting to his neck wound by raising his
hands to his throat.283  (See Commission Exhibit No. 895, p. 103.)
According to Shaneyfelt the reaction was "clearly apparent in 226 and
barely apparent in 225."284 It is probable that the President was not
shot. before frame 210, since it is unlikely that the assassin would
deliberately have shot at him  with a view obstructed by the oak tree
when he was about to have a clear opportunity. It is</p>

<p><b>Page 105</b>
</p>

<p>also doubtful that even the most proficient marksman would have hit
him through the oak tree.  In addition, the President's reaction is
"barely apparent" in frame 225, which is 15 frames or approximately
eight-tenths second after frame 210, and a shot much before 210 would
assume a longer reaction time than was recalled by eyewitnesses at the
scene.  Thus, the evidence indicated that the President was not hit
until at least frame 210 and that he was probably hit by frame 225.
The possibility of variations in reaction time in addition to the
obstruction of Zapruder's view by the sign precluded a more specific
determination than that the President was probably shot through the
neck between frames 210 and 225, which marked his position between
138.9 and 153.8 feet west of station C.285
</p>

<p>According to Special Agent Robert A. Frazier, who occupied the
position of the assassin in the sixth-floor window during the
reenactment, it is likely that the bullet which passed through the
President's neck, as described previously, then struck the automobile
or someone else in the automobile.286  The minute examination by the
FBI inspection team, conducted in Washington between 14 and 16 hours
after the assassination, revealed no damage indicating that a bullet
struck any part of the interior of the Presidential limousine, with
the exception of the cracking of the windshield and the dent on the
windshield chrome.287 Neither of these points of damage to the car
could have been caused by the bullet which exited from the President's
neck at a velocity of 1,772 to 1,779 feet per second.288  If the
trajectory had permitted the bullet to strike the windshield, the
bullet would have penetrated it and traveled a substantial distance
down the road unless it struck some other object en route.289  Had
that bullet struck the metal framing, which was dented, it would have
torn a hole in the chrome and penetrated the framing, both inside and
outside the car.290 At that exit velocity, the bullet would have
penetrated any other metal or upholstery surface of the interior of
the automobile.291
</p>

<p>The bullet that hit President Kennedy in the back and exited
through his throat most likely could not have missed both the
automobile and its occupants.  Since it did not hit the automobile,
Frazier testified that it probably struck Governor Connally.292  The
relative positions of President Kennedy and Governor Connally at the
time when the President was struck in the neck confirm that the same
bullet probably passed through both men. Pictures taken of the
President's limousine on November 22, 1963, showed that the Governor
sat immediately in front of the President.293 Even though the precise
distance cannot be ascertained, it is apparent that President Kennedy
was somewhat to the Governor's right. The President sat on the extreme
right, as noted in the films and by eyewitnesses, while the right edge
of the jump seat in which the Governor sat is 6 inches from the right
door.294  (See Commission Exhibit No. 697 p. 104.)  The President wore
a back brace which tended to make him sit up straight, and the
Governor also sat erect since the jump seat gave him little leg
room.295
</p>

<p>Based on his observations during the reenactment and the
position of Governor Connally shown in the Zapruder film after the car
</p>

<p><b>Page 106</b> 
</p>

<p>emerged from behind the sign, Frazier testified that Governor Connally
was in a position during the span from frame 207 to frame 225 to
receive a bullet which would have caused the wounds he actually
suffered.296  Governor Connally viewed the film and testified that he
was hit between frames 231 and 234.297  According to Frazier, between
frames 235 and 240 the Governor turned sharply to his right, so that
by frame 240 he was too far to the right to have received his injuries
at that time.298  At some point between frames 235 and 240, therefore,
is the last occasion when Governor Connally could have received his
injuries, since in the frames following 240 he remained turned too far
to his right.299  If Governor Connally was hit by a separate shot
between frames 235 and 240 which followed the shot which hit the
President's neck, it would follow that: (1) the assassin's first shot,
assuming a minimum firing time of 2.3 seconds (or 42 frames), was
fired between frames 193 and 198 when his view was obscured by the oak
tree; (2) President Kennedy continued waving to the crowd after he was
hit and did not begin to react for about 1 1/2 seconds; and (3) the
first shot, although hitting no bones in the President's body, was
deflected after its exit from the President's neck in such a way that
it failed to hit either the automobile or any of the other occupants.
</p>

<p>Viewed through the telescopic sight of the C2766
Mannlicher-Carcano rifle from the sixth-floor window during the test,
the marks that simulated the entry wounds on the stand-ins for the
President and the Governor were generally in a straight line. That
alinement became obvious to the viewer through the scope as the
Governor's model turned slightly to his right and assumed the position
which Governor Connally had described as his position when he was
struck.  Viewing the stand-ins for the President and the Governor in
the sight of the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle at the location
depicted in frames 207 and 210, Frazier testified: "They both are in
direct alinement with the telescopic sight at the window. The Governor
is immediately behind the President in the field of view."300  (See
Commission Exhibit No. 893, p. 102.)  A surveyor then placed his
sighting equipment at the precise point of entry on the back of the
President's neck, assuming that the President was struck at frame 210,
and measured the angle to the end of the muzzle of the rifle
positioned where it was believed to have been held by the assassin.301
That angle measured 21&deg;34'.302 From the same points of reference, the
angle at frame 225 was measured at 20&deg;11, giving an average angle of
20&deg;52'30'' from frame 210 to frame 225.303  Allowing for a downward
street grade of 309', the probable angle through the President's body
was calculated at 17&deg;43'30'', assuming that he was sitting in a
vertical position.304
</p>

<p>That angle was consistent with the trajectory of a bullet
passing through the President's neck and then striking Governor
Connally's back, causing the wounds which were discussed above.
Shortly after that angle was ascertained, the open car and the
stand-ins were taken by the agents to a nearby garage where a
photograph was taken to determine through closer study whether the
angle of that shot could have accounted for the wounds in the
President's neck and the Governor's 
</p>

<p><b>Page 107</b>  
</p>

<p>back.305  A rod was placed at an angle of 17&ordm;43'30" next to the
stand-ins for the President and the Governor, who were seated in the
same relative positions.306 The wounds of entry and exit on the
President were approximated based on information gained from the
autopsy reports and photographs.307 The hole in the back of the jacket
worn by the Governor and the medical description of the wound on his
back marked that entry point.308 That line of fire from the sixth
floor of the Depository would have caused the bullet to exit under the
Governor's right nipple just as the bullet did.  Governor Connally's
doctors measured an angle of declination on his body from the entry
wound on his hack to the exit on the front of his chest at about
25&deg;when he sat erect.309  That difference was explained by either a
slight deflection of the bullet caused by striking the fifth rib or
the Governor's leaning slightly backward at the time he was struck.
In addition, the angle could not be fixed with absolute precision,
since the large wound on the front of his chest precluded an exact
determination of the point of exit.310
</p>

<p>The alinement of the points of entry was only indicative and
not conclusive that one bullet hit both men.  The exact positions of
the men could not be re-created; thus, the angle could only be
approximated.311 Had President Kennedy been leaning forward or
backward, the angle of declination of the shot to a perpendicular
target would have varied.  The angle of 17&ordm;43'30" was approximately
the angle of declination reproduced in an artist's drawing.312  That
drawing, made from data provided by the autopsy surgeons, could not
reproduce the exact line of the bullet, since the exit wound was
obliterated by the tracheotomy.  Similarly, if the President or the
Governor had been sitting in a different lateral position, the
conclusion might have varied.  Or if the Governor had not turned in
exactly the way calculated, the alinement would have been destroyed.
</p>

<p>Additional experiments by the Army Wound Ballistics Branch
further suggested that the same bullet probably passed through both
President Kennedy and Governor Connally.   (See app. X, pp. 582-585. )
 Correlation of a test simulating the Governor's chest wound with the
neck and wrist experiments.' indicated that course. After reviewing
the Parkland Hospital medical records and X-rays of the Governor and
discussing his chest injury with the attending surgeon, the Army
ballistics experts virtually duplicated the wound using the
assassination weapon and animal flesh covered by cloth.313 The bullet
that struck the animal flesh displayed characteristics similar to the
bullet found on Governor Connally's stretcher.314  Moreover, the
imprint on the velocity screen immediately behind the animal flesh
showed that the bullet was tumbling after exiting from the flesh,
having lost a total average of 265 feet per second.315  Taking into
consideration the Governor's size, the reduction in velocity of a
bullet passing through his body would be approximately 400 feet per
second.316
</p>

<p>Based upon the medical evidence on the wounds of the Governor
and the President and the wound ballistics tests performed at Edgewood

</p>

<p>Arsenal, Drs. Olivier and Arthur J. Dziemian, chief of the Army Wound
Ballistics Branch, who had spent 17 years in that area of
specialization, concluded that it was probable that the same bullet
passed through the President's neck and then inflicted all the wounds
on the Governor.317  Referring to the President's neck wound and all
the Governor's wounds, Dr. Dziemian testified: "I think the
probability is very good that it is, that all the wounds were caused
by one bullet."318  Both Drs. Dziemian and Olivier believed that the
wound on the Governor's wrist would have been more extensive had the
bullet which inflicted that injury merely passed through the
Governor's chest, exiting at a velocity of approximately 1,500 feet
per second.319 Thus, the Governor's wrist wound suggested that the
bullet passed through the President's neck, began to yaw in the air
between the President and the Governor, and then lost more velocity
than 400 feet per second in passing through the Governor's chest.  A
bullet which was yawing on entering into the Governor's back would
lose substantially more velocity in passing through his body than a
pristine bullet.320  In addition, the bullet that struck the animal
flesh was flattened to a greater extent than the bullet which
presumably struck the Governor's rib,321 which suggests that the
bullet which entered the Governor's chest had already lost velocity by
passing through the President's neck. Moreover, the large wound on the
Governor's back would be explained by a bullet which was yawing,
although that type of wound might also be accounted for by a
tangential striking.322
</p>

<p>Dr. Frederick W. Light, Jr., the third of the wound ballistics
experts, who. has been engaged in that specialty at Edgewood Arsenal
since 1951, testified that the anatomical findings were insufficient
for him to formulate a firm opinion as to whether the same bullet did
or did not pass through the President's neck first before inflicting
all the wounds on Governor Connally.323  Based on the other
circumstances, such as the relative positions of the President and the
Governor in the automobile, Dr. Light concluded that it was probable
that the same bullet traversed the President's neck and inflicted all
the wounds on Governor Connally.324

<p><b>The Subsequent Bullet That Hit</b></p>
<p>
 After a bullet penetrated President Kennedy's neck, a subsequent
shot entered the back of his head and exited through the upper right
portion of his skull.  The Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore films show the
instant in the sequence when that bullet struck.  ( See Commission
Exhibit No. 902, p. 108.)  That impact was evident from the explosion
of the President's brain tissues from the right side of his head. The
immediately preceding frame from the Zapruder film shows the President
slumped to his left, clutching at his throat, with his chin close to
his chest and his head tilted forward at an angle.325  Based upon
information provided by the doctors who conducted the autopsy, an
artist's drawing depicted the path of the bullet through the
President's head, with his head being in the same approximate
position.326</p>
<p><b>Page 110</b></p>
<p>
 By using the Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore motion pictures,
the President's location at the time the bullet penetrated his head
was fixed with reasonable precision. A careful analysis of the Nix and
Muchmore films led to fixing the exact location of these cameramen.
The point of impact of the bullet on the President's head was apparent
in all of the movies.  At that point in the Nix film a straight line
was plotted from the camera position to a fixed point in the
background and the President's location along this line was marked on
a plat map.327 A similar process was followed with the Muchmore film.
The President's location on the plat map was identical to that
determined from the Nix film.328 The President's location, established
through the Nix and Muchmore films, was confirmed by comparing his
position on the Zapruder film.  This location had hitherto only been
approximated, since there were no landmarks in the background of the
Zapruder frame for alinement purposes other than a portion of a
painted line on the curb.329 Through these procedures, it was
determined that President Kennedy was shot in the head when he was
230.8 feet from a point on the west curbline on Houston Street where
it intersected with Elm Street.330 The President was 265.3 feet from
the rifle in the sixth-floor window and at that position the
approximate angle of declination was 15&deg;21'.331</p>

<a name="number"></a>

<p></p>

<p><b>NUMBER OF SHOTS</b></p>
 

<p>The consensus among the witnesses at the scene was that three
shots were fired.332  However, some heard only two shots,333 while
others testified that they heard four and perhaps as many as five or
six shots.334  The difficulty of accurate perception of the sound of
gunshots required careful scrutiny of all of this testimony regarding
the number of shots.  The firing of a bullet causes a number of
noises: the muzzle blast, caused by the smashing of the hot gases
which propel the bullet into the relatively stable air at the gun's
muzzle; the noise of the bullet, caused by the shock wave built up
ahead of the bullet's nose as it travels through the air; and the
noise caused by the impact of the bullet on its target.335  Each noise
can be quite sharp and may be perceived as a separate shot.  The tall
buildings in the area might have further distorted the sound.
</p>

<p>The physical and other evidence examined by the Commission
compels the conclusion that at least two shots were fired.  As
discussed previously, the nearly whole bullet discovered at Parkland
Hospital and the two larger fragments found in the Presidential
automobile, which were identified as coming from the assassination
rifle, came from at least two separate bullets and possibly from
three.336  The most convincing evidence relating to the number of
shots was provided by the presence on the sixth floor of three spent
cartridges which were demonstrated to have been fired by the same
rifle that fired the bullets which caused the wounds.  It is possible
that the assassin carried an empty shell in the rifle and fired only
two shots, with the witnesses hearing multiple noises made by the same
shot.  Soon after the three
</p>

<p><b>Page 111</b> 
</p>

<p>empty cartridges were found, officials at the scene decided that three
shots were fired, and that conclusion was widely circulated by the
press.  The eyewitness testimony may be subconsciously colored by the
extensive publicity given the conclusion that three shots were fired.
Nevertheless, the preponderance of the evidence, in particular the
three spent cartridges, led the Commission to conclude that there were
three shots fired.
</p>

<p><a href="chapter-3.html#top" name="missed">Return to Top</a></p>

<p><b>THE SHOT THAT MISSED</b>
</p>

<p>From the initial findings that (a) one shot passed through the
President's neck and then most probably passed through the Governor's
body, (b) a subsequent shot penetrated the President's head, (c) no
other shot struck any part of the automobile, and (d) three shots were
fired, it follows that one shot probably missed the car and its
occupants.  The evidence is inconclusive as to whether it was the
first, second, or third shot which missed.
</p>

<p><a href="chapter-3.html#top" name="firstmissed">Return to Top</a></p>

<p><b>The First Shot</b>
</p>

<p>If the first shot missed, the assassin perhaps missed in an effort
to fire a hurried shot before the President passed under the oak tree,
or possibly he fired as the President passed under the tree and the
tree obstructed his view.  The bullet might have struck a portion of
the tree and been completely deflected.  On the other hand, the
greatest cause for doubt that the first shot missed is the
improbability that the same marksman who twice hit a moving target
would be so inaccurate on the first and closest of his shots as to
miss completely, not only the target, but the large automobile.
</p>

<p>Some support for the contention that the first shot missed is
found in the statement of Secret Service Agent Glen A. Bennett,
stationed in the right rear seat of the President's follow-up car, who
heard a sound like a firecracker as the motorcade proceeded down Elm
Street.  At that moment, Agent Bennett stated:</p>

    <blockquote>... I looked at the back of the President.  I heard another
    firecracker noise and saw that shot hit the President about four
    inches down from the right shoulder.  A second shot followed
    immediately and hit the right rear high of the President's head.337</blockquote>
	<p>
Substantial weight may be given Bennett's observations.  Although his
formal statement was dated November 23, 1963, his notes indicate that
he recorded what he saw and heard at 5:30 p.m., November 1963, on the
airplane en route back to Washington, prior to the autopsy, when it
was not yet known that the President had been hit in the back.338 It
is possible, of course, that Bennett did not observe the hole in the
President's back, which might have been there immediately after the
first noise.
</p>

<p><b>Page 112</b>
</p>

<p>Governor Connally's testimony supports the view that the first
shot missed, because he stated that he heard a shot, turned slightly
to his right, and, as he started to turn back toward his left, was
struck by the second bullet.339 He never saw the President during the
shooting sequence, and it is entirely possible that he heard the
missed shot and that both men were struck by the second bullet.  Mrs.
Connally testified that after the first shot she turned and saw the
President's hands moving toward his throat, as seen in the films at
frame 225.340 However, Mrs. Connally further stated that she thought
her husband was hit immediately thereafter by the second bullet.341
If the same bullet struck both the President and the Governor, it is
entirely possible that she saw the President's movements at the same
time as she heard the second shot. Her testimony, therefore, does not
preclude the possibility of the first shot having missed.
</p>

<p>Other eyewitness testimony, however, supports the conclusion
that the first of the shots fired hit the President. As discussed in
chapter II, Special Agent Hill's testimony indicates that the
President was hit by the first shot and that the head injury was
caused by a second shot which followed about 5 seconds later.  James
W. Altgens, a photographer in Dallas for the Associated Press, had
stationed himself on Elm Street opposite the Depository to take
pictures of the passing motorcade.  Altgens took a widely circulated
photograph which showed President Kennedy reacting to the first of the
two shots which hit him.  (See Commission Exhibit No. 900, p. 113.)
According to Altgens, he snapped the picture "almost simultaneously"
with a shot which he is confident was the first one fired.342
Comparison of his photograph with the Zapruder film, however, revealed
that Altgens took his picture at approximately the same moment as
frame 255 of the movie, 30 to 45 frames (approximately 2 seconds)
later than the point at which the President was shot in the neck.343
(See Commission Exhibit No. 901, p. 114.)  Another photographer,
Phillip L. Willis, snapped a picture at a time which he also asserts
was simultaneous with the first shot. Analysis of his photograph
revealed that it was taken at approximately frame 210 of the Zapruder
film, which was the approximate time of the shot that probably hit the
President and the Governor.  If Willis accurately recalled that there
were no previous shots, this would be strong evidence that the first
shot did not miss.344
</p>

<p>If the first shot did not miss, there must be an explanation
for Governor Connally's recollection that he was not hit by it.  There
was, conceivably, a delayed reaction between the time the bullet
struck him and the time he realized that he was hit, despite the fact
that the bullet struck a glancing blow to a rib and penetrated his
wrist bone.  The Governor did not even know that he had been struck in
the wrist or in the thigh until he regained consciousness in the
hospital the next day.  Moreover, he testified that he did not hear
what he thought was the second shot, although he did hear a subsequent
shot which coincided with the shattering of the President's head.345
One possibility, therefore, would be a sequence in which the Governor
heard the first shot, did not immediately feel the penetration of the
bullet, 
</p>

<p><b>Page 113</b>

</p>

<p>then felt the delayed reaction of the impact on his back, later heard
the shot which shattered the President's head, and then lost
consciousness without hearing a third shot which might have occurred
later.
</p>

 

<a name="secondmissed"> </a>

<p><b>The Second Shot</b></p>
<p>The possibility that the second shot missed is consistent with the
elapsed time between the two shots that hit their mark.  From the
timing evidenced by the Zapruder films, there was an interval of from
4.8 to 5.6 seconds between the shot which struck President Kennedy's
neck (between frames 210 to 225) and the shot which struck his head at
frame 813.346  Since a minimum of 2.3 seconds must elapse between
shots, a bullet could have been fired from the rifle and missed during
this interval.347 This possibility was buttressed by the testimony of
witnesses who claimed that the shots were evenly spaced, since a
second shot occurring within an interval of approximately 5 seconds
would have to be almost exactly midway in this period.  If Altgens'
recollection is correct that he snapped his picture at the same moment
as he heard a shot, then it is possible that he heard a second shot
which missed, since a shot fired 2.3 seconds before he took his
picture at frame 255 could have hit the President at about frame 213.
On the other hand, a substantial majority of the witnesses stated that
the shots were not evenly spaced.  Most witnesses recalled that the
second and third shots were bunched together, although some believed
that it was the first and second which were bunched.348 To the extent
that reliance can be placed on recollection of witnesses as to the
spacing of the shots, the testimony that the shots were not evenly
spaced would militate against a second shot missing. Another factor
arguing against the second shot missing is that the gunman would have
been shooting at very near the minimum allowable time to have fired
the three shots within 4.8 to 5.6 seconds, although it was entirely
possible for him to have done so.  (See ch. IV, pp. 188-194.)</p>
 <a name="thirdmissed"> </a>
<p></p>


<p><b>The Third Shot</b></p>
 

<p>The last possibility, of course, is that it was the third shot
which missed.  This conclusion conforms most easily with the
probability that the assassin would most likely have missed the
farthest shot, particularly since there was an acceleration of the
automobile after the shot which struck the President's head.  The
limousine also changed direction by following the curve to the right,
whereas previously it had been proceeding in almost a straight line
with a rifle protruding from the sixth-floor window of the Depository
Building.
</p>

<p>One must consider, however, the testimony of the witnesses who
described the head shot as the concluding event in the assassination
sequence.  Illustrative is the testimony of Associated Press
photographer Altgens, who had an excellent vantage point near the
President's car. He recalled that the shot which hit the President's
head "was the last shot--that much I will say with a great degree </p>
<p><b>Page 116</b></p>
<p>
 of certainty."349 On the other hand, Emmett J. Hudson, the
grounds-keeper of Dealey Plaza, testified that from his position on
Elm Street, midway between Houston Street and the Triple Underpass, he
heard a third shot after the shot which hit the President in the
head.350  In addition, Mrs. Kennedy's testimony indicated that neither
the first nor the second shot missed.  Immediately after the first
noise she turned, because of the Governor's yell, and saw her husband
raise his hand to his forehead.  Then the second shot struck the
President's head.351</p>
<p>Some evidence suggested that a third shot may have entirely missed
and hit the turf or street by the Triple Underpass.  Royce G. Skelton,
who watched the motorcade from the railroad bridge., testified that
after two shots "the car came on down close to the Triple Underpass"
and an additional shot "hit in the left front of the President's car
on the cement."352 Skelton thought that there had been a total of four
shots, either the third or fourth of which hit in the vicinity of the
underpass.353  Dallas Patrolman J. W. Foster, who was also on the
Triple Underpass, testified that a shot hit the turf near a manhole
cover in the vicinity of the underpass.354 Examination of this area,
however, disclosed no indication that a bullet struck at the locations
indicated by Skelton or Foster.355</p>
<p>
 At a different location in Dealey Plaza, the evidence indicated
that a bullet fragment did hit the street.  James T. Tague, who got
out of his car to watch the motorcade from a position between Commerce
and Main Streets near the Triple Underpass, was hit on the cheek by an
object during the shooting.356  Within a few minutes Tague reported
this to Deputy Sheriff Eddy R. Walthers, who was examining the area to
see if any bullets had struck the turf.357  Walthers immediately
started to search where Tague had been standing and located a place on
the south curb of Main Street where it appeared a bullet had hit the
cement.358  According to Tague, "There was a mark quite obviously
that was a bullet, and it was very fresh."359 In Tague's opinion, it
was the second shot which caused the mark, since he thinks he heard
the third shot after he was hit in the face.360  This incident appears
to have been recorded in the contemporaneous report of Dallas
Patrolman L. L. Hill, who radioed in around 12:40 p.m.: "I have one
guy that was possibly hit by a richochet from the bullet off the
concrete."361 Scientific examination of the mark on the south curb of
Main Street by FBI experts disclosed metal smears which, "were
spectrographically determined to be essentially lead with a trace of
antimony."362  The mark on the curb could have originated from the
lead core of a bullet but the absence of copper precluded "the
possibility that the mark on the curbing section was made by an
unmutilated military full metal-jacketed bullet such as the bullet
from Governor Connally's stretcher."363</p>

<p>It is true that the noise of a subsequent shot might have been
drowned out by the siren on the Secret Service follow-up car
immediately after the head shot, or the dramatic effect of the head
shot might have caused so much confusion that the memory of subsequent
events was blurred.  </p>
<p><b>Page 117</b></p>
<p>
 Nevertheless, the preponderance of the eyewitness testimony that the
head shot was the final shot must be weighed in any determination as
to whether it was the third shot that missed. Even if it were caused
by a bullet fragment, the mark on the south curb of Main Street cannot
be identified conclusively with any of the three shots fired. Under
the circumstances it might have come from the bullet which hit the
President's head, or it might have been a product of the fragmentation
of the missed shot upon hitting some other object in the area.364
Since he did not observe any of the shots striking the President,
Tague's testimony that the second shot, rather than the third, caused
the scratch on his cheek, does not assist in limiting the
possibilities.</p>
<p>The wide range of possibilities and the existence of conflicting
testimony, when coupled with the impossibility of scientific
verification, precludes a conclusive finding by the Commission as to
which shot missed.</p>
<p></p>

 <a name="timespan"> </a> 
<p><b>TIME SPAN OF SHOTS</b></p>
<p>Witnesses at the assassination scene said that the shots were
fired within a few seconds, with the general estimate being 5 to 6
seconds.365 That approximation was most probably based on the earlier
publicized reports that the first shot struck the President in the
neck, the second wounded the Governor and the third shattered the
President's head, with the time span from the neck to the head shots
on the President being approximately 5 seconds.  As previously
indicated, the time span between the shot entering the back of the
President's neck and the bullet which shattered his skull was 4.8 to
5.6 seconds. If the second shot missed, then 4.8 to 5.6 seconds was
the total time span of the shots. If either the first or third shots
missed, then a minimum of 2.3 seconds (necessary to operate the rifle)
must be added to the time span of the shots which hit, giving a
minimum time of 7.1 to 7.9 seconds for the three shots.  If more than
2.3 seconds elapsed between a shot that missed and one that hit, then
the time span would be correspondingly increased.</p>
 <a name="conclusion"> </a>

<p></p>


<p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p>Based on the evidence analyzed in this chapter, the Commission has
concluded that the shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded
Governor Connally were fired from the sixth-floor window at the
southeast corner of the Texas School Book Depository Building.  Two
bullets probably caused all the wounds suffered by President Kennedy
and Governor Connally.  Since the preponderance of the evidence
indicated that three shots were fired, the Commission concluded that
one shot probably missed the Presidential limousine and its occupants,
and that the three shots were fired in a time period ranging from
approximately 4.8 to in excess of 7 seconds.</p>
