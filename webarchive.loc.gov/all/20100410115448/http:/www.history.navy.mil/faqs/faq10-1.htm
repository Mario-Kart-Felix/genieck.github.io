NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Photograph of George Bush as a pilot">Upon
hearing of the Pearl Harbor attack, while a student at Phillips
Academy in Andover, Mass., George Bush decided he wanted to join
the Navy to become an aviator. Six months later, after graduation,
he enlisted in the Navy on his 18th birthday and began preflight
training at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After
completing the 10-month course, he was commissioned as an ensign
in the U.S. Naval Reserve on 9 June 1943, several days before
his 19th birthday; making him the youngest naval aviator then.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<DD>After finishing flight training, he was assigned to Torpedo
Squadron (VT-51) as photographic officer in September 1943. As
part of Air Group 51, his squadron was based on <I>USS San Jacinto</I>
in the spring of 1944. <I>San Jacinto</I> was part of Task Force
58 that participated in operations against Marcus and Wake Islands
in May, and then in the Marianas during June. On 19 June, the
task force triumphed in one of the largest air battles of the
war. During the return of his aircraft from the mission, Ensign
Bush's aircraft made a forced water landing. The destroyer, <I>USS
Clarence K. Bronson</I>, rescued the crew, but the plane was lost.
On 25 July, Ensign Bush and another pilot received credit for
sinking a small cargo ship. <BR>
<BR>
<DD>After Bush was promoted to Lieutenant Junior Grade on 1 August,
<I>San Jacinto</I> commenced operations against the Japanese in
the Bonin Islands. On 2 September 1944, Bush piloted one of four
aircraft from VT-51 that attacked the Japanese installations on
Chi Chi Jima. For this mission his crew included Radioman Second
Class John Delaney, and Lieutenant Junior Grade William White,
USNR, who substituted for Bush's regular gunner. During their
attack, four TBM Avengers from VT-51 encountered intense antiaircraft
fire. While starting the attack, Bush's aircraft was hit and his
engine caught on fire. He completed his attack and released the
bombs over his target scoring several damaging hits. With his
engine on fire, Bush flew several miles from the island, where
he and one other crew member on the TBM Avenger bailed out of
the aircraft. However, the other man's chute did not open and
he fell to his death. It was never determined which man bailed
out with Bush. Both Delaney and White were killed in action. While
Bush anxiously waited four hours in his inflated raft, several
fighters circled protectively overhead until he was rescued by
the lifeguard submarine, <I>USS Finback</I>. For this action,
Bush received the <A HREF="http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100410115448/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq10-2.htm">Distinguished Flying Cross.</A>
During the month he remained on <I>Finback</I>, Bush participated
in the rescue of other pilots. <BR>
<BR>
<DD>Subsequently, Bush returned to <I>San Jacinto</I> in November
1944 and participated in operations in the Philippines. When <I>San
Jacinto </I>returned to Guam, the squadron, which had suffered
50 percent casualties of its pilots, was replaced and sent to
the United States. Throughout 1944, he had flown 58 combat missions
for which he received the Distinguished Flying Cross, three Air
Medals, and the Presidential Unit Citation awarded <I>San Jacinto</I>.
<BR>
<BR>
<DD>Because of his valuable combat experience, Bush was reassigned
to Norfolk and put in a training wing for new torpedo pilots.
Later, he was assigned as a naval aviator in a new torpedo squadron,
VT-153. With the surrender of Japan, he was honorably discharged
in September 1945 and then entered Yale University. <BR>
