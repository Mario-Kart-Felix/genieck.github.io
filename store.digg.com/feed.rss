        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>You've probably heard about Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. It's a common condition that causes pain, numbness and tingling in the hand and arms. Though it's caused by several risk factors, you'll probably find yourself guilty in one: heavy use of computer mouse and awkward working postures of the hand and wrist. That is why this Sinji Vertical Ergonomic Mouse has a patented shape that supports the hand in an upright neutral position so that the rotation in the lower arm is reduced, and the arm is more relaxed. The mouse supports the hand well, which prevents pain and damage when working at the computer for long stretches of time. It also has a light-emitting edge which helps you work in low light.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>The molcajete is a century-old mortar and pestle used by Mexican cooks. Its rough surface is made entirely of volcanic stone, ideal for grinding and releasing flavorful oils from vegetables and spices. Like cast-iron, your molcajete bowl can go in the oven, retain heat for an hour, and it picks up flavors over time, continually enhancing the foods youâre working with. Perfect for salsa, guacamole, queso, mole, and more.
<br><br>
Each molcajete is packed in a tortilla basket made of handwoven palm leaves. Each one is unique in color and pattern. You can use the basket for corn chips, or tortillas.

</p>
<p><b>Recommended Curing Process Before First Use</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Rinse the molcajete with water (or let soak in water overnight), then clean with a wire brush, or toothbrush, to get rid of surface debris and dust
</li>
<li>Place enough rice to make an even layer across the bottom of the molcajete
</li>
<li>Pour in about a tablespoon of water, then use the pestle to work the rice up and around the entire inner surface of the molcajete until the rice has formed a grey paste
</li>
<li>Rinse out the paste, and repeat the rice grinding until the resulting paste is no longer grey
</li>
<li>You can then repeat with garlic, onion, cumin seeds, rock salt, or cilantro to add a seasoned flavor before your first use</li>
</ol>

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>No one wants the bulky and tangled chargers anymore...and if all the power we need can be put in a little device, we'd take it. Right? This Smart Keychain replaces the typical charging cable and uses the microcomputer electronic system to wirelessly charge the touch-sensitive Apple Watch by simply placing the watch on a black magnetic charger. It's easy to use. The strong magnetic adsorption allows you to adjust the angle freely without deviating from the charger center. This charger with a built-in 950mAh lithium-ion battery can charge all iWatch series. Portable, pocket-size when you're outdoors, the pocket size of the portable charger will be carried around and it's easy to put in your pocket and bag while you're exercising.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>Most machines on the market today are violent, inexpensive, and have wonderful website touting terms such as "G-Force", "Level 1, 2, and 3 Machines", and more. Not only that, the acceleration magnitudes used in some whole-body vibration machines can also be as high as 17.4 or even 22.0g which is well beyond the limits recommended for human tolerance by ISO 2631 and OSHA standards, and can be considered dangerous to use, especially for the elderly or young. 
<br><br>
VBX Pro distributes Oscillating Vibration Technology, which is the safest form of vibration. Whether youâre physically fit or a non-exerciser, overweight, suffering from stiffness, aches, and pains or recovering from an injury, almost anyone can enjoy the benefits of this machine. It generally improves overall heart rate, reduces cellulite, tones muscles, improves flexibility, increases bone density, reduces pain, and a lot more! From NASA to professional sports teams to chiropractors and physiotherapists, Whole Body Vibration has been accepted and is being employed throughout the world. Its proven benefits are detailed in medical journals.
<br><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Hundreds of muscle contractions per minute create an effective workout to tone muscles</li>
<li>Increasing lean muscle mass makes the body more fuel-efficient by burning more calories throughout the entire day</li>
<li>Causes your muscles to react to imbalance, strengthening muscles while increasing flexibility in muscles, joints, and ligaments</li>
<li>Toning muscles and increased lymphatic drainage can help fight off cellulite</li>
<li>Tighter muscles and an increased circulation can help to tighten the skin</li>
<li>Helps to cleanse toxic buildup from the body and increase oxygenation in the blood</li>
<li>Increased circulation, lymphatic drainage, and increased muscle strength may alleviate symptoms of fibromyalgia, arthritis, and other pain</li>
<li>Elevated levels of HGH can help the body heal and repair after injury or surgery</li>

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>One of the leading complaints about VPN services is that they slow your browsing experience to a crawl. HideMyAss, however, gives you a high-speed browsing experience while allowing you to access servers in over 190 countries. With such comprehensive coverage, thereâs hardly any content you wonât be able to access, and no block that can get in your way. HMA uses only the highest encryption standard: 256-bit AES, shielding your every connection and Strict No Logging Policy. It also strips away everything that makes you unique and identifiable online, hiding your IP address and encrypting your data to keep your browsing history private. With Lightning Connect, HMA allows you to browse from any location with the fastest connection available. Make fast connections with the largest VPN service on Earth.
<br><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited installs w/ up to 5 connections at once</li>
<li>Kill Switch makes sure no data leaks when your connection to a VPN server drop</li>
<li>Split-Tunneling allows you to choose which applications go through the VPN</li>
<li> IP Shuffle randomizes your IP addresses anywhere from every 10 minutes to once a day</li>
<li>No log HMA DNS servers to handle all your DNS requests, which keeps you private &amp; encrypted</li>
<li>Choose whether wired, Wi-Fi or mobile networks trigger the VPN to start automatically â and which networks to trust &amp; ignore</li>
<li>Servers in 290 locations spread across 190 countries</li>
<li>Special P2P servers mask your IP address while keeping any impact on your speeds at a minimum</li>
<li>Lightning Connect finds the fastest available server in a location for you automatically</li>
<li>All core data centers have servers capable of 20 Gbps throughput &amp; most other locations have servers w/ 10 Gbps throughput</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Strict No Logging Policy!</b></p>

<p><b><i>Reviews</i></b></p>

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>Agile is an iterative time-boxed software development approach that focuses on building software incrementally from the beginning of a project rather than delivering it all at once at the end. Scrum is a framework that traces the back to the early 90s, which provides a framework for managing complex product and software development with iterative and incremental processes. Scrum is a very popular framework for implementing agile project management. Both of these frameworks will be discussed in this class. If you want to understand what Scrum is and how it will benefit your projects, this is the right course for you.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>CashNotify is designed for entrepreneurs who earn their living online: founders, freelancers, bootstrappers, consultants, digital nomads â any small business that gets money via Stripe or PayPal. If you value your time and money, and can not spend your day in Stripe or PayPalâs dashboard, then itâs been designed for you. No more logging into your browser or loading that (otherwise nice) dashboard. With CashNotify, you'll receive alerts for successful and failed charges in your Notification Center â and, because it's always running in the background, you'll never miss a thing, even when you're not checking. Native notifications will alert you as soon as a payment fails, so you can jump on it right away. Of course, you'll also be notified of successful payments, so you can celebrate. And, you can rest easy knowing all data comes straight from Stripe or PayPal to your desktop â no intermediate server is involved, keeping your payments secure. <i>Note: CashNotify 3 PRO supports <strong>multiple</strong> Stripe and PayPal accounts.</i></p>

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>Say no more to copy-pasting code that you donât understand. This course will guide you in creating simple, intermediate, and advanced REST APIs including authentication, deployments, caching, and much more. Put simply, a REST API is an application that accepts data from clients and returns data back. With the data, it can do many things. For example, a REST API we build in this course accepts text data from the client, processes it and stores it in a database, and then returns some data back so the client can show something to the user. Using Flask and popular extensions Flask-RESTful, Flask-JWT, and Flask-SQLAlchemy you'll dive right into developing complete, solid, production-ready REST APIs.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>The best way to make Mexican Hot Chocolate is with clay cookware. Passed down by the Aztecs, itâs still preferred for the unique flavor it lends to food. This handcrafted jug is made with ancient hand-molding techniques and is finished with new techniques to be both functional and decorative. The jug can be used directly over heat - just add milk and chocolate. Try it with the food of the Gods, Oaxacan chocolate and whisk until frothy with the molinillo. The pot can also be used to heat teas, soups, and coffee, or will help keep icy drinks like water and lemonade cool for longer. And can we talk about its triple functionality as a vase or decoration? Youâll be impressed.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>You can now actually make the famous Mexican Cantaritos cocktail with this kit: includes 2 terracota clay cups, hand juicer, paper straws, and chili salt. The clay cantaritos cups are traditionally meant to be refilled during the night at street fairs, but are usually treated as disposable. As a twist, this kit has cups that are finished with a special glaze to reinforce them. Made with terracota clay, these cups are perfect for maintaining a cocktailâs cold temperature, and the handmade nature evoked memories of generations worth of fun. With proper care the cups could last for some time, but are easily breakable and not dishwasher-safe.
<br><br>
</p>
<p><b><i>What is the Mexican Cantaritos Cocktail?</i></b></p>
Known by locals as âthe best way to drink tequila,â the jarritos de barro mexicanos cups inspired the Mexican Cantaritos cocktail. The Mexican Cantaritos cocktail is made by rimming the cup with lime juice and chili salt, squeezing fresh lemon, lime, and grapefruit juice in the cup, and adding a splash of tequila and grapefruit soda.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>The popularity of tequila and its sibling mezcal is skyrocketing â and people are experimenting with their own flavors and infusions. Traditionally, a mezcal tasting cup is a jicara or small cup made from the bark of the jicara fruit. But with INFUSE, the wide mouth of these 4 jicara cups allows the alcohol to evaporate, leaving room for the full expression of the mezcal. It also comes with a wide-top decanter so it's easy to add infusion ingredients.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>In language learning, there is a well-known hack or trick to pushing through early stages much quicker than the 'average' learner, and itâs to find the top 300 most used words or patterns in the language and to learn those first. That's what you'll actually find in this course. By focusing on the fundamental patterns of the arrangement, this course will help you arrange more fluently to become a better piano player. This is for musicians who already have a foundation in music theory and composition.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>Editing videos can be a time-consuming process, but LUTs can speed things up dramatically. Short for "Look Up Tables" LUTs save the RGB (red, green and blue) channels of a frame, which you can apply to other images or videos to change their RGB values, saving you a ton of time! In this course, you'll learn everything that's needed to create high-quality LUTs. You'll start with a simple introduction to Photoshop adjustment layers, then you'll dive into using a LUT generator to create advanced LUTs via adjustment layers and Camera Raw.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>There are two things about Photoshop you need to master to take your work to the next level: selections and masks. You use selections in most of the work in Photoshop. Do you need to cut out the object, make smooth edges, compose things into your image? You will more likely need selections to do such a task. On the other hand, if you want to change a background, you'll probably want to learn how to use masks. This course will show you basic tools to do simple tasks and then move on to more advanced concepts and techniques so you can work with shadows, highlights, contrasts, and more.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>This 1-hour course is a quick and high-level overview of Rust. Rust is a language suitable for systems programming, but unlike other low-level languages, Rust is "safe," meaning that the language itself protects against bugs that occur as a result of directly accessing memory. This safety, along with Rust's speed, makes it a great fit for teams working on embedded systems or time-critical tasks, and anyone who wants to learn more about systems programming in general.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>This 2-hour course will take you to the fundamentals of PhoneGap. In software development, PhoneGap is a mobile development framework created by Nitobi. It enables software programmers to build applications for mobile devices using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, instead of relying on platform-specific APIs like those in iOS, Windows Phone, or Android. It enables wrapping up of HTML, CSS and Javascript code depending upon the platform of the device. It extends the features of HTML and Javascript to work with the device. The resulting applications are hybrid, meaning that they are neither truly native mobile applications nor purely web-based.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>MacDroid is a friendly compact Android file transfer utility for macOS. As Mac and Android don't offer a native way to transfer and manage files between the two systems, there is a need for a glitch-free, convenient interface. MacDroid is exactly that! With MacDroid you can connect your Android phone or tablet to a Mac and transfer images, music, videos, as well as various entire folders between computer and mobile devices. One other thing you'll need is a USB cable, that's it. It is not only Android devices MacDroid works perfectly well with, but it also allows connecting any MTP devices to your Mac and accessing their content in the Finder as well as performing file transfer.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>With a mission to conserve the worldâs forests and bring attention to their continued destruction, Tentsile invented the Tree Tent concept. Tentsile UNA is a 1-person tree tent that offers a whole new level of versatility, comfort, and connection with the outdoors and is perfect for hikers and backpackers. Featuring a patented 3-point anchor system, waterproof rainfly, and insect mesh, this hammock will make you camp like never before. The setup time only takes an average of 10 minutes and offers the versatility to set up camp above water, on steep terrain, on uneven ground - all with a zero-footprint, the sky really is the only limit.
<br><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Patented 3-point anchor system pulls the floor of the tent while giving just enough flex to conform to &amp; cushion your body</li>
<li>Rainfly completely encloses the hammock tent &amp; is suitable for camping in all 4 seasons</li>
<li>280lb capacity designed for a single person, perfect for solo adventurers</li>
<li>Built-in no-see-um insect mesh protects you from insects while letting you enjoy a nice breeze</li>

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>Lil Wonder Petz â a Bluetooth Speaker collection that is miniature in size but big and loud on sound. These animal shapes make the speakers more enjoyable and lovable rather than a piece of electronics. Almost like having a buddy or a tune partner that has all the same music interest as much as you do! The crisp and loud sound from these little speakers has the sound that will fill up an entire room. It rivals the larger speakers and takes music listening to a whole new level. You can even buy any two-speakers from this group and pair them to play simultaneously, making the sound even louder and can be set apart by 100 ft to give the surround sound effect. If you ever get in a mood to snap pictures, this Lil Wonder can help you by acting as a remote shutter switch for the camera on your phone.</p>

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>Retouching photos is an essential skill for professional photographers, and is an exceptionally useful one for amateurs as well. The only non-destructive technique used in retouching is dodging and burning, and that's the technique you'll learn in this course. By manipulating the level of exposure to "clean" the skin and contour objects, dodging and burning can give portraits a more pronounced, beautiful look. Through this course, you'll master this prominent beauty magazine technique.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>Double-walled and vacuum insulated. That means all the air has been sucked out between the walls and there is nothing to transfer heat or cold to the inside. With the vacuum insulation, the outside environment has an extremely hard time affecting the interior of the bottle and vise versa. KOLD only uses BPA free, premium food grade 18/8 stainless steel...and that's on both walls, using 18/8 stainless steel helps to prevent odor absorption and rust. So choose your liquid of choice and you will always get the true flavor of your drink. The lids are leak-free. So feel confident in throwing your full bottle in your gym bag without your clothes getting wet, or using it as a paperweight in your office. This bottle also comes with 5 different colors of silicone sleeves.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>Lockets have always been a symbol of love and devotion, however, regular lockets are limited to one single photo memory. EvermÃ©e solves that little problem. This 18K Gold Vermeil Smart Locker uses Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to reveal a digital photo when the locket touches your phone via the EvermÃ©e app. Simply download the free app from iOS or Google Play and upload your selected photo memory. You can also change your memory through the app anytime you want. Aren't photos and memories personal? Yes! But don't worry, EvermÃ©e cannot see the photo memory you uploaded online. The upload process happens anonymously and the system automatically ties your photo to your gemstone. What's yours is yours!
<br><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload &amp; change a photo memory on the locket through the free mobile app</li>
<li>Activate the NFC on your phone (click <a style="color:blue"></a><a href="https://support.evermee.com/article/show/72477-how-can-i-activate-nfc-on-my-phone" target="_blank">here</a> for instructions)</li>
<li>Easily reveal photos by simply having your phone touch the gemstone</li>
<li>Keep your memories safe even after dropping the jewelry into water</li>
</ul>

<i>NOTE: We strongly advise you NOT to let water touch your jewelry, in order to avoid an oxidizing reaction of the silver that can result in stains.  </i>

CASA Hub i8 intelligently converts a USB Type-C port to a USB 3.1 Type-C port, two standard USB 3.1 Type-A ports, an HDMI video port, a pair of SD/microSD memory card readers, and a 48kHz/16-bit stereo earphone jack.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>The Chefman Indoor Grill produces less smoke than traditional indoor grills, so you can enjoy perfectly grilled food year-round without having to stand in the cold. To achieve that perfectly smoke-free grilling indoors, the drip tray must be filled with water between the minimum and maximum line. The water instantly cools the grease that falls on it, preventing it from sticking to the tray or from smoking. With an extra-large 15" inch cooking surface, you can cook multiple foods at the same time for a complete meal. It also features a cool-touch handle and overheat auto shut-off protection for added safety.

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><p>You can now ditch the hassle of rewriting and organizing your notes, thanks to the NEWYES Smart Pen Set. It combines the traditional writing way with digital experience. The set features the NEWYES Smart Pen which captures your notes in real-time and immediately transfers it to your device. It works well with the NEWYES dot paper and LCD writing pad which are printed with a unique pattern of tiny microdots. These tiny patterns work a lot like a GPS system for your pen, allowing it to capture everything you scribble on the paper or LCD pad. Not only that, you can also refresh your memory by recording voice to your notes and listening back with only a click of the note you took. Get NEWYES and easily scribble, record, and digitize. 
<br><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sync your writing using the pen, notebook &amp; LCD writing pad</li>
<li>Import handwriting into text using the app</li>
<li>Record your audio w/ the note</li>
<li>Memorize your thought quickly w/ the note video playback</li>
<li>Easily store notes offline w/ the built-in memory</li>
<li>Enjoy 8 hours of continuous writing without interruption</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Tips</b></p>
<ol>
<li>The pen does not know which notebook youâre writing in. You have to keep only the one you are writing in active and hide the other notebooks in the app.</li>
<li>The pen does not know whether you delete the image on the LCD pad or not, so you have to open a new page on the App to start your new writing.</li>
<li>When you write on the LCD pad, please use the plastic refill, NOT use the ink pen to write directly.</li>
