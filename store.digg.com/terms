        <ul>
          <li><p><span>Under the Insider Rewards program, credits are earned based on the United States dollar(s) spent (as applicable based on the exchange rate of the country of purchase) on products offered on the websites, applications, and platforms in the Network. Credits earned under the Insider Rewards Program are on a per order basis and are not applicable to be combined across multiple orders. To earn credits, orders must meet certain minimum purchase amounts to qualify. Some exclusions apply. Any applicable credits earned from the Insider Rewards program will be automatically applied to your account 30 days from your date of purchase.</span></p></li>
          <li><p><span>Under the Refer-A-Friend program, credits are earned for the first purchase made on each new account registered from a Referrer's unique referral link.

    <ol start="1" type="A">
      <li>
        <p style="display:inline"><span><strong>About the Subscription Product ("Subscription").</strong> In addition to selling Products on a one-off basis, we also make available Subscriptions that allow for the recurring use of Products provided by third party vendors over a set duration of time.</span></p>
        <p style="display:inline"><span>The Subscription can be accessed either via a Free Trial or through a Paid Subscription. The Free Trial gives you (free) full access to the products contained in the Subscription for a finite duration. The Paid Subscription is a fee-based program which gives you full access to the products within the Subscription. You will only have access to the Products contained in the Subscription while your Subscription is active and subsisting. You may have access to a Free Trial of the Paid Subscription made available to you during a promotional offer. You can become a subscriber to the Paid Subscription by purchasing a Subscription on the Network or when your Free Trial converts if not cancelled before the end of the Free Trial.</span></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2" type="A">
      <li>
        <p style="display:inline"><span><strong>Free Trials.</strong> We may offer trials of our Paid Subscription (Free Trial) for a specified period of time that provides full access to the Subscription without requiring payment. We may determine the eligibility for a Free Trial and withdraw or modify a Free Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.</span></p>
        <p style="display:inline"><span>The Free Trial will begin on the day you sign-up and checkout with the Subscription in your cart, not on the day you redeem/start using any Products contained in the Subscription. For most Free Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to begin the Free Trial. By providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Free Trial on a recurring monthly basis or annual basis depending on the type of Paid Subscription you select. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL.</span></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="3" type="A">
      <li>
        <p style="display:inline"><span><strong>Billing.</strong> We offer both a monthly and annual Paid Subscription plans. You may purchase a Paid Subscription by paying a fee in advance on a monthly or annual basis. We may change the price of a Paid Subscription, including recurring subscription fees from time to time and will communicate any price change to you in advance, and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Any price change will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the price change by continuing to utilize the Products after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price change, you have the right to reject the change by cancelling the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.</span></p>
        <p style="display:inline"><span>For monthly Paid Subscriptions, for each month that your Paid Subscription is active, you acknowledge and agree that we are authorized to charge the same credit card that was used for the initial subscription fee (Payment Method). For annual Paid Subscriptions, each year is paid for by an upfront payment that will automatically renew and you authorize us to continue to charge your Payment Method while the subscription is active.</span></p>

    </ol>
    <ol start="4" type="A">
      <li>
        <p style="display:inline"><span><strong>Renewals and Cancellation.</strong> Your subscription period will begin on the day you purchase a Paid Subscription or the day your Free Trial converts to a Paid Subscription. Monthly Paid Subscriptions purchased on the 31st of a given month will always be billed on the last day of each subsequent month.</span></p>
        <p style="display:inline"><span>Your Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect on the day after the last day of the current subscription period. YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE IT RENEWS IN ORDER TO AVOID THE BILLING OF THE RENEWAL SUBSCRIPTION FEE TO THE PAYMENT METHOD PROVIDED. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.</span></p>
        <p style="display:inline"><span>If you were given a promotional offer for a monthly or annual Paid Subscription, unless otherwise noted in the promotional offer, your Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the standard Subscription rate once the promotional offer stated term has ended. For example, if you redeem a promotional offer that discounts the first month of a monthly Paid Subscription to $1, at the end of the 1-month period your monthly rate would go to the then-current full monthly Paid Subscription rate. If you do not wish to convert to the then-current standard Subscription rate, you would need to cancel your Paid Subscription prior to the end of the promotional offer stated term.</span></p>
        <p style="display:inline"><span>You may cancel your Free Trial or Paid Subscription by going to the “Subscriptions” tab in your user account.</span></p>

StackCommerce may terminate or suspend your access to the Subscription at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use or non-compliance with the Agreement, non-payment, or if we withdraw Products from the Subscription (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).</span></p>
        <p style="display:inline"><span>If you or StackCommerce terminate the Subscription, or if StackCommerce suspends your access to the Subscription, you agree that StackCommerce shall have no liability or responsibility to you, and StackCommerce will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. You may cancel your Paid Subscription or Free Trial and terminate this agreement as laid out in section 12D. This section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.</span></p>
        <p style="display:inline"><span>Sections 2-11 and 13-34 herein, as well as any other sections of the Agreement that, either explicitly or by their nature, must remain in effect even after termination of the Subscription, shall survive termination.</span></p>
