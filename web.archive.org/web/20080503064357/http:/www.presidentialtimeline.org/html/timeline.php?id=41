<h2>Early Life and Career</h2>
<h3>June 12, 1924 - January 20, 1989</h3>
<p>Bush was born on June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts, to Prescott and Dorothy Walker Bush. On his 18th birthday, Bush graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He received his commission on June 9, 1943, becoming the youngest naval aviator of the time. During World War II (WWII), Bush flew torpedo bombers, completing 58 missions. On a run over Chichi Jima in 1944, his plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire. Bush bailed out and was rescued by a Navy submarine, but tragically, his two crew members were killed. For his service during WWII, Bush was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals.</p>

<p>On January 6, 1945, Bush married Barbara Pierce of Rye, New York. They had six children: George Walker, Pauline Robinson (Robin), John Ellis (Jeb), Neil Mallon, Marvin Pierce, and Dorothy (Doro) Walker. Robin died of leukemia in 1953.</p>

<p>After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Yale University in 1948 with a degree in economics, the Bushes moved to Texas, where George went into the oil exploration business. His career in politics and public service began in 1963, when he was elected chairman of the Harris County (Texas) Republican Party. Bush was elected in 1966 to the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas&#8217; Seventh District and served two terms. Following congressional service, he held several senior-level positions, including U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in China and Director of Central Intelligence. In 1980, Ronald Reagan selected George Bush as his running mate. On January 20, 1981, Bush was sworn in for the first of two terms as Vice President. In that office, Bush piloted a task force on regulatory relief and coordinated administration efforts to combat international terrorism and wage the international war on drugs.</p>

<h2>Presidency</h2>
<h3>January 20, 1989 - January 20, 1993</h3>
<p>In 1988, George Bush became his Party&#8217;s nominee and the American people&#8217;s choice to be the forty-first President of the United States. President Bush&#8217;s leadership proved critical to the resolution of some of the most daunting conflicts of our time. After 40 years of superpower stalemate, historic events became almost commonplace: the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany; the end of the Cold War and the flowering of democracy in Eastern Europe; and the emergence of a new partnership with Russia, anchored by the historic arms reduction treaties, START I and START II &#8212; the first-ever agreements to dismantle and destroy strategic weapons since the advent of the nuclear age.</p>

<p>On the international economic front, President Bush sought to seize new opportunities through a policy of free trade, pushing to lower trade restrictions and tariff barriers in the GATT talks. In the Western Hemisphere, President Bush&#8217;s free trade efforts culminated in the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative and the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>

<p>With the passing of the Cold War came new challenges. Seeking to demonstrate the post-Cold War possibilities for collective security, President Bush marshaled a 30-nation coalition to oppose Iraq&#8217;s invasion of Kuwait. Desert Storm stands as a testament to Presidential leadership &#8212; and American resolve in an uncertain and often dangerous world.</p>

<p>On the domestic scene, the Bush administration pushed new ideas for educational reform, home ownership and environmental protection. The Americans with Disabilities Act paved new ground for aiding the disadvantaged, and the revision of the Clean Air Act was deemed to be the most significant environmental legislation ever passed.</p>
