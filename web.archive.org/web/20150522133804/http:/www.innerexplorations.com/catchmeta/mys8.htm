    <td width="61%"><font face="Book Antiqua">&nbsp;<p>We have seen how both Bohm and Sheldrake were
    led to the idea of formal causality, and then recognized some of its historical
    antecedents. It is much the same in the case of Jung even though he doesn't use the word
    formal cause or link his ideas with those of Aristotle.</p>
    <p>Now that we are becoming more familiar with the idea of formal causality, if we take
    another look at many of the passages cited in Chapter 3 we can see how close they are to
    that idea. For Jung, imbued with the mentality of modern science, causality can only mean
    efficient causality. Causality, for example, is &quot;the connection between cause and
    effect.&quot; (1) Acausality operates without the normal constraints of space and time so
    it &quot;cannot be a phenomenon of force or energy,&quot; (2) nor be based on &quot;bodies
    in motion.&quot; (3)</p>
    <p>When we look at acausality itself we see that it manifests many of the aspects that
    have been traditionally connected with formal causality. It is connected to finality, and
    a knowledge that is prior to consciousness, and so Jung likened it to similar ideas that
    Driesch had proposed. (4) It is meaning or even transcendental meaning, or we could say,
    information. It is similar to the Taoist idea of nothing that does not appear in the world
    of the senses, but is its &quot;organizer.&quot; (5) It is like the medieval idea of
    correspondentia or the classical idea of the sympathy of all things which allows them to
    interrelate regardless of the distance between them. It is connected to Agrippa von
    Nettesheim's inborn knowledge and perception in living organisms, which again Jung relates
    to similar ideas in Driesch, and to the notion of final cause, which is intimately related
    to formal cause. Further, this is an unconscious or absolute knowledge that Jung links to
    his archetypes considered as formal factors (6) and synchronicity as an unconscious
    knowledge can be related to Plato's forms. And Jung goes so far as to call synchronicity
    itself &quot;a formal factor.&quot; (7) In Jung's mind synchronicity can be further
    connected to the instinct of bees and biological morphogenesis. (8) &quot;Professor A.M.
    Dalcq (of Brussels) understands form, despite its tie with matter, as a 'continuity that
    is supraordinate to the living organism.&quot;' (9)</p>
    <p>Synchronicity might not even be confined to the human psyche, but be found in an
    analogous way in animals and even minerals. (10) Thus there would be &quot;formal factors
    in nature,&quot; and synchronicity would become a specific manifestation of a more
    universal acausal orderedness. There is a close bond between synchronicity and the
    archetypes which, as we have seen, are formal factors in the psyche. Therefore,
    synchronicity as a meaningful coincidence in which we observe a meaningful connection
    between an inner psychic state and an outer event might conceivably be related to the
    formal factors that exist both in the inner and outer world. Jung speculates that both
    these worlds share the same ultimate background, and are parts of an unus mundus which
    embraces both matter and spirit.</p>
    <p>Jung was also struck by the luminosity or what he called a cloud of cognition that is
    to be found in the unconscious that hinted at what Thomists, in turn, might call its
    spiritual or intellectual nature. This is similar to the idea that Maritain developed in
    terms of the spiritual unconscious using similar imagery. Von Franz, in her turn, when
    examining various antecedents to synchronicity, points to Aristotle's nous poietikos, or
    agent intellect, or what we might call with Maritain the illuminating intellect, which is
    the natural spiritual life of the human soul by which it illuminates the images in the
    psyche, unleashing from them their intelligible treasure or immaterial forms. Both the
    human soul, itself, is a form in the classical tradition, and the intellect knows by
    immaterial forms. (11)</p>
    <p>Further, Jung will call the psyche an unextended intensity. &quot;In the light of this
    view the brain might be a transformer station, in which the relatively infinite tension or
    Intensity of the psyche proper is transformed into perceptible frequencies or
    &quot;extensions.&quot; Conversely, the fading of introspective perception of the body
    explains itself as due to a gradual &quot;psychification,&quot; i.e., intensification at
    the expense of extension. Psyche = highest intensity in the smallest space.&quot; (12)</p>
    <p>Jung realizes that here he is pushing his usual language to the limit, but
    interestingly enough, what he arrives at is his own view of what the Thomist would call
    spirit. Finally Jung will apply synchronicity to the relationship of the body to the soul
    as a way to avoid the difficulties that arise from any kind of psychophysical parallelism
    that would try to coordinate them by means of efficient causality. This, too, is very
    close to the Aristotelian idea of the soul as the form of the body, and once Aristotle
    proposes such a relationship he can say, &quot;That is why we can wholely dismiss as
    unnecessary the question of whether the soul and the body are one: it is as meaningless as
    to ask whether the wax and the shape given to it by the stamp are one...&quot; (13)</p>
    <p>Number, itself, which so fascinated Jung and von Franz, is an archetype of order, and
    can function in this context of the relationship between the body and the soul in the same
    way as Aristotle's form does. &quot;As the active ordering factor, it represents, the
    essence of what we generally term 'mind'.&quot; (14) Jung, as we saw in Chapter 3, relates
    the nature of spirit to &quot;a spontaneous principle of movement in the unconscious
    psyche which engenders, autonomously manipulates, and orders inner images,&quot; and von
    Franz comments: &quot;Number is, as it were, the most accessible primitive manifestation
    of this transcendental spontaneous principle of movement in the psyche.&quot; (15) The
    very word archetype means form in this classical tradition, and number was habitually
    related to form.</p>
    <p>What we are faced with, then, is another remarkable example of how a scientist, working
    within his own discipline, has been led to rediscover the idea of formal causality, and
    the more he approached the frontier that psychology shares with the philosophy of nature,
    the more powerful the ontological resonances of his specialized and freshly minted
    vocabulary became.</p>
    <p>But much like the situation with Bohm and Sheldrake, Jung's formulations can present a
    problem for the philosophy of nature. There is certainly no problem simply calling formal
    causality acausal orderedness. Jung is entitled to his own vocabulary. But a problem does
    arise if acausality, reinforced by a perception of the invincibility of the Copenhagen
    interpretation, distinguishes itself not only from efficient causality, but cuts itself
    off from causality altogether. If this were to happen, no explanation of synchronicity
    would be possible, for explanation in its deepest sense means understanding something
    through its causes. Without causality in this wider sense we are left simply with stating
    that synchronistic events exist. There seems no need to go to this extreme. Jung wrote,
    &quot;Causality is only one principle and psychology cannot be exhausted by causal methods
    only, because the mind (=psyche) lives by aims as well.&quot; (16) There is plenty of room
    to discover in Jung's formulation of synchronicity both the final causality that Jung
    mentions here, and formal causality.</p>
    <p>We have already seen two stories which Jung used to illustrate the meaning of
    synchronicity. In the first, a scarbaeid beetle taps at the window of his consulting room,
    and in the second, birds gather at the death of a woman's husband. Let's look at two
    others. The first comes from a 1945 letter from Jung to J.B. Rhine:</p>
    <p>&quot;I walked with a woman patient in the wood. She tells me about the first dream in
    her life that had made an everlasting impression on her. She had seen a spectral fox
    coming downstairs in her parental home. At this moment, a real fox comes out of the trees
    not forty yards away and walks quietly on the path ahead of us for several minutes. The
    animal behaves as if it were a partner in the situation.&quot; (17)</p>
    <p>Jung had prefaced this story with the remarks that the collective unconscious acted
    &quot;as if it were one and not as if it were split into many individuals.&quot; And it
    showed itself not only among human beings, but animals and physical conditions.</p>
    <p>The second story is recounted by Marie-Louise von Franz, and was told to her by a young
    Jewish intern stationed in Hawaii. His nephew's bar mitzvah was coming, and he was
    unfamiliar with the ceremony. So he was reading some of the texts, but in a bored and
    restless way. He soon put them down and reached for von Franz's book on fairy tales. There
    he found one about a white parrot which guarded the source of life, and anyone who reached
    for it in the wrong way was turned to stone. Her interpretation of the fairy tale hinged
    on the lifeless way in which religious truths can be handled and parroted. This story
    struck a deep chord in the doctor, for it was precisely what he had been doing with the
    bar mitzvah texts. At that moment he heard a cawing outside, and looked up to see a white
    parrot in a bush outside his window. (18)</p>
    <p>Jung felt it was unfair to write off those kinds of events as pure chance, but at the
    same time, he knew that they fell outside of causality as modern science understood the
    term. This left him with either simply stating that they happened - which most people
    accepted already - or trying to give some sort of explanation of them. But giving an
    explanation is perilously close, even identical, to talking about causality, and we saw
    how Jung began to rediscover the idea of formal causality.</p>
    <p>This rediscovery, however, was never formally made, and Jung never developed a
    full-fledged explanation. Two of his basic premises prevented him from coming to terms
    with formal causality. The first was his insistence that causality, itself, had been
    superseded by the discover<span lang="en-us">ies</span> of modern science. Therefore synchronicity must be acausal.
    The second was an even more general premise in which he held that as a psychologist his
    goal was a deeper and deeper knowledge of psychic images, but not the things in
    themselves, i.e., the archetypes that gave rise to them. This was a valid way of
    proceeding for an empirical psychology, but Jung, under the influence of Kant, extended it
    to become a general epistemological principle in which we only know psychic images, not
    things in themselves, no matter what methods we use.</p>
    <p>These presuppositions of Jung allow us to understand his ideas on synchronicity more
    clearly. He was struck by the fact that in Rhine's experiments distance and time seemed no
    obstacles to extrasensory perception. This, he felt, ruled out any understanding of it
    based on a normal transmission of energy. But since he identified all causality with
    efficient causality, then he came to the conclusion there could be no causal explanation
    whatsoever. Therefore, in order to understand paranormal or synchronistic events, he
    considered the possibility that a psychic factor could have made space and time elastic,
    and have reduced them to the vanishing point. This type of explanation was congenial to
    him, for it fit in with his Kantian-style presuppositions. &quot;In themselves, space and
    time consist of nothing. They are hypostatized concepts born of the discriminating
    activity of the conscious mind, and they form the indispensable co-ordinates for
    describing the behaviour of bodies in motion. They are, therefore, essentially psychic in
    origin, which is probably the reason that impelled Kant to regard them as a priori
    categories.&quot; (19)</p>
    <p>The psychic condition that brings about this relativization is the activation of an
    archetype in the collective unconscious. In the case of the scarab beetle, for example,
    the woman has become dead-ended because of her rationalistic cast of mind. The psychic
    energy that previously animated her consciousness has flowed into the unconscious with
    which it forms one energetic system, and has activated an archetype which holds the
    promise of a solution to the dilemma and which gives rise to her dream. But when Jung
    considers the relationship between the dream and the arrival of the beetle at his window,
    he is struck by the strange knowledge that the psyche seems to have of the event to come,
    and he is going to try to explain this knowledge by a shrinking of space and time in which
    the unconscious already knows of the event before it happens. &quot;The scarab dream is a
    conscious representation arising from an unconscious, already existing image of the
    situation that will occur on the following day...&quot; (20)</p>
    <p>But Jung is aware that there is another possibility in which the archetype which gives
    rise to the dream in some mysterious way brings about the outer event of the arrival of
    the beetle at his window. But for Jung that smacked of &quot;magical causality&quot; and
    his presuppositions prevented him from looking in that direction. He is left, then, with
    positing a transcendental or absolute knowledge in the psyche either without explaining it
    or linking it with the shrinking of space and time which, itself, demands a great deal of
    explanation. This was unfortunate for he had collected some fascinating texts that spoke
    about this other possibility, but he could not fully exploit them. He cites, for example,
    Albertus Magnus to the effect:</p>
    <p>&quot;I discovered an instructive account (of magic) in Avicenna's <i>Liber sextus
    naturalium</i>, which says that a certain power (virtus) to alter things indwells in the
    human soul and subordinates the other things to her, particularly when she is swept into a
    great excess of love or hate or the like. When therefore the soul of a man falls into a
    great excess of any passion, it can be proved by experiment that it (the excess) binds
    things (magically) and alters them in the way it wants, and for a long time I did not
    believe it, but after I had read the nigromantic books and others of the kind on signs and
    magic, I found that the emotionality of the human soul is the chief cause of all these
    things, whether because, on account of her great emotion, she alters her bodily substance
    and the other things towards which she strives, or because, on account of her dignity, the
    other, lower things are subject to her, or because the appropriate hour or astrological
    situation or another power coincides with so inordinate an emotion, and we (in
    consequence) believe that what this power does is then done by the soul.&quot; (21)</p>
    <p>This is a fascinating passage. Albertus Magnus, who was the teacher of St. Thomas,
    gives us three reasons for the power of the soul over other things. The first is because
    of her great emotion, and this is similar to how Jung describes the role of the activated
    archetype in synchronistic events. The second is on account of her dignity, and we can
    take this as an expression of the interconnectedness of the soul with the universe. The
    third reason in which the appropriate hour coincides with the emotion in the soul, and so
    we believe that the soul brings it about, is more like a simple statement of the existence
    of synchronistic events. This leaves us with the first two reasons as the raw material
    from which a philosophical explanation could begin to emerge. Jung goes on to quote
    Goethe: &quot;We all have certain electric and magnetic powers within us and our cells
    exercise an attractive and repelling force, according as we come into touch with something
    like or unlike.&quot; (22) Later he will quote Pico della Mirandola: &quot;Firstly there
    is the unity in things whereby each thing is at one with itself, consists of itself, and
    coheres with itself. Secondly there is the unity whereby one creature is united with the
    others and all parts of the world constitutes one world. The third and most important
    (unity) is that whereby the whole universe is one with its Creator, as an army with its
    commander.&quot; (23)</p>
    <p>It would take us too far afield to discuss other problems that arise from Jung's
    Kantian presuppositions, and to explore other interesting -ways in which Jungian
    psychology could enter into dialogue with a Thomist philosophy of nature. I have looked at
    both of those issues in detail elsewhere. (24) We have seen, however, enough over the last
    three chapters to convince us, I hope, that it is worth trying to explore in depth a
    philosophical view of matter and form, and the sympathy of the forms.&nbsp;</font></td>
