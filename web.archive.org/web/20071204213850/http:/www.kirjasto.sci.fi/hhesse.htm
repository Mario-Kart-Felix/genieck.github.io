<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->German poet and novelist, who has explored 
in his work the duality of spirit and nature and 
individual's spiritual search outside restrictions of
the society. Hesse was awarded  the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946. Several of Hesse's novels depict the protagonist's journey into the inner self. A spiritual guide assists the hero in his quest for self-knowledge and shows the way beyond the world &quot;deluded by money, number and time.&quot; </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>&quot;Despair is the result of each earnest attempt to go through life with virtue, justice and understanding and fulfill their requirements. Children live on one side of despair, the awakened on the other side.&quot;</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Journey to the East</font></i><font size="2">, 1932) </font>



</blockquote>
<p>Hermann Hesse was born into a family of Pietist missionaries and religious 
publishers in the Black Forest town of Calw, in the German state of 
W&#252;ttenberg. Johannes Hesse, his father, was born a Russian citizen in Weissenstein, Estonia. Hesse's mother, Marie Gundert, was born in Talatscheri, India, as the daughter of the Pietist missionary and Indologist, Hermann Gundert. His parents expected him to follow the family tradition 
in theology <font face="Symbol">-</font> they had served as missionaries in India. Hesse entered the Protestant seminary at Maulbronn in 1891, 
but he was expelled from the school. After unhappy experiences at a secular 
school, Hesse left his studies. He worked a bookshop clerk, a mechanic, 
and  a book dealer in T&#252;bingen, where he joined literary circle 
called Le Petit C&#233;nacle. During this period Hesse read voluminously and determined the become a writer. In 1899 Hesse published his first works, 
ROMANTISCHE LIEDER and EINE STUNDE HINTER MITTERNACHT. </p>


<p>Hesse became a freelance writer in 1904 after the publication of his novel PETER CAMENZIND. 
In the  Rousseauesque 'return to nature' story the protagonist leaves the big city to live like Saint Francis of Assisi. The book gained literary success and Hesse married Maria  Bernoulli (1868-1963), a photographer nine years his senior, with whom he had three 
children. A visit in India in 1911 was a disappointment but it gave start to Hesse's studies of Eastern 
religions and the novel SIDDHARTHA (1922). In the story,  based on
the early life of Gautama Buddha, a Brahman son rebels against his father's teaching and traditions. Eventually he finds the ultimate enlightenment. The culture of ancient Hindu and the
ancient Chinese  had a great influence on 
Hesse's works. For several years in the mid-1910s Hesse underwent psychoanalysis under <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071204213850/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/cjung.htm">Carl Jung</a>'s assistant J.B. Lang. 
In the novel ROSSHALDE (1914) Hesse explored the question of whether the artist
should marry. The author's replay was negative and reflected the author's own difficulties. During these years his wife 
suffered from growing mental instability and his son was seriously ill. </p>


<p>In 1912 Hesse and his family took a permanent residence in Switzerland, settling first in Bern.  Martin, his third son, who was born 
in 1911, became seriously ill.  His recuperation was slow and eventually he was placed as a foster child in Kirchdorf.
Hesse volunteered for service in the German army in 1914, but was rejected because of poor health. 
He spent the years of World War I in Switzerland, where he was in charge of the German Embassy's Central Office for the Distribution of Books 
to German Prisoners of War.  In his writings, Hesse attacked the prevailing moods of militarism and nationalism. By his countrymen, Hesse was called a traitor.</p>

<p>Hesse's breakthrough novel was DEMIAN (1919). It was highly praised 
by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071204213850/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/tmann.htm">Thomas Mann</a>, who compared its importance to 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071204213850/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/jjoyce.htm">James Joyce</a>'s <i>Ulysses</i> and 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071204213850/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/agide.htm">Andr&#233; Gide</a>'s <i>The Counterfeiters</i>. The 
novel attracted especially young veterans of the WW I, and reflected 
Hesse's personal crisis and interest in Jungian psychoanalysis.  With Aldous Huxley he shared belief
in the need for spiritual self-realization.   &quot;There is no reality except the one contained 
within us,&quot; Hesse once said. &quot;That is why so many people live such an unreal life. 
They take the images outside them for reality and never allow the world within to assert itself.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Demian</i> was first published under the name of its narrator, 
Emil Sinclair, but later Hesse admitted his authorship. In the Faustian
tale the protagonist is torn between his orderly bourgeois existence and a
chaotic world of sensuality. Hesse later admitted that <i>Demian </i>was a story of &quot;individuation&quot; in the Jungian manner. The author also praised unreservedly Jung's study <i>Psychological Types</i>, but in 1921 he suddenly canceled his analysis with Jung and started to consider him merely one of Freud's most gifted pupils. </p>

<p>Leaving his family in 1919, Hesse moved to Montagnola, in southern 
Switzerland. <i>Siddharta</i> was written during this period. It has been one of Hesse's most widely read work.  Its English translation in the 1950s 
became a spiritual guide to a number of American Beat poets.
Hesse's short marriage to Ruth Wenger, the daughter of the Swiss writer Lisa Wenger, was unhappy.
He had met her in 1919 and wrote in 1922 the fairy tale PIKTOR'S VERWANDLUNGEN for Ruth. In the story a spirit, Piktor, becomes an old tree and finds his youth again from the love of a young girl. Hesse divorced from Maria Bernoulli, and married in 1924 Ruth Wenger, but the marriage ended after a few months. These years produced DER STEPPENWOLF (1927). 
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who was elected Pope Benedict XVI, 
once said that <i>Steppenwolf</i> is among his favorite books because it 
&quot;exposes the problem of modernity's isolated and self-isolating man&quot;. The protagonist,
Harry Haller, goes through his mid-life crisis and must
chose between life of action and contemplation. His initials perhaps are not accidentally like the author's. &quot;The few capacities and pursuits in which I happened to be strong had occupied all my attention, and I had painted a picture of myself as a person who was in fact nothing more tan a most refined and educated specialist in poetry, music and philosophy; and as such I had lived, leaving all the rest of me to be a chaos of potentialities, instincts and impulses which I found an encumbrance and gave the label of Steppenwolf.&quot; Haller feels that he has two beings inside him, and faces his
shadow self, named Hermine. This <i>Doppelg&#228;nger</i> figure introduces
Harry to drinking, dancing, music, sex, and drugs. Finally his personality is disassembled and reassembled in the 'Magic Theatre' <font face="Symbol">-</font> For Madmen Only. </p>


<p>During the Weimar Republic (1919-1933) Hesse stayed aloof from 
politics. BETRACHTUNGEN (1928) and KRIEG UND FRIEDEN (1946) were collections of essays, which reflected his individualism and opposition to mass movements of the day. NARZISS UND GOLDMUND (1930, Narcissus and Goldmund) was a pseudomedieval tale about an abbot and his worldly pupil, both in search of the Great Mother. </p>
<p>In 1931 Hesse married Ninon Dolbin (1895-1966). Ninon was Jewish. She had sent Hesse a letter in 1909 when she was 14, and the correspondence had continued. In 1926 they met accientally. At that time Ninon was separated <font face="Symbol">-</font> she had married the painter B.F. Doldin and planned a career as an art historian. Hesse moved with her to Casa Bodmer, and his restless life became more calm. Hesse's books continued to be published in Germany during the
Nazi regime, and were defended  in a secret circular  in 1937 by Joseph Goebbels. When he wrote for the <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i> Jewish refugees in France accused him of supporting the Nazis, whom  Hesse did not openly oppose. However, he helped political refugees and when <i>Narcissus and Goldmund</i> was reprinted in 1941, he refused to leave out parts which  dealt with pogroms and anti-Semitism. In 1943 he was placed on the Nazi blacklist.</p>


<p>In 1931 Hesse began to work on his masterpiece DAS GLASPERLENSPIEL, which was 
published in 1943. The setting is in the future in the imaginary province 
of Castilia, an intellectual, elitist community, dedicated to mathematics
and music. Knecht ('servant') is chosen by the Old Music Master  
as a suitable aspirant to the Order. He goes to the city of Waldzell
to study, and there he catches the attention of the Magister Ludi, 
Thomas von der Trave (an allusion to Hesse's rival Thomas Mann). He is 
the Master of the Games, a system by which wisdom is communicated.
Knecht dedicates himself to the Game, and on the death of Thomas,
he is elected Magister Ludi. After a decade in his office Knecht tries
to leave to start a life devoted to realizing human rights, but 
accidentally drowns in a mountain lake.  In 1942 Hesse sent
the manuscript to Berlin for publication. It  was not accepted
by the Nazis and the work appeared in Z&#252;rich, Switzerland. However, during the postwar years, Hesse's last major novel, <i>The Glass Bead Game</i>, was compulsory reading in German schools. </p>


<p>After receiving the Nobel Prize Hesse published no major works. Between the years 1945 and 1962 he wrote some 50 poems and about 32 reviews mostly for Swiss newspapers. Hesse died 
of cerebral hemorrhage in his sleep on August 9, 1962 at the age of 
eighty-five. </p>
<p>Colin Wilson placed Heller in his bestseller, <i>The Outsider</i> (1956), beside Sartre and Dostoevsky. In the 1960s and 1970s Hesse became a cult figure for young 
readers. The interest declined in the 1980s. The Californian rock
group <i>Sparrow</i> changed its name to <i>Steppenwolf</i> after Hesse's
classic, and released 'Born to be Wild' (1968), which was featured
in the film <i>Easy Rider</i>. The name was suggested
by  the ABC-Dunhill producer Gabriel Mekler who had read the 

novel. Hesse's books
have gained readers from the New Age movements and he is still one
of the bestselling German-speaking writers throughout world.</p>
