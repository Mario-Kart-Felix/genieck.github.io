As the cards came out, face up, we were all astonished to have each received a hand totaling 21. Then, when the dealer flipped over her hole card, she also had a 21. Staring at the cards, we noticed that the song &quot;Superstition&quot; by Stevie Wonder had begun playing on the casino sound system. I asked probability -- perhaps I should say improbability -- expert David J. Hand about the odds of such an occurrence. Hand is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics and senior research investigator at Imperial College London. He's the former president of the Royal Statistical Society and chief scientific advisor to hedge fund Winton Capital. His new book is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/https://www.forbes.com/\&quot;http://us.macmillan.com/theimprobabilityprinciple/DavidHand\&quot;" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Improbability Principle: Why Coincidences, Miracles and Rare Events Happen Every Day</a> (Farrar, Straus and Groux, A Scientific American book, February 2014). <b>David J. Hand</b>:&nbsp;The key thing here is that it is clearly a very highly improbable event. But even so, the improbability principle can explain it. It does this mainly via its law of truly large numbers, but also using the law of near enough. Essentially, there are vast numbers of blackjack games played around the world each year, so although the chance of such an event on any particular game is very small, the chance that it occurs somewhere amongst all those millions of games is quite high. And we must also bear in mind that that’s not the only unusual event which would lead to a comment. Other striking configurations of cards would do so also. Add all these things up, and it soon reaches the level at which we should <i>expect</i> some apparently extraordinarily unlikely event to occur. To work out the exact odds, I’d need more information - like how many decks were being used in the shoe for that particular game, whether the hands totaling 21 were all just two cards or occurred later in the game, and so on. But (roughly speaking as you say) here is an approximation to an answer - and as I explain in a moment, an approximation is all we need. The approximation I’m going to make is that there were many decks in the shoe, so that dealing one card made little difference to the probability that a card of that value would be drawn at the next deal. It’s clear that if there was actually a small number of decks, then when an ace was dealt the probability that the next card would be an ace would be reduced (and the probability that it was <i>not</i> an ace would be increased), since there would remain fewer aces to draw. My approximation assumes that there are many decks, and hence many aces, so that dealing one ace only has a negligible effect on the chance that the next card is an ace.&nbsp; As I said, it’s an approximation, but it will do to get a handle on the problem. I’m also going to assume, again just to give us a handle, that all the hands were just two card hands. That means they each consisted of one of {10, J, Q, K} along with an Ace. The probability that a randomly dealt pair of cards will contain such a pair is 16/52 &times; 4/52 &times; 2 = 0.047. That’s about 1 in 21 randomly dealt hands of two cards sum to 21. (The 16/52 is the probability of drawing one of {10, J, Q, K}, and the 4/52 is the probability of drawing an Ace. The factor of 2 comes in because the Ace might be dealt first or second.) That’s the probability that a single hand of two cards will sum to 21. The chance that all seven hands (the five other players, you, and the dealer) will each sum to 21 is just that probability multiplied by itself six times: 0.047<sup>7</sup>. That’s about 1 in 1.9 billion. A very improbable event! <i>However, </i>here is where the improbability principle comes in (and why we only needed to calculate things approximately).&nbsp; There are a great many games of blackjack played around the world every day. And they are played day in, day out, year after year. In fact, the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/https://www.forbes.com/\&quot;http://www.statista.com/statistics/221031/total-worldwide-casinos-by-region/\&quot;" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">statistica.com</a> says there are about 3,500 casinos in the world. If (on average) each has 10 simultaneous games of blackjack going on, and if each game takes 5 minutes, and the casinos are open for 5 hours on each of say 350 days per year, that means that each year there are about 735 million games of blackjack played in the world each year. You can plug in your own numbers if you feel mine are unrealistic, but I doubt it will change the conclusion, that there is <i>a very large number of games of blackjack</i> played around the world each year. (And, moreover, this is just counting casinos - not all the private games which go on.) Anyway, the point is that even an event which has a probability as low as 1 in 1.9 billion is quite likely to happen if it has 735 million opportunities to happen.&nbsp; In fact the probability that such a set of hands will be drawn is about 0.31, which means we’d expect to see it happen about once every three years on average. We might then factor in another of the laws, the law of near enough. We’ve been talking about one sort of configuration of hands which surprised people. But there are others - again increasing the chance of improbable events occurring. Finally, I liked the icing on the story, that Stevie Wonder’s “superstition” began playing while the cards were being dealt. To work out the chance of that happening at the same time, I’d need to know how often that track was played, and so on. Whatever the answer, it’s clear that the joint event of getting both those striking card hands and also the track playing is much more improbable than just getting the cards. <i>But</i>, it would have been just as striking if, instead of that track, the sound system had broadcast “Good luck” by Basement Jaxx, or “Get lucky” by Daft Punk, or “Lucky day” by the Rolling Stones, or ....&nbsp; This is another manifestation of the law of near enough: a song about luck, fate, etc is near enough to one about superstition for you to recognise it as noteworthy. Incidentally, it wouldn’t surprise me if casinos favoured tracks which referred to superstitions, luck, fortune, and so on. So perhaps the joint event of your extraordinary card hands, along with Stevie Wonder, is not so startling after all. <b>John Navin</b>: In your book, you detail five improbability laws. Which laws apply to my blackjack experience and how? <b>Hand</b>:&nbsp;The main law which applies is the law of truly large numbers: there are a great many opportunities for the incredibly rare event you witnessed to occur. With so many opportunities, it soon becomes overwhelmingly likely that someone, somewhere, will see such a thing. \n <!--nextpage--> Then both the law of near enough and the law of truly large numbers kicked in with the Stevie Wonder track. You would also have noticed other tracks which, while perhaps not using the word “superstition”, used other words related to the highly improbable event which was unfolding. <b>Navin:</b> I'm quite familiar with &quot;the law of large numbers&quot; but have little familiarity with &quot;the law of the probability lever&quot; -- could you describe that and provide an example? <b>Hand</b>:&nbsp;First, perhaps I should clarify the difference between the <i>law of large numbers</i> and the <i>law of truly large numbers</i>. The first is a standard result in probability theory, basically saying that the average of a sample of numbers is likely to get closer and closer to a constant the larger the sample we take. In contrast, the law of truly large numbers is an aspect of the improbability principle. It says that given enough opportunities, any strange thing is likely to happen. For example, if we go on tossing a coin long enough we can essentially guarantee that at some point we’ll get 10 heads in a row. Or the blackjack hands we’ve just been discussing. The <i>law of the probability lever</i> says that a slight change in the circumstances can have a massive effect on probabilities. In my book, I give many examples, including how events which look like 5 or 10-sigma events (that is, incredibly rare events) should actually be expected to happen quite often, even if we are only slightly mistaken about our beliefs about how the underlying process works. Here’s another more down to earth example. In 2005, one of my PhD students and I attended the same conference in the USA. We bought our plane tickets separately, because we were heading to different places afterwards. But when we boarded, we found we’d been seated next to each other. At first glance that looks like a chance of about 1 in 450: with around 450 seats on the plane, once one of us has bought a ticket, there’s about a 1 in 450 chance that the other will be sold the ticket for the adjacent seat. Or is there? We were traveling in the same class, so instead of 1 in 450, it’s 1 in some smaller number. Moreover, most seats occur in pairs or more, not as single seats. Since many passengers travel in pairs or other groups, naturally requesting adjacent seats, singleton travelers are likely to find themselves seated next to other singleton travelers. This further reduces the odds against us being seated separately. Slight changes in the circumstances shifted the probability from 1 in 450 to something much greater. Since your first question concerned Las Vegas, an illustration of the law of the probability lever you may have heard of is card counting. Card counters keep a rough track of which cards have been played, so they can update the odds on particular cards coming up. For example, the more aces which have already been dealt the smaller the chance of an ace coming up next. Indeed, to take an extreme case, if all four aces have been dealt from a single pack, there is <i>no</i> chance of an ace coming up next. A slight change in the circumstances can have a big impact on the probability of the outcome. Another gambling example is given in my book, this time involving roulette. In the second half of the nineteenth century a man named Joseph Jagger collected data on the outcome of rolls of the roulette wheel at a casino in Monte Carlo. He discovered that the probabilities were not quite equal, and using this very slight difference from equality, he built his fortune up to over $4 million in today’s money. <b>Navin</b>: Does one have to be dealing with a defined or closed set of outcomes, with a known likelihood, for mathematics to apply? For example, if I dream of a specific type of rare beetle and then wake up to find that rare beetle sitting on my windowsill, how can &quot;probability&quot; be assigned? <b>Hand</b>:&nbsp;An excellent question. To estimate any probability one does indeed have to have some ideas of the numbers involved. In an example like this, in contrast to casino or lottery examples, it’s difficult to get accurate baseline numbers. But one can often get ballpark figures. How often do insects land on your windowsill? Just how rare are such beetles? Do the calculations, even on very rough numbers, and you will get an estimate of the probability.&nbsp; And one does not need to be too accurate: a 1 in 10,000 chance is very small; a 1 in a million chance is also very small. Even though two probabilities differ by a factor of 1000. So, if this happened to you, whether the probability was one-thousandth or one-millionth, you’d legitimately think “wow! a very unlikely event has occurred.” And this is where the improbability principle comes in. During each night we have many dreams, most of which we forget. But if something related to a dream occurs the next day we are more likely to recall it: certainly seeing the beetle on your windowsill is likely to make you recall the dream. The law of the probability lever is coming into play. Moreover, was your dream about the beetle prompted by something that happened during the day (which you might not be aware of)? Perhaps something you saw or read? It’s entirely possible that the dream and the occurrence on your windowsill were not independent. That means that if one occurs, the other is more likely to occur. Again the law of the probability lever is coming into play to increase the chance of such a coincidence occurring. And let’s factor in the law of near enough and the law of truly large numbers. What if you had instead dreamt of an unusual bird, and such a bird landed on your windowsill the next day? Or not on your windowsill, but on your car? The fact is that there are a great many opportunities for these sorts of coincidences to occur, so it’s not really that surprising when one of them comes up. <b>Navin</b>: Jungian psychologists believe that certain highly improbable events may be significant -- that is, have meaning outside of mathematical frameworks. What are your thoughts about your work as it relates to the concept of synchronicity? \n <!--nextpage--> <b>Hand</b>: Synchronicity is an attempt to come up with an explanation for the occurrence of highly improbable coincidences between events where there is no causal link. It’s based on the premise that existing physics and mathematics cannot explain such things. This is wrong, however - standard science can explain them. That’s really the point of the improbability principle. What I have tried to do is pull out and make explicit how physics and mathematics, in the form of probability calculus does explain why such striking and apparently highly improbable events happen.&nbsp; There’s no need to conjure up other forces or ideas, and there’s no need to attribute mystical meaning or significance to their occurrence. In fact, we should <i>expect</i> them to happen, as they do, purely in the natural course of events. <strong>Navin</strong>: What advice would you give investment managers about handling the risk of improbable events, especially considering how commonplace they can be? <strong>Hand</strong>: The eminent statistician Dennis Lindley coined something he called Cromwell’s Rule. It was based on Oliver Cromwell’s letter to the Church of Scotland, in which Cromwell said “I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken.” Cromwell’s rule says one should never assert something to be either completely impossible or completely certain, unless it is logically so. And that’s the point with scientific models: your model is not the reality, and it’s always possible that your model is wrong. So, while, under the conditions of your model, some event may be so improbable that you can safely ignore it, it’s also possible that your model is wrong and the event is far more probable than you think. So my advice is, be prepared for those highly improbable events: they may not be as improbable as you think. <b>Navin</b>: Without giving specific details, what types of investments have you made? <b>Hand</b>:&nbsp;At present I’m constrained in the types of investment I can make because I’m partly employed by a hedge fund. I do have shares. I think the key thing is to be sanguine about the fluctuations, and take a long term view. For the record, I do occasionally buy lottery tickets. In my book I talk about how to increase the amount you win if you win, and also how to increase your chances of winning. Some kinds of lotteries have structures that you can take advantage of. While I don’t expect to win on any particular draw, my long term expected winnings are greater than 1: that is, on average I will win more than I pay. However, as a general principle one should only play lotteries for fun, not in the expectation of winning - a bit like the casino example you started with. After all, even though my strategies mean I will make money in the long term, “long term” could mean many thousands of years, so I’m not holding my breath. In any case, the point about lotteries is the nature of the utility function: for the price of a coffee, which you probably won’t notice, you buy yourself a chance of winning a fortune. -- <i>For special assistance in preparing this article, my thanks to Allan Combs,&nbsp;the Doshi Professor of Consciousness Studies and Director of The Center for Consciousness Studies at the&nbsp;</i><i><a title=\"California Institute of Integral Studies\" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/https://www.forbes.com/\&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Integral_Studies\&quot;" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">California Institute of Integral Studies</a></i><i>&nbsp;and Professor Emeritus at the University of North Carolina-Asheville.</i></p>","description":"A probability expert explains the highly improbable.","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnavin/2014/02/18/why-coincidences-miracles-and-rare-events-happen-every-day/","comments":[],"visible":true,"blogId":"1361","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/3862","name":"John Navin","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnnavin/files/2016/10/John-Navin_avatar_1476976001-40x40.jpg"},{"size":62,"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnnavin/files/2016/10/John-Navin_avatar_1476976001-62x62.jpg"},{"size":136,"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnnavin/files/2016/10/John-Navin_avatar_1476976001-136x136.jpg"},{"size":400,"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnnavin/files/2016/10/John-Navin_avatar_1476976001-400x400.jpg"}],"url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnavin/","primaryChannel":{"id":"channel_2","channelId":"channel_2","channelName":"Investing","url":"/investing","shortName":"Investing","displayName":"Investing"},"type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/johnnavin/","authorType":"individual","email":"jnavin@gmail.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about taking risks.","timestamp":1490644487829,"description":"I entered the on-line stock trading competition known as Marketocracy in 2001.

As the cards came out, face up, we were all astonished to have each received a hand totaling 21.</p>\n<p>Then, when the dealer flipped over her hole card, she also had a 21. Staring at the cards, we noticed that the song &quot;Superstition&quot; by Stevie Wonder had begun playing on the casino sound system.</p>\n<p>I asked probability -- perhaps I should say improbability -- expert David J. Hand about the odds of such an occurrence.</p>\n<p>Hand is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics and senior research investigator at Imperial College London. He's the former president of the Royal Statistical Society and chief scientific advisor to hedge fund Winton Capital.</p>\n<p>His new book is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/https://www.forbes.com/\&quot;http://us.macmillan.com/theimprobabilityprinciple/DavidHand\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">The Improbability Principle: Why Coincidences, Miracles and Rare Events Happen Every Day</a> (Farrar, Straus and Groux, A Scientific American book, February 2014).</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><b>David J. Hand</b>:&nbsp;The key thing here is that it is clearly a very highly improbable event. But even so, the improbability principle can explain it. It does this mainly via its law of truly large numbers, but also using the law of near enough. Essentially, there are vast numbers of blackjack games played around the world each year, so although the chance of such an event on any particular game is very small, the chance that it occurs somewhere amongst all those millions of games is quite high. And we must also bear in mind that that’s not the only unusual event which would lead to a comment. Other striking configurations of cards would do so also. Add all these things up, and it soon reaches the level at which we should <i>expect</i> some apparently extraordinarily unlikely event to occur.</p>\n<p>To work out the exact odds, I’d need more information - like how many decks were being used in the shoe for that particular game, whether the hands totaling 21 were all just two cards or occurred later in the game, and so on. But (roughly speaking as you say) here is an approximation to an answer - and as I explain in a moment, an approximation is all we need.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>The approximation I’m going to make is that there were many decks in the shoe, so that dealing one card made little difference to the probability that a card of that value would be drawn at the next deal. It’s clear that if there was actually a small number of decks, then when an ace was dealt the probability that the next card would be an ace would be reduced (and the probability that it was <i>not</i> an ace would be increased), since there would remain fewer aces to draw. My approximation assumes that there are many decks, and hence many aces, so that dealing one ace only has a negligible effect on the chance that the next card is an ace.&nbsp; As I said, it’s an approximation, but it will do to get a handle on the problem.</p>\n<p>I’m also going to assume, again just to give us a handle, that all the hands were just two card hands. That means they each consisted of one of {10, J, Q, K} along with an Ace. The probability that a randomly dealt pair of cards will contain such a pair is 16/52 &times; 4/52 &times; 2 = 0.047. That’s about 1 in 21 randomly dealt hands of two cards sum to 21. (The 16/52 is the probability of drawing one of {10, J, Q, K}, and the 4/52 is the probability of drawing an Ace. The factor of 2 comes in because the Ace might be dealt first or second.)</p>\n<p>That’s the probability that a single hand of two cards will sum to 21. The chance that all seven hands (the five other players, you, and the dealer) will each sum to 21 is just that probability multiplied by itself six times: 0.047<sup>7</sup>. That’s about 1 in 1.9 billion. A very improbable event!</p>\n<p><i>However, </i>here is where the improbability principle comes in (and why we only needed to calculate things approximately).&nbsp; There are a great many games of blackjack played around the world every day. And they are played day in, day out, year after year. In fact, the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/https://www.forbes.com/\&quot;http://www.statista.com/statistics/221031/total-worldwide-casinos-by-region/\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">statistica.com</a> says there are about 3,500 casinos in the world. If (on average) each has 10 simultaneous games of blackjack going on, and if each game takes 5 minutes, and the casinos are open for 5 hours on each of say 350 days per year, that means that each year there are about 735 million games of blackjack played in the world each year. You can plug in your own numbers if you feel mine are unrealistic, but I doubt it will change the conclusion, that there is <i>a very large number of games of blackjack</i> played around the world each year. (And, moreover, this is just counting casinos - not all the private games which go on.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, the point is that even an event which has a probability as low as 1 in 1.9 billion is quite likely to happen if it has 735 million opportunities to happen.&nbsp; In fact the probability that such a set of hands will be drawn is about 0.31, which means we’d expect to see it happen about once every three years on average.</p>\n<p>We might then factor in another of the laws, the law of near enough. We’ve been talking about one sort of configuration of hands which surprised people. But there are others - again increasing the chance of improbable events occurring.</p>\n<p>Finally, I liked the icing on the story, that Stevie Wonder’s “superstition” began playing while the cards were being dealt. To work out the chance of that happening at the same time, I’d need to know how often that track was played, and so on. Whatever the answer, it’s clear that the joint event of getting both those striking card hands and also the track playing is much more improbable than just getting the cards. <i>But</i>, it would have been just as striking if, instead of that track, the sound system had broadcast “Good luck” by Basement Jaxx, or “Get lucky” by Daft Punk, or “Lucky day” by the Rolling Stones, or ....&nbsp; This is another manifestation of the law of near enough: a song about luck, fate, etc is near enough to one about superstition for you to recognise it as noteworthy. Incidentally, it wouldn’t surprise me if casinos favoured tracks which referred to superstitions, luck, fortune, and so on. So perhaps the joint event of your extraordinary card hands, along with Stevie Wonder, is not so startling after all.</p>\n<p><b>John Navin</b>: In your book, you detail five improbability laws. Which laws apply to my blackjack experience and how?</p>\n<p><b>Hand</b>:&nbsp;The main law which applies is the law of truly large numbers: there are a great many opportunities for the incredibly rare event you witnessed to occur. With so many opportunities, it soon becomes overwhelmingly likely that someone, somewhere, will see such a thing.</p>","<p>Then both the law of near enough and the law of truly large numbers kicked in with the Stevie Wonder track. You would also have noticed other tracks which, while perhaps not using the word “superstition”, used other words related to the highly improbable event which was unfolding.</p>\n<p><b>Navin:</b> I'm quite familiar with &quot;the law of large numbers&quot; but have little familiarity with &quot;the law of the probability lever&quot; -- could you describe that and provide an example?</p>\n<p><b>Hand</b>:&nbsp;First, perhaps I should clarify the difference between the <i>law of large numbers</i> and the <i>law of truly large numbers</i>. The first is a standard result in probability theory, basically saying that the average of a sample of numbers is likely to get closer and closer to a constant the larger the sample we take. In contrast, the law of truly large numbers is an aspect of the improbability principle. It says that given enough opportunities, any strange thing is likely to happen. For example, if we go on tossing a coin long enough we can essentially guarantee that at some point we’ll get 10 heads in a row. Or the blackjack hands we’ve just been discussing.</p>\n<p>The <i>law of the probability lever</i> says that a slight change in the circumstances can have a massive effect on probabilities. In my book, I give many examples, including how events which look like 5 or 10-sigma events (that is, incredibly rare events) should actually be expected to happen quite often, even if we are only slightly mistaken about our beliefs about how the underlying process works.</p>\n<p>Here’s another more down to earth example. In 2005, one of my PhD students and I attended the same conference in the USA. We bought our plane tickets separately, because we were heading to different places afterwards. But when we boarded, we found we’d been seated next to each other. At first glance that looks like a chance of about 1 in 450: with around 450 seats on the plane, once one of us has bought a ticket, there’s about a 1 in 450 chance that the other will be sold the ticket for the adjacent seat.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Or is there? We were traveling in the same class, so instead of 1 in 450, it’s 1 in some smaller number. Moreover, most seats occur in pairs or more, not as single seats. Since many passengers travel in pairs or other groups, naturally requesting adjacent seats, singleton travelers are likely to find themselves seated next to other singleton travelers. This further reduces the odds against us being seated separately. Slight changes in the circumstances shifted the probability from 1 in 450 to something much greater.</p>\n<p>Since your first question concerned Las Vegas, an illustration of the law of the probability lever you may have heard of is card counting. Card counters keep a rough track of which cards have been played, so they can update the odds on particular cards coming up. For example, the more aces which have already been dealt the smaller the chance of an ace coming up next. Indeed, to take an extreme case, if all four aces have been dealt from a single pack, there is <i>no</i> chance of an ace coming up next. A slight change in the circumstances can have a big impact on the probability of the outcome.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Another gambling example is given in my book, this time involving roulette. In the second half of the nineteenth century a man named Joseph Jagger collected data on the outcome of rolls of the roulette wheel at a casino in Monte Carlo. He discovered that the probabilities were not quite equal, and using this very slight difference from equality, he built his fortune up to over $4 million in today’s money.</p>\n<p><b>Navin</b>: Does one have to be dealing with a defined or closed set of outcomes, with a known likelihood, for mathematics to apply? For example, if I dream of a specific type of rare beetle and then wake up to find that rare beetle sitting on my windowsill, how can &quot;probability&quot; be assigned?</p>\n<p><b>Hand</b>:&nbsp;An excellent question. To estimate any probability one does indeed have to have some ideas of the numbers involved. In an example like this, in contrast to casino or lottery examples, it’s difficult to get accurate baseline numbers. But one can often get ballpark figures. How often do insects land on your windowsill? Just how rare are such beetles?</p>\n<p>Do the calculations, even on very rough numbers, and you will get an estimate of the probability.&nbsp; And one does not need to be too accurate: a 1 in 10,000 chance is very small; a 1 in a million chance is also very small. Even though two probabilities differ by a factor of 1000.</p>\n<p>So, if this happened to you, whether the probability was one-thousandth or one-millionth, you’d legitimately think “wow! a very unlikely event has occurred.” And this is where the improbability principle comes in.</p>\n<p>During each night we have many dreams, most of which we forget. But if something related to a dream occurs the next day we are more likely to recall it: certainly seeing the beetle on your windowsill is likely to make you recall the dream. The law of the probability lever is coming into play.</p>\n<p>Moreover, was your dream about the beetle prompted by something that happened during the day (which you might not be aware of)? Perhaps something you saw or read? It’s entirely possible that the dream and the occurrence on your windowsill were not independent. That means that if one occurs, the other is more likely to occur. Again the law of the probability lever is coming into play to increase the chance of such a coincidence occurring.</p>\n<p>And let’s factor in the law of near enough and the law of truly large numbers. What if you had instead dreamt of an unusual bird, and such a bird landed on your windowsill the next day? Or not on your windowsill, but on your car? The fact is that there are a great many opportunities for these sorts of coincidences to occur, so it’s not really that surprising when one of them comes up.</p>\n<p><b>Navin</b>: Jungian psychologists believe that certain highly improbable events may be significant -- that is, have meaning outside of mathematical frameworks. What are your thoughts about your work as it relates to the concept of synchronicity?</p>","<p><b>Hand</b>: Synchronicity is an attempt to come up with an explanation for the occurrence of highly improbable coincidences between events where there is no causal link. It’s based on the premise that existing physics and mathematics cannot explain such things. This is wrong, however - standard science can explain them. That’s really the point of the improbability principle. What I have tried to do is pull out and make explicit how physics and mathematics, in the form of probability calculus does explain why such striking and apparently highly improbable events happen.&nbsp; There’s no need to conjure up other forces or ideas, and there’s no need to attribute mystical meaning or significance to their occurrence. In fact, we should <i>expect</i> them to happen, as they do, purely in the natural course of events.</p>\n<p><strong>Navin</strong>: What advice would you give investment managers about handling the risk of improbable events, especially considering how commonplace they can be?</p>\n<p><strong>Hand</strong>: The eminent statistician Dennis Lindley coined something he called Cromwell’s Rule. It was based on Oliver Cromwell’s letter to the Church of Scotland, in which Cromwell said “I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken.” Cromwell’s rule says one should never assert something to be either completely impossible or completely certain, unless it is logically so. And that’s the point with scientific models: your model is not the reality, and it’s always possible that your model is wrong. So, while, under the conditions of your model, some event may be so improbable that you can safely ignore it, it’s also possible that your model is wrong and the event is far more probable than you think.</p>\n<p>So my advice is, be prepared for those highly improbable events: they may not be as improbable as you think.</p>\n<p><b>Navin</b>: Without giving specific details, what types of investments have you made?</p>\n<p><b>Hand</b>:&nbsp;At present I’m constrained in the types of investment I can make because I’m partly employed by a hedge fund. I do have shares. I think the key thing is to be sanguine about the fluctuations, and take a long term view.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>For the record, I do occasionally buy lottery tickets. In my book I talk about how to increase the amount you win if you win, and also how to increase your chances of winning. Some kinds of lotteries have structures that you can take advantage of. While I don’t expect to win on any particular draw, my long term expected winnings are greater than 1: that is, on average I will win more than I pay. However, as a general principle one should only play lotteries for fun, not in the expectation of winning - a bit like the casino example you started with. After all, even though my strategies mean I will make money in the long term, “long term” could mean many thousands of years, so I’m not holding my breath. In any case, the point about lotteries is the nature of the utility function: for the price of a coffee, which you probably won’t notice, you buy yourself a chance of winning a fortune.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><i>For special assistance in preparing this article, my thanks to Allan Combs,&nbsp;the Doshi Professor of Consciousness Studies and Director of The Center for Consciousness Studies at the&nbsp;</i><i><a title=\"California Institute of Integral Studies\" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/https://www.forbes.com/\&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Integral_Studies\&quot;" target=\"_blank\">California Institute of Integral Studies</a></i><i>&nbsp;and Professor Emeritus at the University of North Carolina-Asheville.</i></p>"],"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"doNotPaginate":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_2","channelName":"Investing","url":"/investing","displayName":"Investing"},{"id":"channel_2section_62","channelName":"Investing","sectionName":"Markets","url":"/markets","displayName":"Markets"},{"id":"channel_2section_64","channelName":"Investing","sectionName":"Stocks","url":"/stocks","displayName":"Stocks"}],"pTagCount":0,"numberOfImages":0,"digestDisabled":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"Why Coincidences, Miracles And Rare Events Happen Every Day","groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-1361","name":"Probabilities","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnavin/","primaryChannel":{"id":"channel_2","channelId":"channel_2","channelName":"Investing","url":"/investing","shortName":"Investing","displayName":"Investing"},"profileUrl":"https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/http://blogs.forbes.com/johnnavin/profile/","authorType":"individual","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1473605003085,"recentFlag":false,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-1361","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/3862","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/3862","name":"John Navin","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3a7e704b6128587ca699c65d6ada6581?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3a7e704b6128587ca699c65d6ada6581?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":136,"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3a7e704b6128587ca699c65d6ada6581?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205721/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3a7e704b6128587ca699c65d6ada6581?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about taking risks.","description":"I entered the on-line stock trading competition known as Marketocracy in 2001.

It’s based on the premise that existing physics and mathematics cannot explain such things. This is wrong, however - standard science can explain them. That’s really the point of the improbability principle. What I have tried to do is pull out and make explicit how physics and mathematics, in the form of probability calculus does explain why such striking and apparently highly improbable events happen.&nbsp; There’s no need to conjure up other forces or ideas, and there’s no need to attribute mystical meaning or significance to their occurrence. In fact, we should <i>expect</i> them to happen, as they do, purely in the natural course of events.</p>
<p><strong>Navin</strong>: What advice would you give investment managers about handling the risk of improbable events, especially considering how commonplace they can be?</p>
<p><strong>Hand</strong>: The eminent statistician Dennis Lindley coined something he called Cromwell’s Rule. It was based on Oliver Cromwell’s letter to the Church of Scotland, in which Cromwell said “I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken.” Cromwell’s rule says one should never assert something to be either completely impossible or completely certain, unless it is logically so. And that’s the point with scientific models: your model is not the reality, and it’s always possible that your model is wrong. So, while, under the conditions of your model, some event may be so improbable that you can safely ignore it, it’s also possible that your model is wrong and the event is far more probable than you think.</p>
<p>So my advice is, be prepared for those highly improbable events: they may not be as improbable as you think.</p>
<p><b>Navin</b>: Without giving specific details, what types of investments have you made?</p>
<p><b>Hand</b>:&nbsp;At present I’m constrained in the types of investment I can make because I’m partly employed by a hedge fund. I do have shares. I think the key thing is to be sanguine about the fluctuations, and take a long term view.</p>

<p>For the record, I do occasionally buy lottery tickets. In my book I talk about how to increase the amount you win if you win, and also how to increase your chances of winning. Some kinds of lotteries have structures that you can take advantage of. While I don’t expect to win on any particular draw, my long term expected winnings are greater than 1: that is, on average I will win more than I pay. However, as a general principle one should only play lotteries for fun, not in the expectation of winning - a bit like the casino example you started with. After all, even though my strategies mean I will make money in the long term, “long term” could mean many thousands of years, so I’m not holding my breath. In any case, the point about lotteries is the nature of the utility function: for the price of a coffee, which you probably won’t notice, you buy yourself a chance of winning a fortune.</p>
