USIA White House Correspondent

Washington -- President Bush December 24 granted pardons to former

Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and five other individuals for their

conduct related to the Iran-Contra affair.<p>Bush said Weinberger -- who had been scheduled to go on trial in Washington

January 5 on charges related to Iran-Contra -- was a "true American

patriot," who had served with "distinction" in a series of public positions

since the late 1960s.<p>"I am pardoning him not just out of compassion or to spare a 75-year-old

patriot the torment of lengthy and costly legal proceedings, but to make it

possible for him to receive the honor he deserves for his extraordinary

service to our country," Bush said in a proclamation granting executive

clemency.<p>The president also pardoned five other persons who already had pleaded

guilty or had been indicted or convicted in connection with the Iran-Contra

arms-for-hostages investigation.  They were Elliott Abrams, a former

assistant secretary of state for Inter-American affairs; former National

Security Adviser Robert McFarlane; and Duane Clarridge, Alan Fiers, and

Clair George, all former employees of the Central Intelligence Agency.<p>Explaining those pardons, Bush said the "common denominator of their

motivation -- whether their actions were right or wrong -- was patriotism."

 They did not profit or seek to profit from their conduct, Bush said,

adding that all five "have already paid a price -- in depleted savings,

lost careers, anguished families -- grossly disproportionate to any

misdeeds or errors of judgment they may have committed."<p>Asked about the pardons at a news conference in Little Rock, Arkansas, later

in the day, President-elect Clinton said he did not have all the details on

the matter and would withhold comment until he had had a chance to study

the president's statement and related information.<p>However, Clinton said he was concerned "by any action which sends a signal

that, if you work for the government, you're above the law, or that not

telling the truth to Congress under oath is somehow less serious than not

telling the truth to some other body under oath."<p>The Iran-Contra affair involved the secret sale of weapons to Iran in

exchange for the release of American hostages held in Lebanon by

pro-Iranian terrorists and the diversion of money from that sale to provide

support for anti-communist resistance fighters in Nicaragua known as the

"Contras."<p>Weinberger had been charged by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh with four

counts of lying to congressional Iran-Contra investigators in 1987 and to

Walsh's prosecutors in 1990.  His case involved allegations that he had

concealed from congressional investigators his personal notes that detailed

events related to Iran-Contra and which reportedly undermined what

then-President Reagan said about the origins and operations of the covert

arms-for-hostages dealings.  Weinberger had pleaded not guilty and said he

was being unfairly prosecuted.<p>Although a president has unlimited pardon powers, it is highly unusual to

pardon someone before trial and conviction.  The best-known precedent --

following the Watergate political scandal during the Nixon administration

-- was former President Ford's pardon in 1974 of former President Nixon,

who was never indicted.<p>Bush said the prosecutions of the persons he was pardoning on Christmas Eve

represent "what I believe is a profoundly troubling development in the

political and legal climate of our country:  the criminalization of policy

differences."<p>The differences should be addressed in "the political arena, without the

Damocles sword of criminality hanging over the heads of some of the

combatants," he said.  "The proper target is the president, not his

subordinates; the proper forum is the voting booth, not the courtroom."<p>Bush also granted Christmas Eve pardons to 18 other individuals who were not

involved in the Iran-Contra affair.<p>NNNN
