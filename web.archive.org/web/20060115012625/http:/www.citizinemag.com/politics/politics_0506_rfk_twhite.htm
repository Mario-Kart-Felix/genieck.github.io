            <p><font size="2"><b>By Thom White</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2"> June 5, 2005 LOS ANGELES -- The L.A. Unified School 
              District is about to knock down the historic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060115012625/http://www.citizinemag.com/politics/politics_0506_ambassador_twhite.htm">Ambassador 
              Hotel</a> to build some schools -- another example of L.A. tearing 
              down and paving over what is supposed to be such a proud civic history.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Demolition is set to begin while a legal petition 
              rests before the California Supreme Court presenting evidence that 
              calls into question what really happened in the most important event 
              to take place during the Ambassador&#146;s 85-year history: the 
              assassination of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">In the summer of 1969, a Palestinian immigrant by 
              the improbable and unmistakeably foreign name of Sirhan Sirhan was 
              convicted of murdering the candidate for the U.S. presidency. However, 
              bullet hole evidence, the L.A. County coroner&#146;s autopsy report, 
              and eyewitness accounts of the assassination and crime scene investigation, 
              all provide substantial evidence to support the claim that it was 
              not physically possible for Sirhan Sirhan to have been Robert F. 
              Kennedy&#146;s murderer, and that it was another person in the jam-packed 
              pantry (directly behind and to the right of Kennedy) who committed 
              this murder at midnight. So does Sirhan Sirhan deserve a retrial? 
              And what is L.A. covering up now with all this fresh tar and asphalt? 
              To really know, you need some details.</font><font size="2"><br>

            <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              Rise of Robert F. Kennedy</font></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060115012625/http://www.rfkmemorial.org/RFK/" target="_blank">Robert 
              Francis Kennedy</a> came from the wealthy and politically powerful 
              Kennedy and Fitzgerald clans. His father, industrialist Joseph P. 
              Kennedy, rose to great wealth during Prohibition, and prominence 
              under FDR, and set the stage for the political careers of his sons. 
              Robert managed older brother John&#146;s successful run for Senate 
              in 1952, and then John&#146;s bigger run for the presidency in 1960. 
              In November 1960, John defeated Vice-President Richard M. Nixon 
              to be elected president of the United States, although evidence 
              emerged later that Kennedy&#146;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060115012625/http://psychcentral.com/psypsych/U.S._presidential_election,_1960">wins 
              in Texas and Illinois</a> (which handed him the national victory) 
              were the result of voter fraud. Further research has shown that 
              Kennedy&#146;s running mate, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060115012625/http://www.eiu.edu/%7Ehistoria/1999/texas99.htm" target="_blank">Sen. 
              Lyndon B. Johnson</a>, had won previous Senate elections in Texas 
              in 1948 and 1954 through voter fraud. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">President Jack named Robert to be the most powerful 
              lawyer in the land, Attorney General, and Bobby did his best to 
              help guide the Kennedy administration&#146;s &#147;cold war liberal&#148; 
              legislative agenda. After his brother&#146;s murder by gunmen in 
              the streets of Dallas on 11/22, Robert stayed on for a turn under 
              LBJ. He then resigned to run for the U.S. Senate in New York, and 
              he won that election in 1964. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">By 1967, the number of dead and wounded U.S. soldiers 
              being returned from Vietnam had reached an unpopular level. Catholic 
              Democrat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060115012625/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_McCarthy" target="_blank">Eugene 
              McCarthy</a>, a Senator from Minnesota, began campaigning against 
              President Lyndon Johnson in 1967 on a clear platform of negotiated 
              peace with the Communists, eventual withdrawal of Americans from 
              the foreign strife, and an end to U.S. military control of the southern 
              end of Indochina. When Johnson barely edged out McCarthy in the 
              first Democratic primary in New Hampshire (a victory for McCarthy), 
              the President announced he would not seek re-election. Senator Robert 
              Kennedy and Vice President Hubert Humphrey would throw their hats 
              in the ring to challenge McCarthy for the nomination.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">In Spring 1968, Sen. McCarthy and Sen. Kennedy split 
              80% of the voters in many of the Democratic state primaries, while 
              V.P. Humphrey would pull in 10-15%. On the Oregon ballot in late 
              May, Gene McCarthy pulled off a big win against Kennedy. Kennedy 
              turned to concentrate his resources on winning the state primary 
              in California, where he was thought to have an advantage. A victory 
              there on June 4 would give him the momentum to gain the Party nomination 
              at what was to be a contentious Democratic Convention in Chicago.</font></p>

              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scene of the 
              crime</font></font></b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Robert Kennedy&#146;s California campaign was headquartered 
              at the Ambassador Hotel. By nightfall on June 4, campaign workers 
              and media crowded the Ambassador&#146;s Embassy Ballroom, watching 
              television for ballot results as the evening progressed. Kennedy 
              himself was in the Royal Suite and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060115012625/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/kennedy/2.html?sect=24" target="_blank">Court 
              TV Crime Library</a> describes the scene:</font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><i>RFK remained watchful, cautious, glued to his 
              television in the Royal Suite where good friends, political allies 
              and a few celebrities encircled him. Comedian Milton Berle and football 
              great Roosevelt &#147;Rosey&#148; Grier were there, and so was Decathlon 
              champ Rafer Johnson. Occasionally, Kennedy leaned over to joke with 
              one of these men or to seek advice from one of his aides and advisors 
              - Pierre Salinger, Ted Sorenson or press secretary Fred Mankiewicz, 
              for example ... Wife Ethel, in her early pregnancy with their eleventh 
              child, relaxed on the sofa near her husband &#133;</i></font></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">By 11:30 p.m., a victory for Kennedy seemed imminent. 
              With wife Ethel and his entourage, the senator moved to the ballroom 
              where, upon entering, he was greeted by frantic applause. Red-white-and-blue 
              ribbons decorated the wall behind the speaker&#146;s podium and 
              balloons colored the ceiling overhead. Flashbulbs popped, and music 
              from an orchestra sent the sea of heads before the stage bobbing 
              in rhythm. Raising his arms for attention, a smiling &#147;Bobby,&#148; 
              as his fans called him, thanked the room for their great support 
              and, adding a bit of humor, thanked pitcher Don Drysdale for winning 
              his sixth straight shut-out that afternoon.</font></i></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">Then the speech turned serious. Kennedy addressed 
              the fact that the nation needed to overcome racial divisions and 
              other social evils (the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King 
              had taken place exactly two months before to the day), as well as 
              an end to the unpopular war in Vietnam. Concluding his speech with 
              a victory sign and the words, &#147;&#133;now on to Chicago, and 
              let&#146;s win there!&#148; the house once again broke loose. &#147;We 
              want Bobby! We want Bobby!&#148; sang the house. Grinning, he turned 
              towards the side door that would take him through a food preparation 
              area, a short cut to where the press was waiting in the Colonial 
              Room beyond. It was now 12:15 a.m., June 5.</font></i></p>
            <p><font size="2">According L.A. Rams tackle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060115012625/http://www.nndb.com/people/635/000023566/" target="_blank">Rosey 
              Grier</a>&#146;s testimony to the LAPD, at the end of Kennedy&#146;s 
              speech, the group on-stage had planned to exit to the right to head 
              to a press conference, but at the last moment, the head of RFK&#146;s 
              security, Bill Barry, told Kennedy and the entourage to take an 
              alternate route through a pantry area, apparently to avoid some 
              press along the way. According to Grier:</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">&#147;Well, first of all, we were up on the stage, 
              and they said they was going off to the right of the stage, and 
              at the last minute ... Bill Barry decided to change and go a different 
              direction because people had found out which way the senator was 
              going to go, and we had to go downstairs to another ballroom where 
              people were waiting. This was a press gathering here, and so Bill 
              Barry and someone else took the senator down and I was lifting Mrs. 
              Kennedy down from the stairs and we started walking....&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Barry then fell behind the group, staying by the 
              stage to help Ethel Skakel Kennedy from the stage, while Robert 
              Kennedy and crew headed down a ramp through double doors into the 
              kitchen pantry. Lisa Pease describes the scene of the murder in 
              her invaluable 1998 investigative piece in Probe magazine, &#147;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060115012625/http://www.webcom.com/ctka/pr398-rfk.html" target="_blank">Sirhan 
              &amp; the RFK Assassination</a>&#148;:</font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><i>Ma&icirc;tre d&#146; Karl Uecker gripped Kennedy&#146;s 
              right wrist with his left hand. Ace Guard Service employee Thane 
              Eugene Cesar joined Kennedy as he went through the double doors 
              into the pantry, touching his right elbow. Bill Barry, an ex-FBI 
              man who was ostensibly serving as Kennedy&#146;s bodyguard, had 
              fallen behind Kennedy as he entered the pantry.</i></font></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">As they headed east through the room, Kennedy 
              stopped every few feet to shake the hands of hotel workers. The 
              last hand he shook was that of busboy Juan Romero. Uecker pulled 
              Kennedy as he moved forward. The tiny kitchen held, by official 
              count, 77 people (including Sirhan and the shooting victims) who 
              were possible witnesses to what happened next.</font></i></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">Uecker related that with Kennedy still in hand, 
              he felt someone sliding in between himself and the steam table about 
              two feet away from where he stood. Busboy Juan Romero and waiter 
              Martin Patrusky saw Sirhan approach Kennedy, as did Lisa Urso, a 
              San Diego high school student. Urso saw Sirhan push his way past 
              her towards the Senator. She thought he was going to shake his hand, 
              then saw a movement that made her stop in her tracks in frightened 
              anticipation. Vincent DiPierro, a waiter who had observed Sirhan 
              standing and talking to a pretty girl in a white, polka dotted dress 
              earlier that night, heard someone yell &#147;Grab him&#148; a split 
              second before the shots were fired. Somebody reported Sirhan saying, 
              &#147;Kennedy, you son of a bitch,&#148; and then firing at Kennedy 
              with his hand outstretched. </font></i></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">Uecker felt Kennedy slip from his grasp as he 
              fell to the ground. Screams were heard as bystanders Paul Schrade, 
              William Weisel, Ira Goldstein, Erwin Stroll and Elizabeth Evans 
              were hit by flying bullets. Kennedy suffered gunshot wounds in three 
              different places, with a fourth bullet passing through his coat 
              without entering the skin.</font></i></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">Uecker immediately grabbed Sirhan&#146;s hand 
              and forced it down onto the steam table. A swarm of men descended 
              upon Sirhan, surrounding him, holding the gun. Decathlon champion 
              Rafer Johnson, Grier, George Plimpton and others formed a barricade 
              around Sirhan, one holding his head, another with a finger in the 
              trigger to prevent additional shots, another grabbing Sirhan in 
              a crushing bear hug. </font></i></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">Uecker and DiPierro reported initially hearing 
              two shots, followed by a flurry. DiPierro told the LAPD, &#147;I 
              saw the first two go off. I saw them actually.&#148; Several witnesses 
              reported hearing one or two shots, and then a pause. Then all hell 
              broke loose. Witnesses not within eyesight of what was happening 
              thought they were hearing balloons popping or firecrackers. Los 
              Angeles photographer Boris Yaro, in a phone interview with Robert 
              Morrow, recounted his memory of the event:</font></i></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">&#147;There was either one or two shots fired. 
              O.K. And then, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. There was a pregnant 
              pause between those two because my initial impression was some jackass 
              has set off firecrackers in here; because I got hit in the face 
              with debris...And then it hit me. Oh, my God, it&#146;s happened 
              again.&#148;</font></i></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">Sirhan was eventually subdued, and taken into 
              police custody. </font></i></p>
            <p><font size="2">The official line arrived at dawn. June 5: America 
              awakens to the news that beloved Bobby Kennedy had been shot by 
              a Middle-Eastern waiter who approached the Senator among the other 
              well-wishers, not to offer a handshake of goodwill, but with eight 
              rounds of deadly bullet fire. The madman had shot Kennedy in the 
              head and injured five others, before being heroically put in an 
              armlock by members of the celebrity entourage. After being roughed 
              up by the angry crowd at the Ambassador, the Kennedy killer was 
              ceremoniously handed over by State Assemblyman Jesse Unruh to the 
              police.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">At 9 a.m. on June 5, hours after the shootout, members 
              of the Sirhan clan arrived at the police station saying they had 
              seen pictures of their brother on the television. Within hours, 
              police ransacked Sirhan&#146;s mother&#146;s residence in Pasadena 
              (696 E. Howard) and turned up notebook scribblings by Sirhan about 
              how &#147;RFK must die&#148; and how killing Kennedy was becoming 
              an &#147;obsession.&#148; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">June 6: America learns that RFK is dead and had 
              been murdered by the crazed Palestinian partisan Sirhan Sirhan who 
              had a grudge against Kennedy because the Senator supported selling 
              &#147;Phantom&#148; jets to Israel. Ironically, Robert Kennedy would 
              expire on the first anniversary of Israel&#146;s Six Day Invasion 
              of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria which had commenced on 6/6/67.<br>
              It was an &#147;open and shut&#148; case: Sirhan Sirhan had murdered 
              Robert F. Kennedy. But consider the following evidence:</font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><br>
              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Follow the bullets</b></font></font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><b>There is evidence of more than eight bullets 
              being fired. </b>Sirhan&#146;s gun only had eight chambers, and 
              there was no time for him to reload, so for the &#147;crazed lone 
              gunman&#148; theory to be plausible, there could only be evidence 
              of eight bullets fired. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">As many as five or six ceiling panels were removed 
              by the LAPD investigating team, and lead criminalogist DeWayne Wolfer 
              is quoted as saying, &#147;It&#146;s unbelievable how many holes 
              there are in the kitchen ceiling.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Wolfer filled his official report with &#147;magic 
              bullets&#148; (bullets #2, 4, and 6 that supposedly struck more 
              than one person) to stay within the eight-bullet parameters and 
              reach the desired conclusion. Here is how the LAPD accounted for 
              the bullets:</font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><b>Bullet #1</b>: struck Senator Robert F. Kennedy 
              behind the right ear. <br>
              <b>Bullet #2</b>: passed through RFK&#146;s right shoulder pad and 
              struck campaign aide Paul Schrade in the forehead. <br>
              <b>Bullet #3</b>: entered RFK&#146;s back inches below the top of 
              the right shoulder. <br>
              <b>Bullet #4</b>: entered RFK&#146;s back, about one inch below 
              bullet #3, but exited the senator&#146;s body through the right 
              front chest. <br>
              <b>Bullet #5</b>: struck Ira Goldstein in the right rear buttock. 
              <br>
              <b>Bullet #6</b>: passed through Goldstein&#146;s pants leg, struck 
              the cement floor, and, ricocheted onto Irwin Stroll&#146;s left 
              leg. <br>
              <b>Bullet #7</b>: struck William Weisel in the left abdomen. <br>
              <b>Bullet #8</b>: reflected off the plaster ceiling to strike Elizabeth 
              Evans in the head. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Robert Kennedy was shot three times, and five others 
              were shot (that would make eight bullets); one bullet went through 
              Kennedy&#146;s clothing and exited out, and the same happened to 
              Ira Goldstein who had a bullet pass through his clothing without 
              piercing skin. So that would make ten. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Additionally, there was an Associated Press photo 
              published June 5, 1968, which showed two LAPD officers pointing 
              out two bullets lodged in the door jamb between the double doors 
              where Kennedy had entered the pantry, and this would make 12 bullets. 
              Researcher Lisa Pease argues, &#147;If there were more than eight 
              bullets, Sirhan was not a deranged, lone gunman, but somehow part 
              of a conspiracy which has yet to be officially acknowledged.&#148; 
              According to Lisa Pease: </font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><i>In 1975, Vincent Bugliosi, who was then working 
              with [Paul] Schrade [a Kennedy aide who was shot] to get the case 
              reopened, tracked down the two police officers depicted in the photograph. 
              To that time their identities had been unknown. Bugliosi identified 
              the two officers as Sgt. Charles Wright and Sgt. Robert Rozzi. Both 
              Wright and Rozzi were sure that what they observed was not only 
              a bullet hole, but a hole containing a bullet &#133; </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><i>Investigative reporter Jonn Christian found a 
              Chicago Tribune article authored by Robert Weidrich. Weidrich had 
              evidently been in the pantry as the doorjamb was being removed, 
              for his account contained the following information:</i></font></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">&#147;On a low table lay an 8-foot strip of molding, 
              torn by police from the center post of the double doors leading 
              from the ballroom. These were the doors through which Sen. Kennedy 
              had walked....Now the molding bore the scars of a crime laboratory 
              technician&#146;s probe as it had removed two .22-caliber bullets 
              that had gone wild.&#148;</font></i></p>
            <p><font size="2">The LAPD report said these holes were not from bullets 
              and may have been caused by collisions with a food cart, but even 
              FBI agent William Bailey said that for him and other agents, &#147;There 
              was no questions in any of our minds as to the fact that they were 
              bullet holes.&#148; <br>
              These bullets are not accounted for in Wolfer&#146;s LAPD report. 
              This door jamb was destroyed under a court order in 1969 soon after 
              Sirhan&#146;s conviction for murder. </font></p>

            <p><font size="2"><b>The autopsy report proves that it was physically 
              impossible for Sirhan to have fired the fatal shot to the back of 
              Kennedy&#146;s head, or any other shot that struck the Senator. 
              </b>The autopsy shows that Kennedy was shot from behind from below, 
              while all witnesses say that Sirhan Sirhan shot at Robert Kennedy 
              in a face to face position from 2-5 feet away with his arm outstretched 
              horizontally toward the Senator. The trajectories of bullets that 
              struck Kennedy were at sharp upward angles of 60&deg; to 80&deg; 
              (nearly vertical), and the mortal wound fired into his brain was 
              from just a couple inches behind him. <br>

              describes the autopsy:</font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><i>Los Angeles Coroner Thomas Noguchi conducted 
              the official autopsy on the body of Robert Francis Kennedy on the 
              morning of June 6. This very experienced coroner removed one intact 
              bullet and fragments from another. The operation was witnessed by, 
              according to writer Dan Moldea, &#147;three forensic pathologists 
              from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington and by 
              two of Noguchi&#146;s associates.&#148;</i></font></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">In his resulting 62-page report, Noguchi stated 
              that the shot that killed RFK &#147;had entered through the mastoid 
              bone, an inch behind the right ear and had traveled upward to sever 
              the branches of the superior cerebral artery.&#148; The largest 
              fragment of that bullet lodged in the brain stem.</font></i></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">Another shot had penetrated Kennedy&#146;s right 
              armpit and exited through the upper portion of his chest at a 59-degree 
              angle. The coroner determined that the senator&#146;s arm must have 
              been upraised when that bullet entered.</font></i></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">Yet another, a third shot, entered one-and-a-half 
              inches below the previous one and stopped in the neck near the sixth 
              cervical. This is the bullet that was found intact.</font></i></p>
            <p><i><font size="2">Checking Kennedy&#146;s clothing for other telltale 
              signs, Noguchi followed the path between two bullet holes in his 
              suit coat and announced that a fourth bullet had been fired at the 
              senator. It entered and exited the fabric without touching the senator.</font></i></p>
            <p><font size="2">Prosecutors withheld the autopsy report from Sirhan&#146;s 
              defense team until four months into the trial, and after Sirhan&#146;s 
              defense attorney Grant Cooper had needlessly admitted Sirhan&#146;s 
              guilt to the crime of murder during his opening argument. Although 
              the LAPD&#146;s DeWayne Wolfer made a detailed scheme of the path 
              of Sirhan&#146;s eight bullets, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060115012625/http://www.who2.com/thomasnoguchi.html" target="_blank">Thomas 
              Noguchi</a> responded that &#147;there was really no way to accurately 
              trace the flight path of so many bullets.&#148; In his 1983 autobiography 
              <i>Coroner</i>, Noguchi wrote, &#147;Until more is precisely known 
              &#133; the existence of the second gunman remains a possibility. 
              Thus, I have never said that Sirhan Sirhan killed Robert Kennedy.&#148;

            <p><font size="2"><b>Thane Eugene Cesar, a recently-hired twenty-six 
              year old part-time private security guard who worked full-time for 
              Lockheed Aircraft, stood to Kennedy&#146;s right as the group passed 
              into the pantry. Cesar admitted to police that at the time of the 
              assassination, he was standing behind and in actual contact with 
              Senator Kennedy, and when the shooting began, he dropped down into 
              a crouching position and pulled out his gun.</b> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">This account puts Cesar (and not Sirhan) in position 
              to have shot Kennedy at close range with the upward angle by which 
              the Senator was struck three times. After gunfire had ceased, Cesar 
              advanced on Sirhan with his gun drawn, but Rosie Grier ordered him 
              to put it away. <br>
              Cesar falsely told police that he had sold his .22 revolver before 
              the crime, but a receipt proves that it was actually sold after 
              the crime. The LAPD never test fired Cesar&#146;s gun or asked to 
              see it even once Cesar admitted having been in position to have 
              fired the shots which struck RFK. The FBI was later told that the 
              gun had been stolen from the home of the person who purchased it 
              from Cesar. </font></p>

              crime scene. </b>One person who took photographs of the assassination 
              scene, 15-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060115012625/http://homepages.tcp.co.uk/%7Edlewis/enyart2.htm" target="_blank">Jamie 
              Scott Enyart</a>, was tackled and arrested at gunpoint by the LAPD. 
              His camera was seized and the film was never returned. In 1996, 
              Enyart won a substantial amount of money in a civil suit against 
              the LAPD in which he alleged the police department had willfully 
              misfiled and then destroyed his photographs along with 2400 other 
              assassination-related photos in an L.A. County Hospital incinerator 
              in 1968. </font></p>

            <p><font size="2"><b>Sirhan was seen with two other people before 
              the assassination who later were heard shouting &#147;We shot him!&#148;</b> 
              Two witnesses, waiter Vincent Di Pierro and campaign worker Sandra 
              Serrano, had seen Sirhan earlier in the evening hanging out with 
              a guy and a girl. While taking in some fresh air on outdoor steps 
              that lead up to the Embassy Ballroom, Sandra Serrano saw the group 
              of three ascend the steps at about 11:30 p.m. Di Pierro says he 
              noticed Sirhan standing by the tray table prior to the shooting 
              because Sirhan was talking to an attractive girl in a polka dot 
              dress. After the shooting, according to Serrano and another couple, 
              the girl and guy (minus Sirhan) came back down the steps proclaiming 
              &#147;We shot Kennedy!&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Sgt. Paul Sharaga, the first police officer on the 
              scene, soon filed a report saying witnesses had seen a young man 
              and a woman in a purple and white polka dot dress running out of 
              the hotel shouting &#147;We shot him! We shot him!&#148; He put 
              out an All Points Bulletin on these two suspects, but LAPD higher-ups 
              later cancelled this search. In fact, within minutes of the shooting, 
              Sirhan Sirhan was the sole suspect. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">During the police investigation, Special Unit Senator 
              (SUS), the LAPD&#146;s sole polygraph operator, Sgt. Enrique &#147;Hank&#148; 
              Hernandez, did intensive interviews with Serrano trying to convince 
              her that she did not hear anyone say &#147;We shot him!&#148; Transcripts 
              show lie detector expert Hernandez badgering Serrano to renounce 
              the testimony, saying she is &#147;shaming Senator Kennedy&#148; 
              by keeping up with her story that the couple had said &#147;We shot 
              Kennedy!&#148; But an agitated Serrano responds that &#147;That&#146;s 
              what I heard!&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">In the end, Manuel Pena, head of the SUS investigation 
              insisted that witnesses misheard the couple, who had only said &#147;They 
              shot him!&#148; The polka dot dress story was dismissed.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2"><b>Witnesses in the pantry saw other men with guns 
              besides Sirhan Sirhan and Eugene Cesar. </b>High school student 
              Lisa Urso noticed a blond man in a gray suit putting a gun back 
              in a holster, and a second witness saw a dark-haired man in a black 
              suit (likely identified as Michael Wayne) fire two shots and then 
              run out of the room.</font></p>

              <font size="3"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conclusion</font></b></font></font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Sirhan&#146;s current attorney, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060115012625/http://www.reopenrfkassassinationcase.com/" target="_blank">Lawrence 
              Teeter</a>, is pushing for a California Supreme Court &#147;evidentiary 
              hearing&#148; to show physical evidence which could exonerate Sirhan 
              of the assassination. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Teeter&#146;s main contention is that the L.A. County 
              autopsy of Robert Kennedy, conducted by Thomas Noguchi, confirms 
              that the Senator was shot three times from behind and mortally wounded 
              by one bullet to the back of the head. This bullet entered Kennedy&#146;s 
              brain from right behind his right ear, and was fired from less than 
              two inches from his head. The fact that the shot was point blank 
              is proven by &#147;powder burns&#148; around the wound which only 
              occur when a firearm is fewer than 3 inches from the target. Kennedy&#146;s 
              other wounds, to his shoulder and under his right armpit, were also 
              angled from behind (a fourth shot from behind went through Kennedy&#146;s 
              suit without piercing skin). </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Sirhan Sirhan was spotted firing an eight-round 
              Ivar Johnson handgun at Sen. Kennedy from 2-5 feet in front of the 
              presidential candidate, before being tackled by members of Kennedy&#146;s 
              entourage. Sirhan stood several feet in front of Kennedy, while 
              all of Kennedy&#146;s wounds were from a gun fired from behind him. 
              So how could Sirhan have shot Kennedy even once?</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Teeter also argues that physical evidence of the 
              total number of bullets fired in the pantry proves that there was 
              at least one other gunman in the pantry. At the end of the bloody 
              melee, six people were shot (Kennedy was the only person who would 
              die), and there were bullet holes in ceiling panels, doors, and 
              doorjambs. Sirhan&#146;s gun could hold eight bullets, but by counting 
              the number of wounded and stray bullet holes around, there was evidence 
              of at least ten bullets fired, and possibly more. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Teeter opposes demolition of the Ambassador Hotel 
              because this represents destruction of vital evidence to his client. 
              Although a lot of evidence was destroyed by the LAPD before and 
              after Sirhan&#146;s conviction, Teeter believes remaining evidence 
              of bullet holes in the walls and ceilings of the pantry area could 
              be analyzed for further proof that another gunman fired shots at 
              the Senator, and in a real position to murder Kennedy. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">The LAUSD&#146;s Heritage K-12 plan calls for creation 
              of a &#147;five-member commission of presidential scholars to advise 
              the school district on the appropriate treatment of the kitchen 
              pantry&#148; where Senator Robert F. Kennedy was murdered. LAUSD 
              Superintendant Roy Romer has acknowledged that because the entire 
              hotel building will be demolished, the pantry would have to be &#147;containerized 
              for possible re-creation and reinstallment in a new building.&#148; 
              Members of the Kennedy clan have publicly stated that they want 
              the pantry/corridor to be demolished with the rest of the building 
              and that preservation would be &#147;ghoulish.&#148; <br>
