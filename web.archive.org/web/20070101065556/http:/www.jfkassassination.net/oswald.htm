<h1>LEE HARVEY OSWALD</h1>
<blockquote><em>. . . if you put the murdered President of the United States on one side of a scale and that wretched waif Oswald on the other side, it doesn't balance.  You want to add something weightier to Oswald.  It would invest the President's death with meaning, endowing him with martyrdom.  He would have died for something. . . . 
A conspiracy would, of course, do the job nicely.</em>  &#151; William Manchester.</blockquote>

<font size="+2"> A</font>n historical enigma, Lee Harvey Oswald is at the center of the assassination, regardless of whether you consider him the lone gunman, a coconspirator who was also a patsy, or totally innocent.
<p>
 Oswald had a vastly unstable childhood.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oswald1.htm">The Oswald Timeline - I</a>, gives the details of his frequent moves and changes of school.

 What about Oswald's adult life?

<h3>Lee Oswald: Troubled Youth</h3>
<p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556im_/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oball.gif" width="20" height="15"> The whole lone assassin case hangs on the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sort of disturbed individual who might have shot the president.  If he was, what were the roots of his psychological problems?  Oswald's  chronic truancy after he and his mother moved to New York in 1952 landed him in Youth House, a facility for troubled teenagers.  There professionals on the staff conducted a thorough examination of him.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/troubled.htm">"Lee Oswald: Troubled Youth"</a> is the Warren Commission's summary of what they found.

<h3>Oswald's Defection to the USSR</h3>

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556im_/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oball.gif" width="20" height="15"> The circumstances of Oswald's defection to the USSR, and his time in Moscow are covered in detail, and with interesting new sources, on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald-in-russia.htm">"Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia" web site</a> run by Peter Wronski.

<h3 id="suspicious">"Suspicious" Happenings in Oswald's Life</h3>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556im_/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oball.gif" width="20" height="15"> Conspiracy authors specialize in finding "spooky" or "suspicious" happenings in the life of Lee Oswald &#151; happenings that supposedly reveal some sinister connection with a government agency or other group of possible assassination conspirators.  

<ul type="circle">
<li>Some of the employees at Oswald's place of work in New Orleans, the Reily Coffee Company, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/cadet.htm">left to take jobs at a nearby NASA facility</a>.
<li>Lee and Maria Oswald, when they returned from the USSR to the Dallas/Fort Worth area, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/luggage.htm">supposedly lost some of their luggage</a>.
<li>In the Marines, Lee Oswald got gonorrhea in a manner the Marines ruled "in the line of duty . . . not due to own misconduct."  Does this imply that Oswald was, for example, sleeping with prostitutes on orders from some intelligence agency?  Mark Zaid, a JFK assassination researcher and a lawyer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/vd.htm">looked into this legal determination</a>.
<li>Conspiracy authors have exploited the Warren Commission's inability to explain how Lee Oswald &#151; during his defection to the USSR &#151; got from London to Helsinki to suggest some sinister intelligence plot afoot.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/fancy2.txt">Author Chris Mills' research</a> on the topic reveals a simple solution to the puzzle &#151; one the Warren Commission should have produced.
<li>Conspiracy books often claim that Oswald had "Top Secret" or even
"crypto" security clearance, which supposedly indicates some sinister 
connection to some intelligence agency.  The House Select Committee on Assassinations got to the bottom of this issue.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oswald5.txt">Here is their report</a>
<li>On the streets of New Orleans, Oswald got into a violent confrontation with anti-Castro activists.  Conspiracy books will tell you that a police officer said the confrontation was "staged," implying that Oswald was in league with the activists.  Read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/martello.txt">the actual testimony</a> and see what the officer (Francis Martello) actually said.
</ul>


<h3 id="motive">Why'd He Do It?</h3>

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556im_/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oball.gif" width="20" height="15"> There is no way an examination of Lee Oswald's character and personality can prove he was the lone assassin.  Prove that he was a malcontent loner, and you've only proved that he was the perfect patsy for some conspiracy.  Prove that he was enamoured of spy games and false identities, and you simply open the possibility that real intelligence operatives suckered him into a game that cost him his life.
<p>
But people do have a right to demand that lone gunman theorists provide a <i>plausible</i> account of how malcontent Oswald might have chosen to kill Kennedy.   Starting with the <i>Warren Commission Report</i>, and continuing with books like Jean Davison's <i>Oswald's Game</i>, they have indeed done so.  
<p>
Two essays on this site address these issues.<ul><li>Jerry Organ is a lone assassin theorist who believes that Oswald was indeed willing to kill for political reasons, as he argues in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/organ1.htm">"The Oswald Agenda"</a>.
<li>Mel Ayton, while giving due weight to Oswald's leftist politics, provides an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/motives.htm">especially incisive discussion of the personal motives</a> that drove Oswald.  Ayton analyzes the claimed assassin within the framework of a classic psychological study of pathological murderers -- one published before the Kennedy assassination (which is important, since it could not in any way have been slanted or biased to implicate Oswald).</ul>


<h3 id="photos">Are the Backyard Photos Genuine?</h3>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556im_/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oball.gif" width="20" height="15"> The HSCA analysis of the famous Oswald backyard photos.  If you're 
used to reading the likes of Jack White on this subject, you'll find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/photos.txt">this analysis</a> a revelation.


<h3 id="sightings">Oswald "Sightings"</h3>
<p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556im_/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oball.gif" width="20" height="15">  Conspiracy books list large numbers of witnesses who saw Lee Oswald in all sorts of places the Warren Commission said he wasn't:  in the Carousel Club, on a shooting range, talking to "Maurice Bishop," visiting Silvia Odio.  Just how seriously should these witness accounts be taken?  Are they the evidence that blows the lid off the coverup, or are they just like claims of people who saw Elvis at the Laundromat?  In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/sightings.txt">this section of the <em>Warren Commission Report</em></a>, the Commission investigates several of these claims.
<p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556im_/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oball.gif" width="20" height="15">  And here is a late 1950's picture of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/herbert.jpg">Ray Herbert of the Chicago White Sox</a>.  "What," you may be asking, "is the point?"  Look at the photo and ask yourself:  "How many guys who looked a lot like Oswald were running around in 1963, easily misidentified as our boy Lee?" Cecil Jones discovered this photo.
<p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556im_/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oball.gif" width="20" height="15">  One "sighting" was that of Silvia Odio, who was convinced that Lee Oswald was at her house in Dallas in September of 1963, in the company of two anti-Castro Cubans.  He supposedly threatened to kill Kennedy.  After an extensive search, the FBI identified the "Oswald" character as one William Seymour.  Here is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/images/Seymour.jpg">one photo of Seymour</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/images/Seymour1.jpg">here is another</a>. Although certainly not an "Oswald look-alike," neither was Seymour grossly different.  Denis Morissette kindly supplied these photos.
<p>
The FBI's identification was thrown into doubt when the source of the identification, one Loran Eugene Hall, recanted.  Yet FBI agent James Hosty (see below) believes that Seymour was the man Odio mistook for Oswald.  In an interview with Steve Bochan he said:

<blockquote>
Now, I believe that she believes that she saw Oswald.  But
I'm convinced that the story that we finally came up with
about Seymour, is who she saw who looked somewhat like
Oswald.  Now Loran Hall . . . was the one that
said yes, we were up there.  Now we can prove that Loran
Hall and [Seymour and Howard] were in Dallas
at the time.  I think they were arrested or stopped or
questioned or something.  So they were definitely there. 
. . . . And, after Loran
Hall told us this, Seymour and Howard jumped all over him
because see, what he in effect had done, he had told us that
Seymour had committed a violation of law.  It is a violation
to threaten to kill the president.  And the Secret Service
could have arrested him.  So they put pressure on him and he
changed his story.  (Source:  Interview with Steve Bochan, 11/21/96)

<p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556im_/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oball.gif" width="20" height="15">  The Walker assassination attempt is an extremely important 
incident, judged by both the Warren Commission and by the House Select 
Committee to indicate Oswald's propensity for violence.  How strong is 
the evidence against Oswald?  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/walker.txt">This section of the Warren Commission Report</a>  deals with this incident.  If Oswald shot at Walker, it is 
extremely easy to believe that he shot at Kennedy seven months later.
<p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556im_/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oball.gif" width="20" height="15"> Conspiracy books try to attack the Warren Commission version of the Walker shooting by citing a witness, Walter Coleman, who supposedly saw <em>two</em> men fleeing the scene.  Read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/coleman.txt">the FBI report of Coleman's testimony</a>, and see whether it in any way challenges the Commission's version.

A recurring theory has been that there were "two Oswalds" &#151; one the birth Lee Harvey Oswald, and another a look-alike substituted for the real Lee Oswald by some sinister people for some sinister reason. And authors pushing this theory can produce considerable "evidence" to support it.  But just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/2oswalds.htm">how well does this "evidence" fare under critical scrutiny?</a>

<p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556im_/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oball.gif" width="20" height="15"> If Oswald was in fact a Marxist, conspiracy theorists often ask, why did he not proclaim himself to be JFK's killer, and proudy declare his political beliefs?  The answer lies in the value of the "Victim Game," something that since the late 60s we have heard from minorities wanting the benefit of affirmative action programs, from militia types claiming Federal persecution, and indeed from all sorts of groups.  But the Old Left pioneered the Victim Game, and Oswald's mother headed Lee in that direction even before he became a leftist.   Russ Burr explains this recurring factor in Lee's behavior in his brief essay "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/patsy.htm">I'm Just a Patsy</a>."


<h3 id="custody">Was the Evidence Against Oswald "Inadmissible"</h3>
<p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556im_/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oball.gif" width="20" height="15">  Conspiracy books attack the evidence against Oswald by claiming that the "chain of custody" was broken for most of it, and that only marking evidence is sufficient to establish a "chain of custody" for legal purposes.  This<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/custody.txt"> legal brief submitted by the plaintiffs in the O. J. Simpson civil trial</a> shows this claim to be untrue.   All the key pieces of evidence (the rifle, the hulls in the
Depository, the hulls at 10th and Patton, materials from Oswald's rooming house
and from the Paines' house in Irving) would have been legally admissible. 


<h3 id="counsel">Was Oswald "Denied Counsel?"</h3>
<p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556im_/http://www.jfkassassination.net/oball.gif" width="20" height="15">  
A common theme in conspiracy books is that Oswald was "denied counsel" when in the custody of the Dallas Police.  The real story is more complex, and tells us a lot about just how Lee Oswald thought.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/defense.txt">Oswald, in His Own Defense</a>, an essay by Joel Grant and John Locke, explores this issue.

To understand the assassination a necessary &#151; but alas, not sufficient &#151; requirement is that you understand Lee Oswald.  To believe the lone assassin theory you have to conclude that here was a man who in fact <em>could</em> have shot John Kennedy in cold blood.  Of course, concluding that Oswald was this sort of man doesn't rule out a conspiracy.  Intelligent conspirators would certainly frame a man who looked capable of being the lone gunman.  But even if Oswald did it by himself, were his motives mainly personal, or political?  We can start to examine the theory of Oswald the political assassin by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/ownwords.htm">looking at his own writings</a>.  Was this man capable of killing to achieve a political objective?

Never mind that he was in New Orleans all this time, the story has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065556/http://www.jfkassassination.net/bishop.txt">other massive credibility problems</a>, as the HSCA investigation made clear.

But Lee's wife Marina told the intimate details of their sex life to Priscilla McMillan, and the KGB spied on Lee and Marina's Minsk apartment round-the-clock.  It's clear that Lee was heterosexual, and the CIA document and the way conspiracy authors have interpreted it tell us more about them than about Lee's sex life.

Conspiracy authors have attacked this testimony, pointing out that Marina was a recent immigrant to the United States, was fearful of the authorities, and spoke English very poorly.<p>
These criticisms are well taken, but they don't apply to her testimony before the House Select Committee on Assassinations. 
<p>
The following is from Volume II of the Hearings of the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, pp. 301-302.  Due to remarriage, Marina is "Mrs. Porter" here. The testimony was given
on September 14, 1978.  Note her endorsement of Priscilla Johnson McMillan's
<em>Marina and Lee</em> as an accurate account.

<blockquote>
<p>
<font size="-1">     Chairman STOKES. Now again you know Priscilla Johnson
McMillan, don't you?
<p>
     Mrs. PORTER. Yes, sir.
<p>
     Chairman STOKES. That is the lady who wrote the book
"Marina and Lee."
<p>
     Mrs. PORTER. Yes.
<p>
     Chairman STOKES. And you talked with her with reference
to what she was writing about the book, didn't you? 
<p>
     Mrs. PORTER. Sure.
<p>
     Chairman STOKES. You have read that book? 
<p>
     Mrs. PORTER. Yes; not recently but a year ago. 
<p>
     Chairman STOKES. I beg your pardon? 
<p>
     Mrs. PORTER. A year ago, yes. 
<p>
     Chairman STOKES. A year ago, right.
<p>
     Let me read this passage to you from the book. I am
reading at page 436.
<p>
     "Marina was now certain that Lee was guilty. She saw his
guilt in his eyes. Moreover, she knew that had he been
innocent, he would have been screaming to high heaven for
his rights, claiming he had been mistreated, and demanding
to see officials at the very highest levels, just as he had
always done before. For her, the fact that he was so
compliant, that he told her he was being treated all right,
was a sign that he was guilty."
<p>
     Did you tell Miss Johnson that? 
<p>
     Mrs. PORTER. Yes.
<p>
     Chairman STOKES. Now in addition to it, you told Miss
Johnson, did you not, about the police coming and taking
away many possessions, and one of the possessions that they
left was a small demitasse cup, and when you looked and
discovered the fact that they had not taken the cup, you
also found in there Lee's wedding ring. Did you tell her
about that?
<p>
     Mrs. PORTER. Well, I do not &#151; I remember the demitasse,
but it is missed. I don't know where it is.
<p>
     Are you asking me did I find Lee's ring? 
<p>
     Chairman STOKES. Did you find his ring? 
<p>
     Mrs. PORTER. Yes, sir.
<p>                                      
     Chairman STOKES. And then did you tell Miss Johnson
this:
<p>
     "'Oh, no,' she thought, and her heart sank again, 'Lee
never took his ring off, not even on his grimiest manual
jobs.'  She had seen him wearing it the night before. Marina
suddenly realized what it meant.  Lee had not just gone out
and shot the President spontaneously. He had intended to do
it when he left for work that day. Again things were falling
into place. Marina told no one about Lee's ring."
<p>
     Did you tell Miss Johnson that? 
<p>
     Mrs. PORTER. Yes.
<p>
     Chairman STOKES. As my time has expired, the Chair
would request unanimous consent to proceed for 3 additional
minutes. Without objection. Now did you tell &#151;
<p>
     Mr. FAUNTROY. Overruled, Mr. Chairman. 
<p>
     Chairman STOKES. That is democracy.
<p>
     Mrs. Porter, it has always been important for the
American people to ascribe some motive to this killing. And
I notice further that, in the same book, Miss Johnson writes
this, and I am reading at page 434 of the book:
<p>
     "In his eyes, his political ideas stood higher even than
himself. He would talk about Marxism, Communism, and
injustice all over the world."
<p>
     Did you tell Miss Johnson that?
<p>
     Mrs. PORTER. That was Miss Johnson's conclusion about
studying Lee as a person. Her findings weren't based only on
what I told her. She did great research and met with lots of
people who knew Lee. That was her conclusion, and I agree
with her.</font>
