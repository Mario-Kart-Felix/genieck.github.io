<h2 align="center">Jung and the Nazis </h2>

<p>It is difficult to deny that Carl Jung's theories are largely overlooked in comparison
to Freudian and other schools of thought. There are numerous possible reasons for such an
occurrence but the most intriguing of all are accusations of anti-Semitism and
National-Socialist support in the 1930's. Having been accused of such, and facing the
associated stigma of scandalous behavior and beliefs may very well be the reason behind
Jung's unpopularity. His relationship with Sigmund Freud, his written work on Jewry, his
fascination with the Nazi movement, and the allegation of Nazi sympathy in general, seem
damaging to say the least. An examination of Jung and his work during the period leading
up to and through World War Two sheds greater light on such long-standing accusations and
goes a long way toward dispelling these claims. </p>

<h2>Nazi Sympathizer</h2>

<p>Like many others, Jung initially welcomed the focus of unity that swept across the
German land as the National-Socialist &quot;revolution&quot; took hold (Stern, 1976).
Though as time went on and Jung grew increasingly cautious in his views, accusations of
being a &quot;Nazi sympathizer&quot; emerged; accusations which, in some respects, seems
justified as we will see. </p>

<p>In 1928, Carl Gustav Jung became a member of the International General Medical Society
for Psychotherapy (Gallard, 1994). This society, which began two years earlier, was
founded on the desire to develop a psychotherapeutic science with a spiritual, rather than
widely popular material, emphasis. In the same year that Jung joined the society, so too
did Matthias Heinrich Goring, the cousin of the now infamous Marshall, Herman Goring. Jung
was elected vice president in 1930 and was asked to assume the presidency in 1933 due to
the deteriorating political climate. It was believed that Jung, being a Swiss National and
thus neutral, would be in a better political position to handle the role (Gallard, 1994). </p>

<p>Later that year, there was a reorganization of Zentralblatt fur Psychotherapie, the
society's publication journal. The decision was made that two separate but aligned
editions of the journal would be published: an international edition edited by Jung, and a
German edition under the control of Goring for the purpose of ensuring that all material
conformed to Nazi ideology (Sherry, 1986). It was soon after recommended by Goring that
every practicing psychotherapist adopt Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf as a basic reference.
This written appeal was slated for publication in the German edition of the journal but
somehow ended up in the international journal above Carl Jung's signature (Gallard, 1994;
Sherry, 1986). Though the society's headquarters were located in Switzerland and he was
certainly far removed from this &quot;Nazi deception,&quot; it was a commonly held belief
that Jung accepted the presidency of a Nazified German organization; thus he must be a
sympathizer. </p>

<p>His decision to accept such a position was heavily criticized by many. Perhaps the fact
that Jung fantasized of national glory, was purportedly not immune to the lure of power,
and felt neglected and misunderstood, played a role in his acceptance of the presidency
for a society in which some members were almost certainly familiar with Mein Kampf and
Nazi ideology (Stern, 1976). Jung, however, offered the excuse that he simply followed the
wishes of his German (and Jewish) colleagues; his true aim was to save psychotherapy which
could easily disappear, as he had put it, with a single stroke of the pen by higher
authorities (Gallard, 1994). He did initially doubt his decision from a moral standpoint
but the desire to preserve the interests of science made the risky effort worthwhile
(Gallard, 1994). In the end, Jung's professional reputation was certainly affected by
these events, though he seemed to have a blind spot to these ramifications. However, this
blind spot, some have suggested, also allowed Jung to see and clarify elements which went
previously undetected, out of which his fascination with events in Germany grew. </p>

<h2>Jung's Fascination </h2>

<p>Part of Jung's fascination with the Nazi movement was due to his belief that his
archetype theory was best able to explain the &quot;rumblings&quot; of pre-World War Two
Germany. He saw the Nazi movement as an enormous eruption of the collective unconscious he
had previously postulated as far back as 1918 (Stern, 1976). Jung believed the archetype
&quot;Wotan,&quot; which represented the German state of mind in the 1930's, was the
return of the collective repressed, and constituted a great event in light of the belief
that the Germans were experiencing a reintegration of archaic elements into their psyche
(elements that had been, over past centuries, suppressed by various cultural movements). </p>

<p>By 1936, Jung's excitement waned as he recognized (and clearly stated) the demonic
aspect of Hitler and the Nazi movement (Gallard, 1994). However, according to his
theories, there is an inherent duality of the archetype, leading Jung to the expectation
that the evil side would turn into its opposite, allowing these forces to humanize. Thus,
Jung believed a new and positive cultural form would emerge and remained hopeful (Gallard,
1994). Such hopefulness was frowned upon by those opposed to the Nazis but, as we will
later see, his medical profession may have accounted for his unpopular views. Despite
these events there were other damaging accusations. His relationship with Freud, it has
been suggested, represented a darker side to Jung's Jewish attitudes. </p>

<h2>Jung and Freud</h2>

<p>The anti-Semitism charges in the 1930's were dismissed as having been started by a
vengeful Sigmund Freud in order to discredit Jung's work (Sherry, 1986). These
accusations, however, were continually repeated by Freudians and stuck with Jung wherever
he went. It is true that a superficial glance of Jung's attitude concerning Freudian
psychology seems frighteningly similar to Nazi phraseology. Jung referred to the Freudian
school of thought as subversive, depreciatory, undermining, obscene, and smutty-minded,
while the Nazis described Jews as alien, subversive, lascivious, and parasitic (Stern,
1976). His statements may have sounded anti-Semitic but Stern (1976) proposes they were
more correctly attributable to the resentment that periodically overcame him; he may have
overshot his initial target, which was undoubtedly Sigmund Freud (Stern, 1976). These
anti-Semitic accusations by Freudians, Jung warned, were a confirmation that
psychoanalysis was a Jewish psychology (Sherry, 1986). It seemed that no one, without
facing charges of anti-Semitism, could criticize Freud's work. Did Jung's resentment of
Freud arise because he was anti-Semitic? It is more likely that this tension between the
two grew out of their necessary separation as coworkers and colleagues. </p>

<p>It is true that Jung had a conflictual relationship with a prominent Jew - Sigmund
Freud. It was Freud, however, who first emphasized cultural and religious differences
between the two (Gallard, 1994). What originally brought Freud and Jung together was their
common belief that the unconscious was a reality. In the end, however, the separation of
the two collaborators was necessary because of different fundamental views that could not
be reconciled: Freud concentrated on the physical and biological background of the
unconscious, while Jung conceptualized the psyche in terms of polarities (Franz, 1975). </p>

<p>Jung believed that both the biological as well as the spiritual aspects belonged to the
very nature of the unconscious. In later years, Jung explained the separation as a
typological difference in temperament (Franz, 1975). Freud's work corresponded to an
extroverted approach to science while Jung's methods were more of an introverted concern.
It is clear that differences between the two were at a fundamental, structural level
rather than racially or religiously based. In a 1929 text, Jung contrasted their two
theories and no mention was ever made of Freud's religious origins (Gallard, 1994). In
1939, Jung spoke about Freud after the eminent thinkers death and again made no mention of
religious or racial differences, though the time in history would have been an opportune
moment to do so, considering the rise of the Nazi movement and the general feeling of
dislike toward the Jews in Germany. In Jung's own words, &quot;I am absolutely not an
opponent of the Jews, even though I am an opponent of Freud's. I criticize him because of
his materialistic and intellectualistic - last but not least - irreligious attitude and
not because he is Jewish&quot; (Jung, 1934b, as cited in Gallard, 1994, p. 218). </p>

<p>To this day, the two schools of thought are opposed to each other. This opposition
probably resides in the typological differences alluded to by Jung. The Freudian outlook
is much closer to the extroverted orientation of our Natural Sciences while Jung's
approach is of a more subjective nature (Franz, 1975). Whether one is satisfied that he
was an opponent of Freud because of professional and not religious differences, Jung was
also accused of writing, throughout the 1930's, what some consider to be anti-Semitic
statements about Jews in general. </p>

<h2>Jung and Jewish Psychology</h2>

<p>In the very first issue of the <em>Zentralblatt fur Psychotherapie</em>, with Jung as
editor, he wrote that the universal aspect of the psyche should not be allowed to hide the
particular characteristics that are evident from belonging to any given cultural or
religious group. In fact, Jung touched on this topic - differences between Jewish and
Germanic psychology - on many occasions which highlights his &quot;concern to give voice
to those viewpoints which report on the 'imponderable differences' between men, and by
exposing them, to reach a synthesis&quot; (Gallard, 1994, p. 209). Such may be the case,
but Jung's emphasis on religious and cultural differences of the psyche was a serious
breach of ethics in consideration of the time in history (Gallard, 1994). To accentuate
such differences between Jewish psychology and other schools of thought fed into Nazi
propaganda. </p>

<p>Furthermore, Jung continually failed to explain exactly what he meant by his oftentimes
paradoxical writing, thus leaving him open to criticism. In light of this, the accusations
of ant-Semitism seem hardly surprising. As an example of paradoxical writing, Jung, at one
point, likened Jewish psychology to Chinese psychology. At that time in history however,
the Chinese culture was not well known; they were a remote people, not valued by others,
and were of an entirely different cultural realm (Gallard, 1994). It is not surprising
that such an idea could be taken as a further attack on Jews. Yet unknown to most, Jung
had spent years immersing himself in Far Eastern culture and found somewhat of an
authentication of his ideas. His great respect for the Chinese culture implies that he was
complimenting Jewish psychology. In fact, at one point, he stated that Jews were more
vastly conscious than the barbaric Germanic people and had a higher degree of civilization
and adaptability (McGuire, &amp; Hull, 1977). </p>

<p>In relation to such differences that Jung so eagerly emphasized, it was his belief that
the cultural specificities were the universal heritage of humankind which can be found in
all people (Gallard, 1994). However, an effort must first be made to recognize these
particulars which usually show themselves as differences. This notion would explain why
Jung was so intent on highlighting differences between Jewish and Germanic psychology: he
simply wished to initiate discussion on, what many considered, sensitive matters (Sherry,
1986). Though some would later suggest that through addressing Jewish psychological
differences, he was really unconsciously addressing Freud, it is clear that he failed to
understand the possibility of misinterpretation and the dangerous misuse of what he wrote.
If Jung could be accused of anything, it would be his poor timing in light of the events
unfolding around him in pre-war Europe. </p>

<p>Having considered these accusations - of being a Nazi sympathizer and anti-Semite - it
is worth considering often overlooked public statements expressed by Jung as the war
approached. </p>

<h2>Jung's Own Words</h2>

<p>As early as 1918, Jung knew something unfavorable was arising within Germany. His words
of the &quot;blond beast stirring in its subterranean prison...threatening us with an
outbreak that will have devastating consequences&quot; (Jung, 1947, as cited in Welsh,
Hannah, &amp; Briner, 1947) serve as an early warning of what was to come. Just ten years
later, he wrote on how each person is unconsciously worse when acting within a crowd
rather than individually. Jung warned the world that the larger an organization becomes,
the more the people are prone to immorality and blind ignorance (Jung, 1947, as cited in
Welsh, Hannah, &amp; Briner, 1947). </p>

<p>In 1933, in a lecture given in Cologne, Germany (at the same period in history when
others accused him of Nazi-sympathy), Jung leveled a full blown warning about people as a
collective suffocating the individual, leaving those in the crowd anonymous,
irresponsible, and dangerous. Jung implied that Hitler (and Nazism) was the inevitable
cause of such collectivenes. Four years later, in 1937, Jung spoke at Yale University in
the United States, relaying his belief that the movement seen in Germany was explained by
a fear of neighboring countries supposedly possessed by devilish leaders. In stating that
no one can recognize their own unconscious underpinnings, the possibility that Germany was
projecting their own condition upon their International neighbors was evident (Jung, 1947,
as cited in Welsh, Hannah, &amp; Briner, 1947). This fear leads to the nationalistic duty
to have the biggest guns and the strongest army. </p>

<p>In 1940, most of these words were published in German but were quickly suppressed. As a
result of Jung's views about Germany and particularly Adolf Hitler, he ended up on the
Nazi &quot;blacklist&quot; (Jung, 1947, as cited in Welsh, Hannah, &amp; Briner, 1947).
When France was later invaded, the Gestapo destroyed Jung's French translations as well.
In no uncertain terms, Jung's writings and lectures served as a warning for the conflict
to come. As well, Jung's own words opposed the accusations of Nazi sympathy and
anti-Semitism. It would seem then, in light of the above, that the answer to the question
of Nazi sympathy and anti-Semitism is fairly clear. </p>

<h2>Conlusions</h2>

<p>Was Jung a Nazi sympathizer and ant-Semite? The answer is most likely no. Jay Sherry
(1986) suggests that Jung's bitterness toward Freud as well as his fascination with his
archetype theory coming to life caused him to miss, on a feeling level, what was unfolding
in a historical sense. Jung clearly showed the importance he placed on mythical symbols
and transformations, and his choice to describe events psychically (in mythological terms)
rather than from a psychiatric or sociological standpoint may have obscured his view of
his predicament (Gallard, 1994). As well, his initial enthusiasm about the Nazi movement
was likely a result of the polarity of his theory. If each archetype contains the seeds of
good as well as evil, it is difficult at the start to judge whether a positive or negative
resolution will take place. His medical background may have counseled him to a &quot;wait
and see&quot; attitude in light of this polarity (Jung, 1947, as cited in Welsh, Hannah,
&amp; Briner, 1947). Jung stated that, &quot;a doctor needs a certain optimism in order to
save everything that can possibly be saved, even when things look very black. One simply
cannot afford to let oneself be too much impressed by the apparent or real hopelessness of
a situation, even though this should entail exposing oneself to a certain danger&quot;
(Jung, 1947, as cited in Welsh, Hannah, &amp; Briner, 1947). This attitude leaves no room
for initial negative judgments, but leads one to proceed cautiously and optimistically.
This would account for the numerous accusations that Jung possessed an initial
give-them-a-chance attitude toward Hitler and the Nazi movement (Sherry, 1986). </p>

<p>One should also keep in mind that, from Jung's standpoint, pre-National-Socialist
Germany was one of the most differentiated cultural countries in the world, and
represented the intellectual background to which the Swiss were tied through language and
friendship (Jung, 1947, as cited in Welsh, Hannah, &amp; Briner, 1947). Jung admits that,
as Hitler seized power, he consoled himself in the fact that Germany was indeed a
civilized European nation with a strong sense of discipline and morality. Thus, to Jung
(as well as countless others), the ultimate outcome seemed confusing and uncertain (Jung,
1947, as cited in Welsh, Hannah, &amp; Briner, 1957). </p>

<p>Finally, Marie Louise von Franz (1975) knew Jung up to his death and never perceived
the slightest trace, conscious or unconscious, of National-Socialist or anti-Semitic
support. To the contrary, she states that Jung frequently spoke against Hitler and the
Nazis in distinctly unambiguous terms. The fact that some of his most devoted pupils -
Erich Neumann, Gerhard Adler, James Kirsch, and Aniela Jaffe - were Jewish and that racism
was quite contrary to Jung's well known aspirations of universality suggests the
accusations are somewhat misguided (Stern, 1976). As a result of these insights, it is
best to infer that Jung's misplaced optimism and the mistake of talking too much proves
the truism that &quot;a great scientist is not necessarily a good politician&quot; (Franz,
1975, p. 63). </p>
