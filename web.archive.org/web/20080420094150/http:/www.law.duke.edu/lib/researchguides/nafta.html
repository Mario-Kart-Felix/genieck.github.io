<h3><a id="introduction" name="introduction"></a>I. Introduction</h3>
<p>The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was implemented on January 1, 1994. It is designed to remove tariff barriers between the U.S., Canada and Mexico over the next fifteen years. NAFTA includes two important side agreements on environmental and labor issues that extend into cooperative efforts to reconcile policies, and procedures for dispute resolution between the member states. NAFTA is known in French as ALENA (Accord de libre-échange nord américain), and in Spanish as TLC (Tratado de libre comercio) or TLCAN (Tratado de libre comercio de américa del norte).</p>
<p>NAFTA was preceded by an agreement between Canada and the United States called the U.S-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (FTA) which was effective on January 1, 1989, and is now suspended due to NAFTA.</p>

<h3><a id="dispute" name="dispute"></a>IV. Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>NAFTA’s dispute resolution mechanism includes provisions for panels to settle disputes. The NAFTASecretariat administers the dispute settlement procedure. Its web site &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080420094150/http://www.nafta-sec-alena.org/">http://www.nafta-sec-alena.org</a>&gt; contains panel decisions (for both the NAFTA and the FTA), the Code of Conduct for dispute settlement, rules of procedure for panels, information on the status of panels and a roster of panel members. NAFTALAW.ORG &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080420094150/http://www.naftaclaims.com/">http://www.naftaclaims.com/</a>&gt;is a good source of information about the NAFTA dispute settlement process; it includes copies of recent NAFTA Claim documents.</p>
<p>Panel decisions under NAFTA (and under the U.S.-Canada Free-Trade Agreement) are published in <em>North American Free Trade Agreements</em> (KDZ944.A41992 L39 1992). They are also available in Lexis (Short Name INTLAW;NAFDEC) and Westlaw (NAFTA-BIP database). Worldtradelaw.net (&lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080420094150/http://library.duke.edu/metasearch/db/id/DUK00934">http://library.duke.edu/metasearch/db/id/DUK00934</a>&gt; for off-campus access) includes Chapter 20 arbitral panel reports &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080420094150/http://www.law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/%3chttp://www.worldtradelaw.net/nafta20/index.htm%3e">http://www.worldtradelaw.net/nafta20/index.htm&gt;</a>, with summaries and analyses &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080420094150/http://www.law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/%3chttp://www.worldtradelaw.net/dsc/main.htm%3e">http://www.worldtradelaw.net/dsc/main.htm&gt;</a> and links to selected government submissions in NAFTA Chapter 11 disputes &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080420094150/http://www.worldtradelaw.net/submissions.htm%3e.The">www.worldtradelaw.net/submissions.htm&gt;.</a> The U.S. Department of State <em>NAFTA Investor-State Arbitrations</em> website &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080420094150/http://www.law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/%3chttp://www.state.gov/s/l/c3439.htm%3e">http://www.state.gov/s/l/c3439.htm&gt;</a> contains expropriation and other international investment disputes between North American investors and the governments of Canada, Mexico or the U.S. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean's Integrated Database of Trade Disputes for Latin America and the Caribbean provides access to information and documentation on the trade dispute process for NAFTA and other regional trade organizations (MERCOSUR, CARICOM, etc.) &lt; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080420094150/http://idatd.eclac.cl/controversias/index_en.jsp">http://idatd.eclac.cl/controversias/index_en.jsp</a> &gt;.<br/>
<br/>
The <em>Handbook of NAFTA Dispute Settlement</em> (KDZ 944.F65) includes a description of NAFTA dispute procedures, cases decided under NAFTA and CFTA, and reprints of documents related to dispute resolution.</p>
<p>Meg N. Kinnear, Andrea K. Bjorklund &amp; John F.G. Hannaford, <em>Investment Disputes Under NAFTA: An Annotated Guide to NAFTA Chapter 11</em> (KDZ744 .K56) is designed to provide easy access to NAFTA Chapter 11 awards and commentary.<br/>
<br/>
Leon E. Trakman, <em>Dispute Settlement Under the NAFTA: Manual and Source Book</em> (KDZ 525 .T73 1997) explains the dispute resolution process and outlines activities of working groups and committees.</p>

<h3><a id="looseleaf" name="looseleaf"></a>V. Looseleaf Services</h3>
<p>BNA's <em>International Trade Reporter</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080420094150/http://library.duke.edu/metasearch/db/id/DUK02057">http://library.duke.edu/metasearch/db/id/DUK02057</a>; older print editions in Superseded Looseleaf) is an excellent tool to track NAFTA developments. The “Major Topics” of the <em>Current Reports</em> has a section about NAFTA and includes news about developments such as amendments, court decisions, etc. in Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>Another useful looseleaf service is a Canadian publication, <em>Accord de Libre-Échange entre le Canada et les États-Unis Annoté/Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the United States Annotated</em> (K 4609 .C3 1990; updated through January, 1996). It contains an annotated text (in French and English) with references to the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, the GATT, implementing legislation and committee reports and hearings from both the U.S. and Canada, judicial decisions, and books and articles as well. This is one of the best places to look for references to primary and secondary Canadian sources.</p>

<h3><a id="legislation" name="legislation"></a>VI. Legislation, Regulations and Legislative History</h3>
<p>The implementing legislation, known as the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, was passed in December, 1993 (Pub. L. No. 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057).</p>
<p>The <em>Federal Register</em> is the best place to find regulations implementing NAFTA from such agencies as the U.S. Customs Service and the International Trade Administration (Department of Commerce). There is a bibliography of <em>Federal Register</em> notices in <em>North American Free Trade Agreements</em> (KDZ 944 .A41992 L39 1992). Requests for Panel Review under the dispute resolution procedures also appear in the <em>Federal Register</em>.</p>
<p>There is an exhaustive legislative history of NAFTA which includes the texts of the agreement, chronologies, bibliographies, and some Spanish language documents: Bernard D. Reams and Jon S.
