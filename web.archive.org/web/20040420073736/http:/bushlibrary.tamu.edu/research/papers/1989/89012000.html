      <p><font size="+2">Inaugural Address </font> <br>
        <font size="+1"><i>January 20, 1989</i></font> </p>
      <p> Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Quayle, Senator Mitchell, 
        Speaker Wright, Senator Dole, Congressman Michel, and fellow citizens, 
        neighbors, and friends: 
      <p> There is a man here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts and 
        in our history. President Reagan, on behalf of our nation, I thank you 
        for the wonderful things that you have done for America. 
      <p> I've just repeated word for word the oath taken by George Washington 
        200 years ago, and the Bible on which I placed my hand is the Bible on 
        which he placed his. It is right that the memory of Washington be with 
        us today not only because this is our bicentennial inauguration but because 
        Washington remains the Father of our Country. And he would, I think, be 
        gladdened by this day; for today is the concrete expression of a stunning 
        fact: our continuity, these 200 years, since our government began. 
      <p> We meet on democracy's front porch. A good place to talk as neighbors 
        and as friends. For this is a day when our nation is made whole, when 
        our differences, for a moment, are suspended. And my first act as President 
        is a prayer. I ask you to bow your heads. 
      <p> Heavenly Father, we bow our heads and thank You for Your love. Accept 
        our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that 
        makes its continuance likely. Make us strong to do Your work, willing 
        to heed and hear Your will, and write on our hearts these words: ``Use 
        power to help people.'' For we are given power not to advance our own 
        purposes, nor to make a great show in the world, nor a name. There is 
        but one just use of power, and it is to serve people. Help us remember, 
        Lord. Amen. 
      <p> I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise. 
        We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better. For 
        a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn. 
        For in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over. The 
        totalitarian era is passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from 
        an ancient, lifeless tree. A new breeze is blowing, and a nation refreshed 
        by freedom stands ready to push on. There is new ground to be broken and 
        new action to be taken. There are times when the future seems thick as 
        a fog; you sit and wait, hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right 
        path. But this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right 
        through into a room called tomorrow. 
      <p> Great nations of the world are moving toward democracy through the door 
        to freedom. Men and women of the world move toward free markets through 
        the door to prosperity. The people of the world agitate for free expression 
        and free thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions 
        that only liberty allows. 
      <p> We know what works: Freedom works. We know what's right: Freedom is 
        right. We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on 
        Earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, and the exercise 
        of free will unhampered by the state. 
      <p> For the first time in this century, for the first time in perhaps all 
        history, man does not have to invent a system by which to live. We don't 
        have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better. 
        We don't have to wrest justice from the kings. We only have to summon 
        it from within ourselves. We must act on what we know. I take as my guide 
        the hope of a saint: In crucial things, unity; in important things, diversity; 
        in all things, generosity. 
      <p> America today is a proud, free nation, decent and civil, a place we 
        cannot help but love. We know in our hearts, not loudly and proudly but 
        as a simple fact, that this country has meaning beyond what we see, and 
        that our strength is a force for good. But have we changed as a nation 
        even in our time? Are we enthralled with material things, less appreciative 
        of the nobility of work and sacrifice? 
      <p> My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions. They are not the 
        measure of our lives. In our hearts we know what matters. We cannot hope 
        only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We must 
        hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend; a loving 
        parent; a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood, and town better 
        than he found it. And what do we want the men and women who work with 
        us to say when we're no longer there? That we were more driven to succeed 
        than anyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten 
        better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship? 
      <p> No President, no government can teach us to remember what is best in 
        what we are. But if the man you have chosen to lead this government can 
        help make a difference; if he can celebrate the quieter, deeper successes 
        that are made not of gold and silk but of better hearts and finer souls; 
        if he can do these things, then he must. 
      <p> America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral 
        principle. We as a people have such a purpose today. It is to make kinder 
        the face of the Nation and gentler the face of the world. My friends, 
        we have work to do. There are the homeless, lost and roaming. There are 
        the children who have nothing, no love and no normalcy. There are those 
        who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction -- drugs, 
        welfare, the demoralization that rules the slums. There is crime to be 
        conquered, the rough crime of the streets. There are young women to be 
        helped who are about to become mothers of children they can't care for 
        and might not love. They need our care, our guidance, and our education, 
        though we bless them for choosing life. 
      <p> The old solution, the old way, was to think that public money alone 
        could end these problems. But we have learned that that is not so. And 
        in any case, our funds are low. We have a deficit to bring down. We have 
        more will than wallet, but will is what we need. We will make the hard 
        choices, looking at what we have and perhaps allocating it differently, 
        making our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety. And then 
        we will do the wisest thing of all. We will turn to the only resource 
        we have that in times of need always grows: the goodness and the courage 
        of the American people. 
      <p> And I am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others, a new 
        activism, hands-on and involved, that gets the job done. We must bring 
        in the generations, harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the 
        unfocused energy of the young. For not only leadership is passed from 
        generation to generation but so is stewardship. And the generation born 
        after the Second World War has come of age. 
      <p> I have spoken of a Thousand Points of Light, of all the community organizations 
        that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good. We will 
        work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading, sometimes being led, 
        rewarding. We will work on this in the White House, in the Cabinet agencies. 
        I will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points 
        of light, and I'll ask every member of my government to become involved. 
        The old ideas are new again because they're not old, they are timeless: 
        duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression 
        in taking part and pitching in. 
      <p> We need a new engagement, too, between the Executive and the Congress. 
        The challenges before us will be thrashed out with the House and the Senate. 
        And we must bring the Federal budget into balance. And we must ensure 
        that America stands before the world united, strong, at peace, and fiscally 
        sound. But of course things may be difficult. We need to compromise; we've 
        had dissension. We need harmony; we've had a chorus of discordant voices. 
      <p> For Congress, too, has changed in our time. There has grown a certain 
        divisiveness. We have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in 
        which not each other's ideas are challenged but each other's motives. 
        And our great parties have too often been far apart and untrusting of 
        each other. It's been this way since Vietnam. That war cleaves us still. 
        But, friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago, and 
        surely the statute of limitation has been reached. This is a fact: The 
        final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to be 
        sundered by a memory. A new breeze is blowing, and the old bipartisanship 
        must be made new again. 
      <p> To my friends, and, yes, I do mean friends -- in the loyal opposition 
        and, yes, I mean loyal -- I put out my hand. I am putting out my hand 
        to you, Mr. Speaker. I am putting out my hand to you, Mr. Majority Leader. 
        For this is the thing: This is the age of the offered hand. And we can't 
        turn back clocks, and I don't want to. But when our fathers were young, 
        Mr. Speaker, our differences ended at the water's edge. And we don't wish 
        to turn back time, but when our mothers were young, Mr. Majority Leader, 
        the Congress and the Executive were capable of working together to produce 
        a budget on which this nation could live. Let us negotiate soon and hard. 
        But in the end, let us produce. The American people await action. They 
        didn't send us here to bicker. They ask us to rise above the merely partisan. 
        ``In crucial things, unity'' -- and this, my friends, is crucial. 
      <p> To the world, too, we offer new engagement and a renewed vow: We will 
        stay strong to protect the peace. The offered hand is a reluctant fist; 
        once made -- strong, and can be used with great effect. There are today 
        Americans who are held against their will in foreign lands and Americans 
        who are unaccounted for. Assistance can be shown here and will be long 
        remembered. Good will begets good will. Good faith can be a spiral that 
        endlessly moves on. 
      <p> Great nations like great men must keep their word. When America says 
        something, America means it, whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow 
        made on marble steps. We will always try to speak clearly, for candor 
        is a compliment; but subtlety, too, is good and has its place. While keeping 
        our alliances and friendships around the world strong, ever strong, we 
        will continue the new closeness with the Soviet Union, consistent both 
        with our security and with progress. One might say that our new relationship 
        in part reflects the triumph of hope and strength over experience. But 
        hope is good, and so is strength and vigilance. 
      <p> Here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the understandable 
        satisfaction of those who have taken part in democracy and seen their 
        hopes fulfilled. But my thoughts have been turning the past few days to 
        those who would be watching at home, to an older fellow who will throw 
        a salute by himself when the flag goes by and the woman who will tell 
        her sons the words of the battle hymns. I don't mean this to be sentimental. 
        I mean that on days like this we remember that we are all part of a continuum, 
        inescapably connected by the ties that bind. 
      <p> Our children are watching in schools throughout our great land. And 
        to them I say, Thank you for watching democracy's big day. For democracy 
        belongs to us all, and freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go higher 
        and higher with the breeze. And to all I say, No matter what your circumstances 
        or where you are, you are part of this day, you are part of the life of 
        our great nation. 
      <p> A President is neither prince nor pope, and I don't seek a window on 
        men's souls. In fact, I yearn for a greater tolerance, and easygoingness 
        about each other's attitudes and way of life. 
      <p> There are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united 
        and express our intolerance. The most obvious now is drugs. And when that 
        first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship, it may as well have been a deadly 
        bacteria, so much has it hurt the body, the soul of our country. And there 
        is much to be done and to be said, but take my word for it: This scourge 
        will stop! 
      <p> And so, there is much to do. And tomorrow the work begins. And I do 
        not mistrust the future. I do not fear what is ahead. For our problems 
        are large, but our heart is larger. Our challenges are great, but our 
        will is greater. And if our flaws are endless, God's love is truly boundless. 
      <p> Some see leadership as high drama and the sound of trumpets calling, 
        and sometimes it is that. But I see history as a book with many pages, 
        and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning. The 
        new breeze blows, a page turns, the story unfolds. And so, today a chapter 
        begins, a small and stately story of unity, diversity, and generosity 
        -- shared, and written, together. 
      <p> Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. 
      <p> Note: The President spoke at 12:05 p.m. at the West Front of the Capitol. 
        Prior to his address, the oath of office was administered by Chief Justice 
        William H. Rehnquist. The address was broadcast live on radio and television.
