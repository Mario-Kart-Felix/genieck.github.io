<p>16 Heshvan 5757 (October 30 , 1996)

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Statement of Opinion</font></b>

<p>In 5746 I was asked by Mr. Doron Witztum to prepare a list of the names
and
<br>appellations of 34 Torah sages. The list of sages was presented to
me by Mr.
<br>Witztum, and I was told that it was based on the Encyclopedia of Great
Men in
<br>Israel (Hebrew; ed. Dr. M. Margalioth). The criteria for inclusion
of a
<br>personality in the list was simply that his entry contains at least
three
<br>columns of text and that a date of birth or death be specified (day
and
<br>month). The list of names and appellations I prepared and forwarded
to Mr.
<br>Witztum was later published by him (together with Professor A. Rips
and Y.
<br>Rosenberg) in the article "Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book
of
<br>Genesis," in both the first version thereof (from early 5747), pp.
40-42, and
<br>the second version of the above-mentioned article (5748), pp. 16-17.
I shall
<br>hereinafter refer to this list as "the first list." A year later, Mr.
Witztum
<br>asked me to prepare a second list of names and appellations. This time,
the
<br>criteria for inclusion of a personality in the list was that his entry
<br>contains between one and a half and three columns of text and that
a date of
<br>birth or death be specified (day and month). I forwarded this additional
list
<br>of names and appellations to Mr. Witztum, and it was subsequently published
<br>in the second version of the above-mentioned article (5748) on pp.
25-26. I
<br>shall hereinafter refer to this list as "the second list." At that
time I
<br>confirmed that each of these lists of names and appellations "was based
on my
<br>own personal judgment and on the examinations I carried out with the
<br>assistance of the database in the Data Retrieval Institute at Bar Ilan
<br>University - the Responsa Project."

<p>At the time, I forwarded to Mr. Witztum only the results and conclusions
of
<br>my examinations. I have now been asked by him to clarify my rationale,
work
<br>method, examinations and conclusions with regard to the following questions:

<p>1. Does the Responsa database include additional names and appellations
<br>relating to the 32 sages in the second group that were not included
in the
<br>second list?
<br>2. If so, what are these names and appellations?
<br>3. And why were they not included in the list?

<p>The following is my answer to these questions, which I have extended
to
<br>include the principles I applied in my examination and in the conclusions
I
<br>forwarded to you at that time:

<p>Types of appellations: The great Torah sages were given affectionate
<br>appellations which are commonly used by those who study their writings,
or
<br>which appear in the writings of their pupils, their pupils' pupils,
and all
<br>those who discuss their writings. Some of the appellations, such as
"Rambam"
<br>and "the Vilna Gaon," are commonly known, while others are used mainly
within
<br>the confines of the Beit Midrash (a Torah academy).

<p>Database for determining the appellations: A researcher who wishes to
prepare
<br>a list of these names and appellations must be thoroughly familiar
with the
<br>different types of Torah literature, and with the customs used in quoting
and
<br>referring to the Jewish sages. For a certain portion of the Torah literature,
<br>we now have access to a new aid that may be of assistance in examining
the
<br>data, namely the computerized database of the Responsa project. This
database
<br>includes the names and appellations that appear in some 300 responsa
works,
<br>and constitutes an important aid in searching this type of rabbinical
<br>literature.

<p>Use of the Responsa database in the computer of the Data Retrieval Institute
<br>at Bar Ilan University: The Responsa database includes a considerable
<br>proportion of the responsa works (approximately 300), with cross-sections
<br>according to period and cultural region. The database also includes
the basic
<br>works of Jewish literature (the Bible and commentaries, Mishna, the
Talmuds,
<br>the Aggadic Midrashim, and so on). This database is an important aid
in
<br>searches relating to the literature of the Poskim (legalists). However,
the
<br>existing program does not enable a researcher to ask what are the names
and
<br>appellations of a given sage. Consequently the researcher must determine
in
<br>advance the appellations for which he wishes to search, and to use
the
<br>database to clarify the distribution of particular appellations and
their
<br>orthography. Personal judgment must be employed in evaluating the information
<br>in the pool per se, and in evaluating it relative to the information
in the
<br>large number of important Halakhic (legal) works not included in the
<br>database, as well as customary practices in the broader literature.

<p>It may certainly be anticipated that sages whose works do not relate
<br>primarily to the field of Halakhic rulings will not appear in the database.
<br>Accordingly,&nbsp; sages who were Biblical commentators, grammatical
scholars
<br>(Medakdekim), poets, Hassidic Zaddikim, Kabbalists (Mekubalim) or
<br>philosophers will not appear in the Responsa database, or at best will
appear
<br>a small number of times. Accordingly, this source does not provide
a reliable
<br>picture of the different appellations, and the distribution of names
and
<br>appellations does not reflect their actual place, importance and value.
The
<br>Responsa database did not help us in establishing the appellations
of sages
<br>no. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, 17, 27, 30 and 31 (in the second list).

<p>Professional judgment: In addition to his expertise, the researcher
must also
<br>exercise professional discretion in a number of areas, as follows:

<p>(a) As is well known, Torah literature is rich in abbreviations and
acronyms,
<br>which relate both to the Halakhic concepts under discussion and to
the
<br>various sages. A distinction must be made between a simple abbreviation
or
<br>acronym used only at one place or in a particular text, and an abbreviation
<br>or acronym that constitutes an appellation. The yardstick for determining
<br>this point is quite simple: if the abbreviation or acronym has become
an
<br>appellation, it has a specific pronunciation. Accordingly, a distinction
<br>should be made between abbreviations and acronyms which are pronounced
as
<br>words, such as:&nbsp; <font>ם"במר</font>
(Rambam), <font>ל"שרהמ</font>
(Maharshal), <font>ל"רהמ</font>
(Maharal), and
<br>those which are not pronounced as words and are merely an abbreviated
written
<br>form, such as <font>ר"רהמ</font>
(Morenu HaRav Rabbi), <font>ר"רהומ</font>
(Morenu Verabenu HaRav
<br>Rabbi), <font>י"ב</font>
(Beit Yosef), <font>ט"יות</font>
(TOsefot Yom Tov), and <font>י"בונ</font>
(NOda BeYehuda).

<p>When I was asked to prepare the list of the names and appellations of
the
<br>great Torah sages (the first list), I did not include abbreviations
or
<br>acronyms that are not pronounced as a word, since these are not appellations.
<br>The list includes acronyms that are pronounced as a word, such as Rambam
<br>(Rabenu Moshe Ben Maimon), Maharshal (Morenu HaRav Rabbi Shlomo Lurie),
and
<br>Maharal (Morenu HaRav Rabbi Liva). The list does not included acronyms
not
<br>pronounced as a word, such as: <font>י"ב</font>,
<font>ט"יות</font>,
<font>י"בונ</font>,
<font>ר"רהמ</font>,
etc. Naturally I
<br>acted in the same manner when preparing the second list.

<p>&nbsp;(Two)&nbsp; A researcher concerned with the biography of a single
person will
<br>also mention the appellations relating to the subject of his work.
However, a
<br>researcher preparing a list of names and appellations of individuals
and
<br>Torah sages must take account of the fact that some appellations were
used
<br>over the generations to refer to several different individuals. A well-known
<br>example of this is the appellation "Maharsha" ("<font>א"שרהמ</font>")
referring to Rabbi
<br>Shemuel Eliezer Edels. This appellation is also found on occasions
with
<br>reference to other sages, such as: Rabbi Shemuel Aboab, Rabbi Shlomoh
<br>Amarilio, Rabbi Shemuel Eliezer Alfandari and others. In an historical
list
<br>of the appellations of Torah sages, Rabbi Shemuel Eliezer Edels will
receive
<br>the appellation Maharsha, since he is the most famous of the sages
referred
<br>to by this appellation, since his work is the most famous among all
Talmud
<br>students in all the Diaspora communities, and since he is known by
this
<br>appellation by them.

<p>Another example is when one of the people bearing an appellation is
from the
<br>Rishonim (early sages), while the other is from the Acharonim (later
<br>sages).Since in the world of Torah literature the Rishonim enjoy a
special
<br>status vis-a-vis the Acharonim, the appellation will be identified
with the
<br>Rishon rather than with the Acharon. Thus in the first list I did not
mention
<br>the appellation&nbsp;&nbsp; <font>ש"בירה</font>
(Harivash) as referring to Rabbi Yisrael Ba'al Shem
<br>Tov (the Besht), since this appellation is identified with Rabbi Yitzhak
<br>Bar-Sheshet, one of the Rishonim sages.

<p>Sometimes several sages of equal status are referred to by the same
<br>appellation. Accordingly, those mentioning these sages must clarify
to whom
<br>they are referring, by mentioning their books or their full name. In
such
<br>cases I am unsure whether or not to take the position that this appellation
<br>is not unequivocally related to a certain sage, and that it constitutes
a
<br>simple abbreviation not to be included in the list. In practice, I
acted as
<br>follows: If, in the above-mentioned encyclopedia, the appellation is
included
<br>in the entry for that sage, I also included it in the list; if not,
I did not
<br>include it.
<br>Sometimes the common appellation of a number of sages is not an abbreviation,
<br>but a word or expression. For example, a number of sages were known
as
<br>"Ashkenazi" (European). On its own, this appellation does not identify
the
<br>sage. This appellation was used in the case of Ashkenazi sages who
lived in
<br>Sephardi (Oriental) communities where the appellation was customarily
added
<br>to their name. For example, Hakham Zvi (in the first list) was known
as Zvi
<br>Ashkenazi, but the appellation "Ashkenazi" did not become his family
name and
<br>his son was not called by this name. At most, the term "Ashkenazi"
may be
<br>included as part of the full name. The same principle applies to the
<br>appellation "Mizrachi" as used for a Sephardi sage who lives in an
Ashkenazi
<br>community. It is true that, over the years, these appellations became
<br>accepted family names (which is why we find Sephardi families with
the family
<br>name Ashkenazi).

<p>(c) Many sages are named after the titles of their books. Here, too,
the
<br>researcher who encounters such references must discern whether the
reference
<br>is to the sage or to his book. For example, one may encounter the expression
<br>&nbsp;<font>&nbsp;
הנשמ</font> <font>ףסכ
ברה בתכ </font>("The Rabbi Kesef
Mishneh wrote..") This could refer to
<br>Rabbi Yosef Caro, in which case the appellation would be understood
as <font>הנשמ
ףסכ ב"רה</font>
<br><font>&nbsp;=הנשמ
ףסכ לעב ברה</font>
(HaRav Kesef Mishneh, i.e. HaRav Ba'al Kesef
<br>Mishneh--"the Rabbi who wrote "Kesef Mishneh"). It could, however,
refer to a
<br>quotation from Rabbi Caro's book Kesef Mishneh, in which case the reference
<br>would be understood as <font>הנשמ
ףסכב בתכ </font>("he wrote
in Kesef Mishneh"). In
<br>general, it may be said that the sages were known by their main and
most
<br>famous book. For example, Rabbi Azariah Figo (in the second list) wrote
a
<br>well-known book entitled Giddulei Terumah, and another book which also
became
<br>quite well known (though less important) entitled Bina Le-Ittim. Let
us now
<br>see how he is referred to by the author of Sha'arei Teshuvah (a collection
of
<br>excerpts from responsa works on the Orah Haim section of Shulhan Arukh),
<br>Section 223: "And Ba'al Giddulei Terumah...wrote in his work Bina
<br>Le-Ittim..." A similar example is found regarding Rabbi Haim Benbenest
(in
<br>the second list). While his most important work is Keneset ha-Gedolah,
he
<br>also wrote other works. He is mentioned in the responsa work Yehaveh
Da'at
<br>(Part 5, ref. 54) as follows+: "... Ba'al Keneset ha-Gedolah in his
responsa
<br>Ba'ei Hayei..." and, op. cit. (Part 6, ref. 49): "... Ba'al Keneset
ha-Gedola
<br>in his work Dina de-Hayei..."

<p>Some sages composed a number of works but for various reasons are not
known
<br>by these titles. This may be because they became known by another name
or
<br>appellation, or because their compositions were not particularly famous
or
<br>widely disseminated.

<p>(d) When a sage has two Hebrew first names, such as Moshe Haim (Luzzato,
in
<br>the first list), we have the appellation "Rabbi Moshe Haim". When the
second
<br>name is influenced by a foreign language, such as Yehoshua Hoeschel
(in the
<br>first list), the customary form in writing is Yehoshua Hamekhuneh Hoeschel
<br>("Yehoshua who is known as Hoeschel"), in other words "Hoeschel" is
perceived
<br>as an appellation. Accordingly, I distinguished between these names.
I
<br>consider his name to be Rabbi Yehoshua, while his appellation is Rabbi
<br>Hoeschel. (provided this appellation was well-known and unambiguous,
as
<br>discussed above in section b).

<p>(e) Use of the definite article (<font>
העידיה א"ה</font>). Many
appellations in the Torah
<br>literature are referred to with the definite article (in fact, the
use of the
<br>definite article sometimes proves that the expressions constitutes
an
<br>appellation). Thus, for example, we often find the expressions <font>ל"שרהמה</font>
<br>(HaMaharshal),&nbsp; <font>א"שרהמה</font>&nbsp;
(HaMaharsha, both in the first list), and so on. In
<br>general, I included the appellation both with the definite article
and
<br>without. However, there are exceptions. For example, Rashi (in the
first
<br>list) is not known as <font>י"שרה</font>
(with the definite article). The opposite also
<br>applies - some appellations never appear without the definite article,
such
<br>as <font>א"רגה</font>
(HaGra; in the first list). Appellations composed of two or more
<br>words do not take the definite article; thus one does not write&nbsp;<font>
ףסוי</font> <font>תיבה</font>
<br>(HaBeit Yosef) or&nbsp;<font>
ורא&divide; י"רהמה</font>
(HaMahari Caro), since this does not conform to
<br>the rules of Hebrew grammar (though various sources may include examples
of
<br>irregular expressions of this kind, which do not conform to the rules
of
<br>Hebrew grammar).

<p>(f) Sometimes appellations appear with minor variations, such as <font>ל"שרהמ</font>
<br>(Maharshal) or <font>ל"שרהומ</font>
(Moharshal), <font>א"שרהמ</font>
(Maharsha) or <font>א"שרהומ</font>&nbsp;
(Moharsha)
<br>(according to the authors' style, period and location). A similar problem
<br>occurs for the same reasons with such variant forms as <font>ל"שרה</font>
(Harashal) and
<br><font>ל"שרהמ</font>&nbsp;
(Maharshal),&nbsp;<font>
ורא&divide;</font> <font>י"רה
</font>(HaRi Caro) and <font>ורא&divide;
י"רהמ&nbsp;</font> (Mahari Caro). I
<br>proceeded as follows: (1) If one variant is much more common in the
database,
<br>I adopted that form. (2) If the variations appear with similar frequency,
I
<br>exercised my own professional judgment (based on my knowledge of other
<br>sources).

<p>(g)&nbsp; It should be noted that new material is added to the Responsa
project
<br>database from time to time, both from the basic literature and from
responsa
<br>works. Accordingly, appellations from new works may have been added
since the
<br>time I composed the two lists.

<p>In reply to your questions: Based on the preceding remarks, my reply
is as
<br>follows:
<br>(1) There are additional appellations found in the Responsa database
<br>referring to the above-mentioned sages but not included in the second
list.
<br>(2-3) Details of the additional appellations not included, and the
reason
<br>they were not included (the following numbers relate to the above-mentioned
<br>second list):

<p>1.&nbsp;<font> ד"בא
א"רה </font>(HaRa Abad) - not pronounced (sounds like&nbsp;<font>
ד"בא</font> <font>ערה</font>
<br>which means "the evil Abad"). <font>ד"בא</font>
<font>י"באר</font>,&nbsp;<font>
ד"בא י"בארה</font>
(Ra'avi Abad, HaRa'avi
<br>Abad) - not included. I do not remember now why not. For the appellation
<br><font>ד"בא</font>
<font>ברה
</font>(HaRav Abad), I did not use the form without the definite article
<br><font>ד"בא</font>&nbsp;
<font>בר
</font>(Rav Abad).

<p>2&nbsp;<font> י&divide;חצי</font>&nbsp;
<font>א"רהמ</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp; (Mahara Yitzhaki) -&nbsp;&nbsp; this seems to be a simple
<br>abbreviation, not an appellation.

<p>6.&nbsp;<font> יזנכשא</font>
<font>א"רה
</font>(HaRa Ashkenazi),&nbsp;<font>
יזנכשא</font> <font>א"רהמ
</font>(Mahara Ashkenazi) -
<br>simple abbreviations, and Ashkenazi is a general appellation (see above,
<br>"Professional Judgment," section b).
<br><font>&nbsp;'ה
ישעמ,&nbsp; 'ד</font> <font>ישעמ</font>-
simple abbreviations, which are accepted references
<br>for the name&nbsp;<font>
םשה ישעמ</font> (Ma'asei
HaShem) or&nbsp;<font>
ה\ו\ה\י</font> <font>ישעמ</font>
(Ma'asei
<br>YH-WH).

<p>7. <font>א"דרהמ</font>
(Maharda). Appears only in the responsa Seridei Esh, and only
<br>&nbsp;
<br>when introduced previously as "<font>םיהנפוא
ד"רהמ 'גה</font>" (Hag[aon] Maharad
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Oppenheim), and subsequently as<font>
א"דרהמ</font>&nbsp; <font>'גה</font>
(Hag' Maharda), thus
<br>proving that this is a simple abbreviation. By the way, with hindsight
I
<br>would be inclined to reject the appellation "<font>
םיהנפוא ד"רהמ</font>"&nbsp;
(Maharad
<br>Oppenheim). <font>א"דרה</font>
(HaRada), too, was included because it appears in the
<br>above-mentioned encyclopedia.

<p>8. As I explained above in the section "Using the Responsa Database,"
this
<br>&nbsp;is one of the sages whose appellations are not likely to appear
in the
<br>responsa database. I did, however, wish to mention that he is referred
to as
<br>"author of the composition Kuzari Sheni (=The Second Kuzari)" (responsa
Hatam
<br>Sofer and responsa Melamed le-Ho'il), rather than by reference to the
other
<br>name of his book, Mateh Dan. (The name Kuzari Sheni became popular
because it
<br>was named after an earlier famous work, The Kuzari, by a different
author).

<p>&nbsp;10.&nbsp;<font>
א"חרהמ</font> (Maharha) - this abbreviation
is shared by several sages: Rabbi
<br>Haim Abulafia the First, Second and Third; Rabbi Haim Alfandari, etc.
Some
<br>(cf. the Encyclopedia Hebraica) prefer to use this appellation for
Rabbi Haim
<br>Abulafia the first, rather than the sage referred to here. In the responsa
<br>Mor ve-Ohalot, the author is obliged to refer to him as "Maharha the
Latter";
<br>others who mention him are obliged to identify him in some manner (by
the
<br>titles of his compositions, etc.).<font>
א"חרהומ</font> (Moharha)- rejected
for the
<br>above-mentioned reasons (this form is also much less common).
<br><font>היפעלובא,&nbsp;
איפעלובא</font> (Abulafia)
- this form of the family name is imprecise,
<br>since the Arabic form of the name is "Father of Health" (Abu el-Afia),
which
<br>is how it should appear.

<p>&nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<font>
ב"יבח</font> <font>ברה
</font>(HaRav Haviv), or in a more abbreviated form <font>ב"יבחה</font>
<br>(HaHaviv), or in a variant addition,&nbsp;&nbsp;<font>
ם"דא</font> <font>ב"יבח
</font>(Haviv Adam). These
<br>appellations are based on the acronym for <font>תשנבנב</font>
<font>לארשי</font>
<font>'רב
םייח </font>(=<font>ב"יבח</font>
<br>Haviv; Haim Bar Yisrael Benvenisti). This appellation overlooked while
I was
<br>preparing the list.
<br><font>&nbsp;ב"חרהמ</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Maharhab) - likewise. If it is to be included in the list, <font>ב"חרהומ</font>
<br>&nbsp; (Moharhab) should be rejected according to section f(2) in the
section
<br>"Professional Judgment."

<p>13.<font> ש"חרהומ</font>
(Moharhash) - rejected because<font>
ש"חרהמ</font>&nbsp; (Maharhash) is much
more
<br>common, according to section f(1) above.&nbsp;<font>
יתבש ח"רהמ</font>
(Maharah Shabbetai) - a
<br>simple abbreviation.

<p>18.&nbsp;<font> לישעה</font>
<font>יבר
</font>(Rabbi Hoeschel) -<font>
א&divide;אר&divide;מ</font> <font>לישעה
יבר </font>(Rabbi Hoeschel of Cracow;
<br>no. 14 in the first list) is much better known by this appellation.
<br>&nbsp;<font> עשוי
יבר</font> (Rabbi Yosha) - an appellation shared by
several sages; for
<br>example, Ba'al HaSema (no. 15 in the first list) is better known by
this
<br>appellation. Moreover, I do not see this appellation as unambiguous
even in
<br>the case of Ba'al HaSema.

<p>19.&nbsp;<font> ינארטמ</font>
<font>י"רה
</font>(HaRi Mitrani) - usually refers to the well-known Rishonim
<br>&nbsp;<font>ד"ירה</font>
(HaRid) and <font>ז"אירה</font>
(HaRiaz).
<br><font>&nbsp;ינארט</font>&nbsp;
<font>י"רהמ</font>
(Mahari Trani),&nbsp;<font>
ינארטמ</font> <font>י"רהמ</font>
(Mahari Mitrani) - I do not
<br>recall why these were rejected.<font>&nbsp;
ינארט</font> <font>י"רהומ</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Mohari Trani),
<br><font>ינארטמ</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font>י"רהומ
</font>(Mohari Mitrani) - less widespread than the above-mentioned
<br>appellations.

<p>&nbsp;21.&nbsp;<font>
ב"ירהמ</font> (Mahariv) - attributed to
various sages, including Rabbi Yisrael
<br>Bassan and Rabbi Yisrael Binyamin, but most associated with the best-known
<br>among these sages -&nbsp;<font>
אנורב</font> <font>י"רהמ
</font>(Mahari Bruna).<font>
ב"ירהומ</font> (Mohariv) - likewise.

<p><font>&nbsp;</font>
(<font>בר
יב</font>) <font>בריב</font>
<font>י"רה</font>
(Hari Beirav (Bei Rav)) - much less common than&nbsp;<font>
</font>(<font>בר
יב</font>) <font>בריב
י"רהמ</font>
<br>&nbsp;(Mahari Beirav (Bei Rav)).&nbsp;<font>&nbsp;</font>
(<font>בר
יב</font>) <font>בריב
י"רהומ</font>(Mohari Beirav (Bei
<br>Rav)) - much less common than Mahari Beirav (Bei Rav).
<br><font>ר"בירהמ</font>
(Maharibar),&nbsp;<font>
ר"בירהומ</font> (Moharibar)
- minor variants on <font>ר"בירה</font>
<br>(Haribar), rejected according to section f(2) above.

<p>22. <font>זיגח</font>
(Hagiz) - rejected because it is clear from his son's introduction
<br>to his father's book Halakhot Ketanot, that the correct spelling is
with an
<br>Aleph (<font>זיגאח</font>).
<font>זיגאח
י"רהמ</font> (Mahari Hagiz) - I do not remember
why this was
<br>omitted. <font>ח"ירהמ</font>
(Maharih) - identified with a Rishon sage quoted frequently
<br>in Hagahot Asheri (Rabbi Yehezekiah of Magdeburg).

<p>23.&nbsp;<font> ל"גס</font>
<font>י"רה
</font>(HaRi Segal) - much less common that&nbsp;<font>
ל"גס</font> <font>י"רהמ
</font>(Mahari Segal).
<br><font>&nbsp;יולה</font>
<font>י"רה
</font>(Hari Halevi) - this usually refers to a Rishon sage,<font>
שאגמ</font> <font>ןבא
י"רה</font>
<br>(HaRi Ibn-Migash).&nbsp;<font>
ןילומ י"רה</font> (HaRi
Molin) - much less common than
<br><font>ןילומ</font>&nbsp;
<font>י"רהמ
</font>(Mahari Molin).<font>
ל"ירהומ</font> (Moharil) - much less
common than <font>ל"ירהמ</font>
<br>&nbsp;(Maharil).

<p>24. A number of variants have developed from the basic form of <font>ץ"בעי</font>
<br>(Yaabez): <font>ץ"בעיר</font>
(Riyaabez), <font>ץ"בעירה</font>
(HaRiyaabez), <font>ץ"בעירהמ&nbsp;</font>
(Mahariyaabez). I
<br>chose <font>ץ"בעירה</font>&nbsp;
(HaRiyaabez) but rejected <font>ץ"בעיר</font>
(Riyaabez), because I saw it
<br>as a simple abbreviation; this latter form occurs almost exclusively
in
<br>Iggerot Mosheh. <font>ץ"בעירהמ</font>
(Mahariyaabez) - appears as often as&nbsp; <font>ץ"בעירה</font>
<br>(HaRiyaabez), but rejected according to section f(2) above. Another
form
<br><font>&nbsp;ץ"בעי</font>
<font>י"רהמ</font>
(Mahari Yaabez) exists (it appears in the Hatam Sofer); this
<br>appellation also reflects the name Yisrael, which was associated with
this
<br>sage. I overlooked this form.

<p>27. As is clear from the list, the forms&nbsp;<font>
אתוכז ם"רהמ</font>
(Maharam Zacuta) and
<br><font>&nbsp; ותוכז</font>
<font>ם"רהמ
</font>(Maharam Zacuto) were overlooked. See the comment above in the
<br>section "Use of the Responsa Database," to the effect that this database
<br>cannot be used to determine the accepted appellation for<font>
תוכז</font> <font>השמ
יבר </font>(Rabbi
<br>Moshe Zacut).

<p>30. The database includes the abbreviations&nbsp;<font>
י&divide;יר ח"ערהומ</font>
(Moharah Ricchi) but
<br>this was rejected, because it is not pronounced.&nbsp;<font>
י&divide;יר ע"רה</font> (HaRa Ricchi)
-
<br>rejected because it is not pronounced. See the comment above in the
section
<br>"Use of the Responsa Database," to the effect that this database cannot
be
<br>used to determine the accepted appellation for the Kabbalist&nbsp;<font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
<br><font>י&divide;יר</font>
<font>יח
לאונמע יבר </font>(Rabbi
Immanuel Hai Ricchi).

<p>31.&nbsp;<font> יבערש
ש"רהמ</font> (Maharash Shar'abi),&nbsp;<font>
יבערש</font> <font>ש"רהומ</font>
(Moharash Shar'abi) -
<br>simple abbreviations. See the comment above in the section "Use of
the
<br>Responsa Database," to the effect that this database cannot be used
to
<br>determine the accepted appellation for the Kabbalist <font>יבערש</font>
<font>םולש
יבר </font>(Rabbi
<br>Shalom Shar'abi).

<p>General comment: All the appellations of sages based on the names of
their
<br>books are exactly as they appear in the list. If there are other appellations
<br>of this form that appear in the database but are not included in the
list of
<br>appellations, they were rejected according&nbsp; to "Personal Judgment,"
section
<br>C.
