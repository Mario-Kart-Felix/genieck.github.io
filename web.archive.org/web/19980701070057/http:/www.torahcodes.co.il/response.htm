<p>-----------------------------------------
<br>Jerusalem,&nbsp; Nov. 27, '96

<p>At the request of [Professor] Robert Aumann, we are submitting in writing
a
<br>number of questions which came up as we read your paper [Statistical
Science,
<br>Vol. 9, No. 3. '94] and the reports concerning the discovery of a
<br>letter-skipping code in the Torah, and during the course of our attempts
to
<br>replicate the experiments described therein. We would be grateful if
we could
<br>receive your responses in writing as well.

<p>1. We would like to receive details on the chronology of the research:
For
<br>example, who first discovered the great proximity between the name-date
<br>pairs, and when? When was the first list prepared? The second list?
Who
<br>requested the preparation of a second list? When were the results first
<br>submitted to a scientific journal, and which one? How did it occur
to you to
<br>reexamine the dates reported by Margalioth? Did you investigate all
of the
<br>dates, or only those which seemed to you, for whatever reason, suspicious?
Or
<br>only those instances in which you knew somehow about the existence
of an
<br>alternative? Etc.

<p>2. We would appreciate it if we could receive from you a data base containing
<br>the text of the book of Exodus and the other books of the Pentateuch,
so that
<br>we may conduct our own investigations, assured that you and we are
using the
<br>exact same text. We would be grateful if you could provide us with
a copy of
<br>your own data base. We would also like to know what the level of significance
<br>of the first list comes to according to your calculations, so that
we may
<br>compare it with our own, in order to verify that there is no flaw in
the
<br>program.

<p>3. Margalioth's encyclopedia, which you used, was published in '61.
Is there
<br>a more recent source concerning outstanding Rabbinic personalities?
Is there,
<br>perhaps a computerized data base to be found somewhere? Or at least,
a source
<br>&nbsp;from which it would be possible to draw, for example, a list
of birth and
<br>death dates for outstanding rabbinic personalities, not limited to
those
<br>appearing on your list? How can people like ourselves receive a list
which is
<br>more up-to-date and accurate than that of Margalioth?

<p>4. Why did you use in your list of dates only 3 out of the 4 forms (<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">
&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;</font> <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&agrave;</font>,
<br><font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;&aacute;
&agrave;</font>, and&nbsp; <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;
&agrave;&aacute;</font>, but not <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;&aacute;
&agrave;&aacute;</font>)? And in general, why did you not use
<br>all the other possible forms (for example: <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&iuml;&aring;&ugrave;&ccedil;&oslash;&icirc;</font>
in addition to <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&iuml;&aring;&ugrave;&ccedil;</font>,
<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&oslash;&eacute;&eacute;&agrave;</font>
<br>in addition to <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&oslash;&eacute;&agrave;</font>,
<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&aring;&eacute;&igrave;&ntilde;&euml;</font>
in addition to <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&aring;&igrave;&ntilde;&euml;</font>,&nbsp;<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">
&oslash;&atilde;&agrave; &ccedil;"&oslash;</font> in addition to <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&oslash;&atilde;&agrave;
&agrave;</font>,
<br><font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&auml;&eth;&ugrave;&auml;
&ugrave;&agrave;&oslash;</font> in addition to&nbsp; <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;</font>
<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&agrave;</font>,&nbsp;<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">
&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;&igrave; &agrave;&eacute;</font>, etc.)?

<p>5. We attempted to compile for ourselves a list of famous rabbinic figures
<br>from the Encyclopedia, using the criteria you specified. There were
several
<br>discrepancies which we would like to ask you about:

<p>- For Rabbi Aharon of Karlin there was only a single column plus 11
lines of
<br>bibliographical text, and not the required 17 lines. Why was he included?

<p>- The Vilna Gaon died on the third day of Chol Hamoed Sukkot (the
<br>intermediate days of the festival of Sukkot). Is this not the 18th
of Tishri
<br>(whereas in your list it says: 19th of Tishri)?

<p>- For Rabbi David Ganz there are 2 columns and 31 lines of text, according
to
<br>which he should have been included in the second list. Why was he included
in
<br>the first list?

<p>- For Rabbi Yehudah Ayash there is&nbsp; only a single column plus 15
lines of
<br>text. Why was he included?

<p>- For Rabbi Yehosef Ha-Nagid there is only a single column plus 16 lines
of
<br>text. Why was he included? Besides the fact that his dates do not meet
the
<br>criteria.

<p>- The date of birth of Israel Baal Shem Tov is not mentioned in Margalioth.
<br>Can you direct us to your source?

<p>- Why was Rabbi Meir Eisenstat not included in the second list? There
are
<br>exactly 1.5 columns of text for him, that is, a column plus 17 lines.

<p>These are our questions for the moment. Thank you.

<p>BS"D
<br>15 Tevet 5757
<br>( Dec. 25, '96)
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Dear Professor Aumann,

<p>&nbsp;Greetings. I am writing in response to a letter dated Nov.27,
'96, signed by
<br>Professor Maya Bar-Hillel and Dr. Dror Bar-Natan. (The paragraph numbers
<br>below correspond to the question numbers in the aforementioned letter):

<p>1. We were asked about the chronology of our research. Here is a summary
of
<br>how things developed:

<p>A. In the spring of '85 we discovered two phenomena relating to ELS's
<br>(Equidistant Letter Sequences):

<p>(i)&nbsp; A tendency towards convergence between ELS's which are minimal
over
<br>large segments of the book of Genesis, and which have a conceptual
<br>relationship between them, as they appear on two-dimensional tables
dictated
<br>by the ELS's themselves (as explained in the paper).

<p>(ii)&nbsp; A tendency towards convergence between ELS's as above and
expressions
<br>appearing in the text on two-dimensional tables, as above (as explained
in
<br>the second paper).

<p>B. In a meeting which took place in May '85, Eliyahu Rips suggested
that we
<br>move from using intuitive impressions to quantitative measurement.
To this
<br>end we defined the function which is designated in our paper as c(w,
w'). A
<br>computer program for calculating this quantitative value was prepared
over
<br>the course of that summer by Yoav Rosenberg, and it was tested by measuring
<br>convergences from the already existing pool of examples.

<p>C. In the autumn of '85 Eliyahu suggested that we check ourselves by
<br>examining an a priori list of word pairs. He proposed using pairs of
the kind
<br>-- "personality-date (of birth or death)" -- because the conceptual
<br>relationship between them is particularly well defined. He proposed
using
<br>outstanding rabbinic personalities because if the phenomenon under
<br>investigation was genuine, it seemed reasonable to assume that outstanding
<br>rabbinic personalities would receive fuller treatment in the "hidden
text"
<br>than others might. Until that point, neither phenomena (i) nor (ii)
had been
<br>investigated in relationship to this topic, therefore we had no prior
<br>knowledge whether any tendency towards "personality-date" convergences
<br>existed. On the other hand, one example of this type of relationship
had
<br>emerged from Doron's previous work, which was an elaboration of a concept
of
<br>Rabbi Weissmandl, o.b.m., concerning ELS's with skip lengths of special
<br>significance. (In this example the name "Herzl" was paired with his
birth
<br>date, the 10th of Iyar).

<p>D. Eliyahu presented his proposal to investigate name-date convergences
for a
<br>list of outstanding rabbinic personalities before at least two scientists:
<br>Professor Zevin from the Department of Physics, and Professor Shenkovsky
from
<br>the Department of Mathematics. He even explained to them the function
we had
<br>defined. Professor Shenkovsky's reaction was (with a certain degree
of
<br>humor): "I don't know whether I should wish you luck . . . "

<p>E. It was Doron's task to see to the preparation of the list and to
carry out
<br>the measurements. Since he had no prior experience in the requisite
areas of
<br>bibliography and linguistics, he turned for assistance to the linguist
Yaakov
<br>Orbach, o.b.m.&nbsp; (who passed away last year), who directed him
to the
<br>Encyclopedia of Great Men in Israel, by Dr. Mordechai Margalioth. From
this
<br>source Doron selected the "greatest" personalities using the following
<br>criteria: His list was comprised of those whose entry consisted of
at least
<br>three columns of text, and for whom a date of birth and/or death was
cited.
<br>These were the 34 personalities, whose names and appellations were
to comprise
<br>the list (now known as the first list).

<p>It is well known that encyclopedias contain errors, therefore Doron
gave the
<br>list to two people, who were to compare the dates appearing in the
<br>encyclopedia with those appearing in several other sources. They were
to make
<br>note of any additional information pertaining to the dates. A few weeks
later
<br>Doron received the reports of the two crosscheckers and learned that
they had
<br>found the following:

<p>(i) There is a well known dispute concerning the dates of death of two
<br>personalities: Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi and the Baal Shem Tov.

<p>(ii) There was an error concerning one of the dates in the encyclopedia
--
<br>that of Rabbi David Ganz.

<p>(iii). One date omitted from the encyclopedia is known -- the birth
date of
<br>the Baal Shem Tov.
<br>One of the crosscheckers mentioned to Doron that in his perusal of
the
<br>sources he learned of additional names or appellations for some of
the
<br>personalities.
<br>F. With all of this information in hand, Doron returned to Yaakov Orbach,
and
<br>asked his advice concerning the dates, and concerning the names and
<br>appellations. Regarding the proper indication of the Hebrew dates and
the
<br>correct spelling of the names and appellations, Mr. Orbach proffered
his own
<br>linguistic expertise. The principles which guided him appear in the
paper.
<br>Concerning the question of which names or appellations to use for each
of the
<br>Sages, he recommended turning to Professor Shlomo Zalman Havlin, who
is well
<br>known for his bibliographic expertise. Doron approached Professor Havlin
and
<br>gave him the list of the 34 personalities, and requested that he prepare
a
<br>list of names and appellations which, in his opinion, characterize
these
<br>Sages.

<p>G. Professor Havlin prepared the list of names in the winter of '85-86.
Then
<br>an experiment was run on the first list. When this experiment proved
<br>successful, we decided to write a paper. This paper was published as
a
<br>preprint on Oct. 6, '86 (the "White Preprint").

<p>H. This paper was sent to Professor D. Kazhdan, who passed it on to
Professor
<br>P. Diaconis. In a letter of response to Professor Kazhdan, dated Dec.30,
'86,
<br>which was later forwarded to us, Professor Diaconis suggested that
we prepare
<br>a second list of famous personalities, and that we investigate it using
the
<br>exact same procedure.

<p>I. Doron prepared a new list of Sages using the same encyclopedia. This
time
<br>it included those personalities whose entries consisted of between
1.5 and 3
<br>columns. He found 32 such personalities. Since experience had shown
that on
<br>the first list there were dates which were in doubt, or simply wrong,
Doron
<br>was concerned that with the Sages on the new list, who were less famous,
<br>there were liable to be more errors. He therefore decided to double
check all
<br>of the dates, using the resources of the National Library. And indeed,
<br>several errors and doubtful dates were detected, of which he made note
in the
<br>second preprint. He passed on this second list to Professor Havlin,
in order
<br>that he should prepare a second list of names and appellations.

<p>J. Once we had all the data in hand, we carried out the experiment on
the
<br>second list. We then performed an additional test in which we paired
all the
<br>names on the second list with the dates of the next personality on
the list.
<br>This test, too, was performed at the request of Professor Diaconis.
These
<br>measurements were completed by May '87, and were sent on May 19 to
Professor
<br>Diaconis. In the wake of these experiments a new version of the paper
was
<br>composed. It was then published as the second preprint (the "Blue Preprint")
<br>in the winter of '87-'88.

<p>K. We wanted to submit the paper for publication in the PNAS [Proceedings
of
<br>the Nationakl Academy of Sciences], and since submission of a paper
for
<br>publication in this forum must be done by a member of the National
Academy of
<br>the Sciences, we turned to Professor Robert J. Aumann. We quickly discovered
<br>that this periodical puts a limit on the length of the papers it publishes.
<br>In order to comply with the regulations of the journal we were forced
to omit
<br>some of the information included in the paper (including the tables
of names
<br>and appellations). We prepared an abridged version of the paper. This
<br>preprint is appended to our letter.

<p>L. Negotiations were carried out over whether or not to publish this
preprint
<br>as a paper. It was during the course of these negotiations that Professor
<br>Diaconis first proposed, in a letter dated Aug. 3,'88, that we perform
a test
<br>based on a large number of random permutations. Eventually the details
of the
<br>test, the number of permutations and the required level of significance
were
<br>specified by Professor Diaconis in a letter dated Sept.5, '90. He had
already
<br>proposed using Knuth's Algorithm P as the mechanism for producing the
<br>permutations. All of the details of his proposal are described in the
<br>published paper. He requested that this test be carried out on the
second
<br>list.

<p>M. At Professor Aumann's suggestion, the paper was rewritten before
this test
<br>was performed, with the exception of the results of the test which
was yet to
<br>be carried out.
<br>&nbsp;[Because English is not our native language, this version of
the paper was
<br>rewritten by an English-speaking scientist. When we reviewed the manuscript,
<br>we overlooked the fact that the description of Professor Havlin's method
of
<br>compiling the list may be misinterpreted. As he confirmed in writing
at the
<br>time that he submitted his list,&nbsp; "[the list] was based on my
own personal
<br>judgment and on the examinations I carried out with the assistance
of the
<br>database in the Data Retrieval Institute at Bar Ilan University - the
<br>Responsa Project"] .
<br>In this form the paper was sent out to additional scholars for critique.
Once
<br>they had approved the test and specified the required level of significance
<br>(each one giving his own figure), the experiment was performed in the
winter
<br>of '91-'92. The results were incorporated into the paper. This paper
was also
<br>intended for publication in PNAS. However, it was finally published
as is, in
<br>Statistical Science.
<br>&nbsp;

<p>2. A. All of our experiments were performed on the book of Genesis,
so I do
<br>not understand the request for a data base with the rest of the Pentateuch,
<br>"so that we may conduct our own investigations, assured that you and
we are
<br>using the exact same text." Nontheless, we can supply you with our
data base
<br>of the book of Genesis. The file containing the entire Torah, which
we
<br>received gratis several years ago from "Mishmeret STaM" in Bnei Brak,
was
<br>given to us on the condition that we may not pass it on to others.
If you
<br>consider it important to obtain this data base, you can approach them
<br>directly.

<p>B. We were asked what the level of significance was for the first sample
<br>according to our calculations. The figures resulting from the first
list
<br>were:

<p>P1 = 0.000000001334 and P2 = 0.00000000145

<p>In the randomization test, which was carried out exactly as it was for
the
<br>second list, the ranking of P2 was 22 out of 1,000,000. This was the
best
<br>result.

<p>3. We are not experts in the field of bibliography, and we are certain
that a
<br>professional in the field would be much better able to advise you than
we
<br>can.

<p>4.A. We were asked why in our list of dates we used the forms&nbsp;
<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;</font>
<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&agrave;</font>,
<br><font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;&aacute;
&agrave;</font>, and&nbsp; <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;
&agrave;&aacute;</font>, but not <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;&aacute;
&agrave;&aacute;</font>

<p>Indeed, we did not use the form <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;&aacute;
&agrave;&aacute;</font> in our list of dates. We were made
<br>aware of this by your comments, as well as by those of one other person.
To
<br>our sorrow, we are unable to ask the linguist Yaakov Orbach, of blessed
<br>memory, why he did not include this form in his recommendation. However,
in
<br>order to remove any suspicion, we hereby declare that the list of dates
was
<br>prepared by Yaakov Orbach, exactly as stated in the first preprint,
before
<br>the experiment had been carried out on the first list. We used the
exact same
<br>forms of the dates with regard to the second list.

<p>If anyone still suspects that some hidden motive lay behind the omission
of
<br>the form&nbsp; <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;&aacute;
&agrave;&aacute;</font>, in order to improve our results, we invite him
to
<br>consider -- as we did when we first heard this criticism from Dr. Dror
<br>Bar-Natan -- what would have happened had we included the form <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;&aacute;
&agrave;&aacute;</font>
<br>Recall that the only measures of success which were used regarding
both the
<br>first and second lists, as was stated in the first preprint (the "White
<br>Preprint") , the second preprint (the "Blue Preprint"), as well as
in the
<br>preprint which was originally sent to PNAS, were the over all probability
<br>figures: P1 and P2. The randomization test of Professor Diaconis was
<br>suggested at a later stage.

<p>(i) The results which were calculated for the first sample were:

<p>P1 = 0.0 and P2 = 0.00000000145.

<p>If we had used the form <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;&aacute;
&agrave;&aacute;</font> as well, the results would have been:

<p>P'1 = 0.000000000349 and P'2 = 0.00000000207.

<p>In other words, the best result would have improved by a factor of 3.8.
<br>&nbsp;

<p>(ii)&nbsp; The results which were calculated for the second sample were:

<p>P1 = 0.0000000331 and P2 = 0.00000000201.

<p>If we had used the form <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;&aacute;
&agrave;&aacute;</font> the results would have been:

<p>P'1 = 0.00000000507 and P'2 = 0.00000000171.

<p>In other words, the best result would have improved by a factor of 1.18.
<br>Given this, it should be obvious that the forms of the dates were chosen
a
<br>priori.
<br>&nbsp;

<p>B. We were asked why we did not use other forms of indicating the date
(for
<br>example: <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&iuml;&aring;&ugrave;&ccedil;&oslash;&icirc;</font>
in addition to <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&iuml;&aring;&ugrave;&ccedil;</font>,
<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&oslash;&eacute;&eacute;&agrave;</font>
in addition to <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&oslash;&eacute;&agrave;</font>,
<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&aring;&eacute;&igrave;&ntilde;&euml;</font>
in addition to
<br><font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&aring;&igrave;&ntilde;&euml;</font>,
<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&oslash;&atilde;&agrave;
&ccedil;"&oslash;</font> in addition to <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&oslash;&atilde;&agrave;
&agrave;</font>,&nbsp; <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&auml;&eth;&ugrave;&auml;
&ugrave;&agrave;&oslash;</font> in addition to&nbsp; <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;</font>
<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&agrave;</font>,
and <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;&igrave;
&agrave;&eacute;</font>).

<p>We will try to respond on behalf of the consultant who
<br>determined which forms of the date would be used, since he is no longer
able
<br>to respond.

<p>(i) <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&iuml;&aring;&ugrave;&ccedil;&oslash;&icirc;</font>
-- We do not know why he chose not to use this form in addition to
<br><font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&iuml;&aring;&ugrave;&ccedil;</font>.
In any event, we have now checked this form as well, and we found that
<br>had we used <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&iuml;&aring;&ugrave;&ccedil;&oslash;&icirc;</font>,
the results would not have changed at all.

<p>(ii)&nbsp; <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&oslash;&eacute;&eacute;&agrave;,</font>
<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&aring;&eacute;&igrave;&ntilde;&euml;</font>--
According to the linguistic guidelines which were
<br>established (see above 1 F), <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&oslash;&eacute;&agrave;</font>
and <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&aring;&igrave;&ntilde;&euml;</font>
are the correct spellings, so this
<br>is what we used.

<p>(iii)<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni"> &eacute;&oslash;&ugrave;&uacute;&igrave;
&agrave;&eacute;</font>-- This is a nonstandard form of referring to a
date. For
<br>example, both Margalioth's encyclopedia, as well as the Encyclopedia
Hebraica
<br>use the forms we used, and not this form. It is clear that the forms
we used
<br>are the most widely used forms. We conducted a survey regarding the

<p>(iv) Concerning&nbsp; <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&oslash;&atilde;&agrave;
&ccedil;"&oslash;</font> and <font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&auml;&eth;&ugrave;&auml;
&ugrave;&agrave;&oslash;</font> -- we simply cannot comprehend what was
<br>wrong with our use of the standard and accepted forms, in which most
of the
<br>dates in the encyclopedia are written, rather than forms which are
<br>exceptional. It seems more than likely that had we used every possible
form,
<br>critics would have asked why we did not use the standard forms.
<br>&nbsp;

<p>5.A. We were asked why we listed the day of death of the Vilna Gaon
as the
<br>19th of Tishri, when it is known that he passed away on the third day
of Chol
<br>Hamoed Sukkot. The answer is simple: Outside of Israel every major
Festival
<br>(Yom Tov) is two days, so that in Vilna the third day of Chol Hamoed
was the
<br>19th of Tishri.

<p>B. We were asked where we found a birth date for the Ba'al Shem Tov.
This
<br>date can be found, for example, in the lexicon HaHassidut, by Yitzhak
Alfasi,
<br>published by Sifriat Maariv.

<p>C. We were asked why we included R. Aharon of Karlin, R. Yehudah Ayash,
and
<br>R. Yehosef Ha-Nagid in the second list, despite the fact that their
entries
<br>in Margalioth's encyclopedia are, in the opinion of the inquirers,
less than
<br>a column and a half. Similarly, we were asked why R. Meir Eisenstat
was not
<br>included in the second list, despite the fact that his entry is, in
their
<br>opinion, exactly a column and a half. We were also asked why R. David
Ganz
<br>was included in the first list rather than the second, despite the
fact that
<br>in their opinion his entry is just short of three columns.

<p>The answer is simple: The inquirers measured the size of the entry by
<br>counting lines. On the other hand, when Doron selected the 34 personalities,
<br>he did so (as best as he can recall) by a visual estimate. This is
how he
<br>selected the 32 personalities of the second list, as well. As it turns
out,
<br>it was an error in judgement to rely on a visual estimate, and the
measure
<br>used by the inquirers is a better one.

<p>If anyone suspects that this was done in order to improve the results
through
<br>manipulation, let him examine the results of the following experiment,
which
<br>we carried out as soon as we were made aware of this complaint:

<p>(i) We recalculated the results of the first sample omitting R. David
Ganz.
<br>Let us compare:

<p>The results we originally received were:

<p>P1 = 0.000000001334 and P2 = 0.00000000145.

<p>If we recalculate, omitting R. David Ganz we receive:

<p>P'1 = 0.00000001336 and P'2 = 0.00000000276.

<p>In other words, the best result became worse by a factor of 2.07.

<p>&nbsp;(ii) We recalculated the second sample, omitting R. Aharon Karlin,
R.
<br>Yehudah Ayash and R. Yehosef Ha-Nagid, and adding in R. David Ganz
and R.
<br>Meir Eisenstat (the names and appellations which were used to refer
to him
<br>were delivered to us by Professor Havlin on the 22nd of December, '96.
They
<br>are:&nbsp;<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">
&oslash;&eacute;&agrave;&icirc; &eacute;&aacute;&oslash;, &egrave;&egrave;&ugrave;&eth;&aelig;&eacute;&agrave;
, &egrave;&egrave;&ugrave;&eth;&aelig;&eacute;&agrave; &oslash;&eacute;&agrave;&icirc;&nbsp;
,&egrave;&agrave;&egrave;&ugrave;&eth;&aelig;&eacute;&agrave;,&nbsp; &egrave;&agrave;&egrave;&ugrave;&eth;&aelig;&eacute;&agrave;
&oslash;&eacute;&agrave;&icirc;, &ugrave;"&agrave; &iacute;"&oslash;&auml;&icirc;</font>
<br><font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&nbsp;, " &uacute;&aring;&oslash;&eacute;&agrave;&icirc;
&iacute;&eacute;&eth;&ocirc;"</font>,<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">
"&uacute;&aring;&oslash;&eacute;&agrave;&icirc; &iacute;&eacute;&eth;&ocirc;</font>"
<font face="globes-mcl,netextpro,web hebrew ad,aharoni">&igrave;&ograve;&aacute;</font>
). For the sake of comparison, here
<br>again are the results of the second sample:

<p>&nbsp;P1 = 0.0000000331 and P2 = 0.00000000201

<p>If one recalculates, incorporating the changes mentioned above, one
receives:

<p>&nbsp;P'1 = 0.00000000422 and P'2 = 0.00000000129.

<p>In other words, the best result improved by a factor of 1.56.

<p>To summarize, one can clearly see that the results we would have received
<br>would have been of the same order of magnitude.

<p>Sincerely yours,
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Epilogue

<p>Prof. Maya Bar Hillel raised some criticisms of our work at a conference
<br>&nbsp;which took place in Jan. '97 at Zarka Ma'in. Prof. Aumann also
participated
<br>in this conference. Before leaving for the conference, he asked Doron
Witztum
<br>to re-run the experiment, taking into account the last point in our
reply
<br>above (i.e. which Sages should be included in the list based the number
of
<br>columns in the encyclopedia).

<p>Prof. Aumann said that since the second list was the one actually used
in the
<br>formal test on which he and Diaconis agreed, and that was eventually
<br>published in Statistical Science, it would be of some interest to ask
how the
<br>use of the correct list would affect the true significance level (that
given
<br>by the permutation test). That is, quite apart from the question of
cheating,
<br>which is not indicated by this mistake, the question arises: in view
of this
<br>mistake, does the results in fact remain valid?

<p>In the short time before Prof. Aumann left for the conference, Doron
managed
<br>to run this experiment with ten million permutations. The results do
remain
<br>valid. In fact, the best statistic, P4, which scored 4 out of a million
in
<br>the original experiment, now became 1 out of ten million. (At a later
time,
<br>when Doron had time to further test the list with one hundred million
<br>permutations, the value of&nbsp; P4 was 19 out of one hundred million.)
