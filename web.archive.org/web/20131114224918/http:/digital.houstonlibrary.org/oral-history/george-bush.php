<strong>Interview with:  George W. Bush, Barbara Bush  <br/>
Interviewed by:  Jim McGrath           <br/>
Date:  July 2009 </strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br/>JM:        . . . It was actually in World War II.<br/>
<br/>GB:      World War II.  I was down there, sent down there to try to  get my wings at the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station and did not really get to Houston at that time but  I did go in and out of Corpus itself and really enjoyed it.  So that was the first connection.<br/>
<br/>JM:        Then you served on the <em>San Jacinto</em> during World  War II.  Did you meet any real live  Texans on board the ship?<br/>
<br/>GB:      Well, they flew the Texas flag when we were in combat, and the  captain was a Texan.  I forget his  name.  But that was a good connection  with Texas and, of course, <em>San Jacinto</em> – there is a  great history there.<br/>
<br/>JM:        In the late 1940s, you were a couple on  the move.  You graduated, finished school  at Yale and you were married and had a baby son.<br/>
<br/>GB:      That’s right.<br/>
<br/>JM:        You talked about farming as a vocation  when you were mapping out your plans, didn’t you?  That didn’t pan out?<br/>
<br/>BB:      Well, it turned out that if you wanted to  be a successful farmer, you had to have a little money to buy the farm and to  supply it.  We were rather naive a little  bit but it seemed like fun, and that George, having been overseas and in the  war, I think he wanted to get back to something natural.  I know he did not want to go . . .<br/>
<br/>GB:      Do you remember the definition of the  farmer?<br/>
<br/>BB:      A man not standing in his field.  That’s funny.   But anyway, he wanted to do something other than ____ [1:26].  He wanted something you could touch or . . .<br/>
<br/>GB:      Different than what my father had  successfully done and my uncle who was a big ____[1:41] from Austria.  Didn’t want to do that.  I did not know I did want to do but I did not  want to do that.<br/>
<br/>JM:        So you ultimately decided on the oil  industry?<br/>
<br/>GB:      Well, we were offered a job at Dresser  Industries.  A friend of my father’s,  Neil Ballen (sp?), one of our closest friends in life, and he said, “You ought  to not go in the east, don’t stay in the east.   You ought to go to Texas.  You ought to go to Odessa, Texas.”  We said, “Where is that?”  We did not know where Odessa was and down we went.  The rest is history.  We loved it ever since.  We loved West Texas where we lived for 12  years or so and then, of course, we loved Houston.<br/>
<br/>JM:        You started on the ground floor –  salesman, sweeping the shop floor.  You  had a little stint in California.<br/>
<br/>GB:      That was for like a training program for  selling lot bits in Bakersfield  and helping build pumps.  I remember the  steelworker’s union in Huntington Park,   California at _____[2:46].  So we did different jobs at different Dresser  companies and learned every step of the way.   We had a great diverse experience in where we lived.<br/>
<br/>JM:        Eventually moved back to West Texas, had a successful company there.  When did the seed get planted that you would  come to Houston  to launch Zapata Offshore?<br/>
<br/>GB:      We had already launched Zapata Offshore  but to run an offshore company, you really need to be in Houston for something like that.<br/>
<br/>BB:      How far offshore can you get?<br/>
<br/>GB:      So, we were in Midland.   That did not seem like a good place to run the company from so I was  CEO, you might say, of the company and down we moved, and have been very happy  ever since.<br/>
<br/>JM:        You knew of Houston then by its reputation as kind of a  mecca center for . . .<br/>
<br/>GB:      It was.   Tulsa claimed to be the oil capital of  the world but then they have been eclipsed by Houston.<br/>
<br/>JM:        You had known in Midland  and West Texas, you kind of had the idyllic .  . . you talked about it . . .<br/>
<br/>BB:      He loved Midland  but, having said that, the minute we got to Houston,  we loved Houston.  Maybe we are smarter than some people but Houston is a great  city.  It is a city that you can bring up  your children, diversity . . . I mean, wonderful hospitals, universities.  It is just a wonderful place.  Great businesses.  And we had friends there that moved there  from Midland, moved to Houston.<br/>
<br/>JM:        About the same time?<br/>
<br/>BB:      Well, they came a little earlier.<br/>
<br/>GB:      Some came a little earlier.<br/>
<br/>BB:      Some later but Hugh Ligby (sp?), they came  earlier.  They went to Pennsylvania  and then came back to Houston  for Pennzoil.<br/>
<br/>GB:      I am not sure if Hugh went to Houston before he went  over there.<br/>
<br/>BB:      No, I think he went from Midland to Pennzoil.<br/>
<br/>GB:      That’s right. <br/>
<br/>BB:      But Fred Chambers . . . we met a lot of  very close friends.<br/>
<br/>JM:        All the way from West Texas to Houston?<br/>
<br/>BB:      We knew Bob Mosbacher, didn’t we, after we  moved?<br/>
<br/>GB:      Yes.<br/>
<br/>BB:      But, you know, I am one who believes the  friends you make in the first 6 grades are the friends for life.  They are the friends for life if you are  compatible but we made more best friends in Houston, Texas,  more generous people and more wonderful friends.<br/>
<br/>GB:      That’s right.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="javascript:flaSeekCue('1');"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131114224918im_/http://digital.houstonlibrary.org/oral-history/media/watch2.gif" alt="cue point" width="21" height="25" border="0" align="absmiddle"/></a></p>
<p>JM:        And you arrive with a young family, growing  family . . .<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Growing was the right word.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      We had 4 boys when we arrived and Houston was good to us –  they gave us God’s gift of the _____[5:37].<br/>
<br/>
GB:      How many were born in Houston?<br/>
<br/>
BB:      One.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Just Dorothy.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        Just Dorothy?  Shortly after you arrived there.  Jumping from family and business to politics,  1961 was a fairly momentous year for Republicans in Texas.   You had John   Tower, who probably  picked up the Senate seat.  I am  wondering . . . around that time, you made a decision to run for Harris County  Chairman and the Harris County of the 1960s was not the Harris County  of the 1990s where Republicans were dominant . . . what led you to enter in on  that . . .<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Well, I forget how it came about but the  Party was not a tiny party and had always been interested in politics but  somebody came to see me and said, “You ought to run for County Chairman.”  In those days, we had the Birch Society, the  real Right-Wing nasty people and so, I took them on.  It was interesting and I am glad I did it.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      What we didn’t know was in those days and  maybe still, Harris   County had something like  289 precincts, so it was goodbye to George Bush.  He went every night to precincts and he  really won . . .<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Grass roots.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      That’s right, and made a lot of friends  that way.  He would always say, “My wife  is the one sitting in the back doing knitting.”   Of course, I was doing needlepoint but anyway . . .<br/>
<br/>
JM:        So you hit all 289 precincts or many of  them?<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Almost.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      I think you did.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      And from there . . . of course, your dad  had famously run for the Senate in Connecticut  after serving as town moderator, and you made a similar jump from Harris County  Chairman to running for the Senate in 1964.   What led you to make that . . .<br/>
<br/>
JM:        Well, Peter O’Donnell was the State Republican  Chairman.  I think they were desperate to  get somebody to run and we made the case that helped to get the money which was  a lot but nothing like it is today, and so I was intrigued by it, got in and  gave it my all.  Bard (sp??) did the  same.  We got killed.  We got beat by 57-43, maybe.  Maybe not quite 43.  But anyway, we got beat badly but I got the  bug and decided to try again a couple of years later for the Congress.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        The 1964 election, was that liquor by  the drink or was that 1970?<br/>
<br/>
GB:      1970.   That is Lloyd Bentsen.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      That was Barry Goldwater against Lyndon  Johnson which was . . .<br/>
<br/>
GB:      That was 1964.  I got more votes than Goldwater did in the  state but was killed nevertheless.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      For some reason, Goldwater would go to Fort Worth or someplace  and speak up against the airplane factory that was there.  I remember he went to Florida and he spoke against any help for  older people.  I mean, his timing was a  little off.  He was a wonderful man.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      _______[8:53].<br/>
<br/>
JM:        In 1966, you did throw your hat in to  Congressional District 7.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Against Frank Briscoe.  He was a very popular district attorney at  that point.  They never had a Republican  elected in the 7th  District  of Texas.  We worked hard.  We had a lot of grass roots people out in the  neighborhoods passing out leaflets and knocking on doors.  So I think we won a pretty good victory then.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      It is hard to believe but some of those  same volunteers are at the Office of Volunteers in Houston now.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      As we speak.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      As we speak.  That in itself would make running for office  great.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        So, 1966 was the dawn of the Bush Belles  or did you have them in 1964, too?<br/>
<br/>
GB:      I think we had them in 1964, yes.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        O.K., and, as you say, many of them are  still with you.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Still ringing.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        1967 was an interesting time in your  political career.  You had the Open  Housing Bill that came down in April.   You had the King assassination, I think, the week before.  That was kind of a turbulent time not only in  Houston but  across the country, and you cast a hard vote and came back to face the  constituents afterwards and managed to turn them around.  Talk about that, that period of time there.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Do you remember the details?  I do not remember the details.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      Well, you flew down and went to a high  school, I think.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        In Memorial?<br/>
<br/>
BB:      In Memorial, to a very angry group.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Angry constituents.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      That’s right, because they really thought  that your voting for open housing was terrible and you felt that people who  serve a country . . .<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Yes, the veterans that came back could not  get any place to live.  But I think it  turned out to not be that momentous of an occasion but I just think we had to  take charge there and we did, and people supported me at the meeting actually.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      That’s right.  They cheered when he left.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="javascript:flaSeekCue('2');"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131114224918im_/http://digital.houstonlibrary.org/oral-history/media/watch2.gif" alt="cue point" width="21" height="25" border="0" align="absmiddle"/></a></p>
<p>JM:        They jeered when you walked in and  cheered when you left.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Maybe they were glad to see me go.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      No, that’s not right.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        Were there any other issues that stand  out from your days in the House?  I know  you enjoyed serving under President Ford’s minority leadership.  Anything else that stands out?<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Being a freshman member, the first one in  history, I think, of the Ways and Means Committee, working under the leadership  of Wilbur Mills, for whom I had great respect.   Wilbur Mills got in trouble because of Fanne Fox in the Tidal  Basin.  He was a great man, and I learned  from him. One thing I learned from him is to show respect to everybody on your  committee or, in my case, everybody in your government.  Give them time.  He did that.   He would wait and everybody else would leave and I had my chance to  question Walter Reuther or something like that – all because of the courtesy of  Wilbur Mills.  He knew more about tax law  than anybody else, so I learned a lot from him, and I ended up feeling very, very  close to him. <br/>
<br/>
JM:        And, of course, in the 1960s, it was a  little bit different than it is these days.   It seems most House members get an apartment and keep their house in  their district or where they live.  You  got the house but you were still commuting back and forth.  What was that like?<br/>
<br/>
BB:      I think the government paid them for 2 or  maybe 4 trips back to Houston.  George  went every weekend.  But it was worth  it.  He was unopposed when he ran again  which is amazing and the children were dragged around Washington going  sightseeing.  I remember standing outside  the White House watching Nixon’s church light up and the children, their little  faces.  I never thought we would live in  the White House but we did that.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        Then, 1970 came along and you made a famous  pilgrimage to the LBJ Ranch and you went to go visit with the former president  and seek his advice.  Talk about that  encounter.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Well, I thought we were going to be  running against Ralph Yarborough, and he gave me good advice.  He did not like Yarborough.  I think he would have been happy to see me  win.  He could not and would not endorse  me.  But then, Lloyd Bentsen got in the  race.  Lloyd was a very attractive, nice,  experienced person.  I still thought I  would win Barbara Jordan who was very popular in Houston, and “If Bentsen wins  the primary against Yarborough, you can go to the Senate.  Pick out your seat.  You will be in.  Everybody that was on the other side will be  for you.”  Well, that never materialized  either.  Bentsen did a great job in  bringing and keeping people together.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      And liquor by the drink.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Well, then, they had this liquor by the  drink in East Texas.  It was kind of a mandate  on the ballot.  And huge flocks of  people, Baptists and others, came to the polls and they were not our  constituency.  In those days, a  Republican did not do well in East Texas.   They just did not carry East Texas, did not make a showing in East  Texas.  It was Dallas, Houston, West  Texas and, to some degree, San Antonio.   That really killed me when they had that liquor by the drink stuff, but  Bentsen was a good campaigner and a thoroughly decent person.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        The 1970 campaign brought you together  with 2 other Houstonians that would be by your side during your ascent – Jim  Baker and Bob Mosbacher. Secretary Baker served as your Harris County Chairman  and I think Secretary Mosbacher helped you on the fundraising and other  matters.  Talk about that partnership as  it grew out.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Well, just from that, from those early  political days, we became the fastest of friends and both served in the  Administration – Baker as Secretary of State and Mosbacher as Secretary of  Commerce.  Both did outstanding jobs and  both were experienced.  Baker was one of  the most experienced lawyers in Houston and Mosbacher, a highly successful oil  guy. So, I was very lucky not only for their friendship but for having them at  my side in those political battles.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        O.K.   After the 1970 campaign, you received a series of high-level  appointments that took you to a number of different cities – New York,  Washington, China.  Did you keep in touch  with friends in Houston?  Did you make it  back to the town often?<br/>
<br/>
BB:      As much as we possibly could.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Oh, yes, we stayed in touch.  Definitely.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      And our Houston friends came to  Washington, of course.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      We kept our house then.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      No, we kept the . . . <br/>
<br/>
GB:      We had a house over on Longmont.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      Jack Fitch sold us that property and then  we stayed at the Houstonian, I think.  We  got ridiculed for that – both for the property which they said was small and we  would never build on, and we built on; and the Houstonian was a really great  place to stay.  A lot of exercising, and  the location was good.  I hated that we  sold our house on Longmont.  Oh, Longmont  we did during the Congress _____[16:29].   We had that _____.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      It was very nice.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      It was very nice.  We loved it.   We came home for Christmas.  All  the vacations we took.<br/>
<br/>

<p><a href="javascript:flaSeekCue('3');"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131114224918im_/http://digital.houstonlibrary.org/oral-history/media/watch2.gif" alt="cue point" width="21" height="25" border="0" align="absmiddle"/></a></p>
<p>JM:        In 1977, after the inauguration of our  39th president . . .<br/>
<br/>
BB:      Carter?<br/>
<br/>
JM:        President Carter.  You came back to Houston and you dove back  into life there and you were an Adjunct Professor at Rice University?  Is that true?<br/>
<br/>
GB:      True.   I did not teach many classes there but I enjoyed it very much.  I asked what “adjunct” meant and they said it  means you don’t get paid, and some thought I was being overly compensated but  nevertheless, I learned a lot.  Rice is a  great institution.  It is right there in  Houston.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        It wasn’t too long after you got back .  . . I read in Secretary Baker’s book that it was right after his run for Attorney  General of Texas that you gave him a call and said, “Let’s get going.”  And you got T’d up in 1980 and you had an  office, I believe – I think you pointed it out to me at one point, it was right  off the West Loop there right up on 610.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      That’s right.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Right.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        And you started off as an asterisk  famously.  There was another Texan  actually, Governor Connally, who had an office in Houston and whatnot, and, as  Secretary Mosbacher tells it, a lot of people came up to him and said, “Well,  Connally is the star.”<br/>
<br/>
GB:      “It is his turn.”  I remember one of the great families there  said . . .<br/>
<br/>
BB:      She was a Democrat who became a  Republican.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      That’s all right, I mean, you need that,  but they said, “It is his turn.”  Well, I  didn’t look at it like anybody gets a turn to run for president.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      Well, and Nixon liked him very, very much.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Oh, very high.  Nixon was very, very high . . .<br/>
<br/>
BB:      He really wanted him to go for president.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        Also contemplated putting him on the  ticket after Agnew.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      He definitely wanted to be president.  Nixon, in my view, wanted Connally to be  president.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        So you started off, gained traction, got  the name out there, mounted a serious challenge against Governor Reagan but at  the end, the delegate count went his way.   You came back to Houston and I think that is when you bought your lot  from Mr. Fitch.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      No, we had that for years.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        You had that already?  O.K.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      That is when the people stood on the lot  and said, “They’ll never build here.”  We  had it for about 16 years.  It is pretty  tiny.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        And that is when you made plans I think  to finally construct but then fate interceded once again.  I guess before you went to Detroit, you  started with some plans to build and then in Detroit, fate interceded once again  and you are on the ticket.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      You know, we should go back a little  because, really, we bought this house knowing George was out of office when he  lost to Reagan the presidential.  So, we  sold the grey house across the way and bought this, thinking he would go out  and work and make money.  Well, as it  turned out, we were lucky.  We sold our  house in Houston that we loved, the grey house, so we could afford this.  Wasn’t that the way it sort of went?<br/>
<br/>
GB:      I think so.  I am a little vague on details.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      Yes, I think that happened.  And then, after . .  . lets see, who was elected?  It must been Clinton . . . that we came down  and built on our lot. We built our house in _______[20:14] and it was up in no  time at all.  It was a wonderful  house.  Very happy in that wonderful neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="javascript:flaSeekCue('4');"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131114224918im_/http://digital.houstonlibrary.org/oral-history/media/watch2.gif" alt="cue point" width="21" height="25" border="0" align="absmiddle"/></a></p>
<p>JM:        But when fate interceded in 1980, it  took you away from Houston again for roughly a 12-year stretch.  Of course, you had the vice-president’s  office in the Federal Building downtown run by Jack Steele. <br/>
<br/>
GB:      Oh, yes.   And a lot of the same people that helped me in that office, volunteered,  still help me now in our Houston office as volunteers.  It is amazing.  Just wonderful people.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      They were there in the 1960s, too.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Never got a dime.  Just dedicated.  Never properly said thank you.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        You would obviously make frequent visits  back as vice-president.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Oh, yes.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        And then, as president, you, on 2  occasions, chose to really bring the world to Houston.  You brought the ____[21:15] summit.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      That was a big one.  Bloody hot, but we brought them.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        July in Houston!<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Micherant (sp?), Thatcher.  I don’t think the Soviets were there.  Maybe they were. <br/>
<br/>
BB:      Canada.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Oh, yes, _____[21:31].  Great meeting I think for Houston but certainly  good for those leaders to see Texas.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        And, of course, the 1992 GOP Convention.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      _____[21:43]<br/>
<br/>
JM:        July and August but still, I heard it  was unseasonably cool that week the convention was in town.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      It was.   You know, it was funny . . .<br/>
<br/>
GB:      It was cool to me.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      I know it was cool to you, but do you  remember the slogan – I think maybe Jack Steele thought of this – “Houston is  hot.”  That is what the slogan was.  Volunteers cleaned that city.  I mean, what a city.  Even on the routes that the G7 people weren’t  going to take.  But they cleaned the city.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        It is remarkable the loyalty that you  show to Houston, your hometown, and bringing that kind of local attention, and  there was an economic benefit as well.   And it just helped to furnish the city’s reputation.  You moved to Houston in the late 1950s.  Thirty years on, you had seen it grow into a  truly international city.  Talk about the  growth of the city it had experienced.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Well, it is so firmly writ in the annals  of history but it grew not just on oil and gas but farming, rice farming and many  other . . . petrochemicals, ship channel burgeon.  It was amazing growth and benefitted the  people of Houston.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      ____[23:09].  It was unbelievable the growth.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        When you first moved to Houston, your  office with Zapata Offshore was downtown or was that on the west side?<br/>
<br/>
GB:      The First National Bank Building – the old  First National Bank Building.  And then, later  on, they had one there in what is now the Houston Club Building.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        And then, of course, famously after the  1992 elections, some people speculating you might stay in the East but you did  what you always did – you came back to Houston.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      Isn’t that funny?  People would say, “We don’t think of you as  Houstonians.”  I said, “Well, we have  been there a long, long time and we chose to live there because we love  it.”  Never thought of going anyplace  else.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        Built your house.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      We love our house.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        But you have also helped to build other  things and Celebration of Reading is one of the most popular and successful  events that is looked forward to every year in Houston.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      That is largely volunteers, I might  add.  I take very little credit except  that I was married to the President and the name it was given but people are  unbelievable in helping.  George  certainly has worked at M.D. Anderson and wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      M.D. Anderson Hospital, they had a little  _____[24:36].<br/>
<br/>
JM:        And you have also helped . . . served on  referendums to build stadiums to help improve the community and whatnot.  What drive do you . . . you could  retire.  You have done your part, you  have given so much to the community and the world but you still turn out for  the Astros games, you still . . .<br/>
<br/>
BB:      We like them!<br/>
<br/>
JM:        You still support so many causes.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      The Astros games are just shear pleasure  and we are grateful to Drayton McLane for getting to sit with him in the  owner’s box there.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      And the Texans.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      And the Texans.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      We love that team.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Bob McNair.  And we are hoping that that team will make  the playoffs this year and I hope the Astros come alive.  They will.   They have a good lineup, they are just not getting quite the pitching  they need and the hitters are doing pretty well.  But we follow these things.  We like the Rockets.  We have not gone to that many games but I  like what Les Alexander has done for Houston and the Rockets.  Yao-Ming, Battier and some of these others  are just great guys.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      But in answer to your question a little  bit, the reason that we support so many . . . we are retired, but just to go to  a dinner and speak and raise money for something you are very interested in,  that is . . . we are retired.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="javascript:flaSeekCue('5');"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131114224918im_/http://digital.houstonlibrary.org/oral-history/media/watch2.gif" alt="cue point" width="21" height="25" border="0" align="absmiddle"/></a></p>
<p>GB:      Yes, but you have to _____[25:57].  “We’d like to honor you. _____ show up so we  can raise money.  We understand  that.  We are not coming in here on a  watermelon _____.  And so, we are glad to  try to help but I cannot stay awake through a long dinner.  People understand that.  “Just show up.”  And we are glad to do it.  One of my favorites was this year when they  had Dana Carvey speaking at one of these things.  I am so glad we went.  We had a nice visit with Dana and we just  walked out and surprised guests.  You can  do fun stuff like that without overtaxing the body.  But I am 85.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      I am much younger.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      A much younger woman.<br/>
<br/>
BB:84.  There are certain things . . . and it is not  because we are so great or so good, it is just easy to do and we are very  interested in United Way or Methodist Hospital – I am picking them because they  have had me quite a lot this year.  But  there are just so many wonderful universities, medical centers.  People are great.  I mean, really great in Houston.  And the most generous people I believe.  Everybody says to me, “I can’t believe you  raise so much money for _____[27:08].”  I  say, “Yes, people there care and _____ and they are willing to _____.”  And the same is true for ____.  I can’t think of the names now – of the  homeless – Star of Hope.  People really  want to help.  And it is easy for us.<br/>
</p>
<p>JM:        They seem to have appreciated your  efforts.  You have a couple of schools  named for you.  An airport.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      That is a big thing.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      That is a big honor.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      George has so many things named for him  but the big national one, I think, is the Intelligence Center, George Bush  Intelligence Center.  I think that is a  great honor.  It is there nearly almost 1  year.  That is pretty good.  They named it after him because, number one,  he brought the morale back and he used it as president and vice-president.  He listened.   Maybe that is his greatest job.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        Let’s close by talking a little bit  about family.  You brought your young and  growing family to Houston, you saw them grow and start on their own paths.  You’ve got how many grandchildren?<br/>
<br/>
BB:      I say 19.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      19 or 17?<br/>
<br/>
BB:      Well, you don’t count Henry and Mandy  because they are in-laws but I count them.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      You told them that you count them with the  grandchildren?<br/>
<br/>
BB:      They know it.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Henry is Jenna – one of the twins’  husband.  We love him but I don’t think  of him as a grandkid.  She does.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      And Mandy who is a brilliant lawyer –  George P’s wife.  I counted her.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        George P is?<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Jeb’s boy.   Governor Jeb Bush’s oldest son.  A  Texan through and through.  He did live  in Fort Worth but he is technically living in Austin, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      Well, I think he is going to go back to  Fort Worth.  It is just a business  thing.  But anyway, we are very, very  lucky . . .<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Neal?   Neal still lives right across the street from us in Houston.  A great, great son. He gives us more pleasure  than you can imagine and his family, his oldest son works in Houston.  Pierce.   The daughters live elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      But we see them a lot and that is very  important.  And they will all be up here  soon but they were in Houston not too long ago.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        So if you were to think about Houston in  50 years, where do you think the city will be?<br/>
<br/>
BB:      Well, I don’t know.  I haven’t done any demographic studies but it  will be big and it will be vibrant, it will be moving with the optimistic.  It will be a great city, a great place to  live, too.  You can ask somebody else  about traffic and that kind of thing.   Fast rail and all that.  _____ to get  into all of that.<br/>
<br/>
JM:        Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, than you for  your time.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Jim, you have done a heck of a job here  and we appreciate you being with us in this tough setting but somebody had to  be here.  It is 104 down in Houston.  It is about 72 here.<br/>
<br/>
BB:      Those people can’t get out _____[30:00].<br/>
<br/>
GB:      Let them out.</p>
