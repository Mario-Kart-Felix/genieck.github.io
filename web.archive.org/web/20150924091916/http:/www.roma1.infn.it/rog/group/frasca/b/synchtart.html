                     Causality and Synchronicity:
                      Steps Toward Clarification

---------------------
ABSTRACT:	Jung's concept of meaningful but acausal events, 
synchronistic events, has intrigued and confused scientists for 
decades. For increased clarity, this paper distinguishes several 
types of causal events from synchronistic ones. Physical 
causality postulates a physical mechanism to account for 
meaningful correlations between events, psychological causality a 
psychological mechanism. Presumed physical causality and presumed 
psychological causality are categories of faith that puzzling 
correlations will eventually be explained by straightforward 
extensions of current knowledge. State-spectftc causality 
recognizes the limited and semi arbitrary qualities of our 
ordinary state of consciousness, as noted in the author's systems 
approach to consciousness, and the possibility that different 
cognitive styles in altered states can make puzzling correlations 
comprehensible and causal while in the altered state. Paranormal 
causality results when psi abilities (telepathy, clairvoyance, 
precognition, or psychokinesis) cause a correlation between 
events, although the mechanics of these processes are currently 
unknown. Being-specific synchronistic causality represents 
genuinely causal relationships that we are forever unable to 
satisfactorily grasp because of the inherent limits of human 
nature. Absolute synchronicity is genuine, meaningful 
relationship between events that is actually acausal: the 
category is definable, but may not be empirically useful.

 INTRODUCTION  	For many years my involvement in parapsychological 
research has brought me to intermittent confrontations with the 
concept of synchronicity,  an "acausal connecting principle," 
primarily as formulated by Jung (1973). 1 have usually come away 
from these encounters feeling confused! I now think, in 
retrospect, that the confusion arose because several different 
types of phenomena, some of which may very well be causal, have 
so frequently been indiscriminately lumped together under the 
term  synchronicity" that the concept itself has become 
inherently confusing. Some of Jung's own examples of 
synchronicity, for example, strike me as 
 
--Footnote--1 I want to express my thanks to Stephen Braude, Lila 
Gatlin, Arthur Hastings, John Jungerman, Stanley Krippner, Edward 
May, John Palmer, Harold Puthoff,  Elizabeth Rauscher, and

paper. The present version is based on one I presented at the 
1980 convention of the Parapsychological Association, Reykjavik, 
Iceland.

     more likely illustrating what I shall later call 'paranormal 
causal" types of events rather than acausal events. This paper is  veral types of causal and possibly 
synchronistic phenomena in the hope that greater conceptual 
clarity might make us able to deal more effectively with these 
various kinds of events.
	What we ordinarily mean by 'causality" would be 
illustrated by something like the following. I hold a rock in my 
clenched hand; at a given moment I open my hand, and the rock 
falls to the ground. We say that opening my hand, event A, is the 
immediate cause of the rock's falling to the ground, event B. We 
infer causality from the temporal and spatial proximity of events 
A and B. In this particular case, our belief in causality would 
be even stronger because we believe we understand the causal 
mechanism, M: the constant gravitational attraction on the rock 
which is free to operate when event A, the opening of my hand, 
occurs.
	What we usually fail to realize in thinking about 
causality from the experience of ordinary events like this is 
that causality is actually a psychological reality, not a 
'physical" or 'external" reality that we simply observe or 
discover; that is, we commonly project a psychological operation 
onto the external world and forget that it is a psychological 
operation. A look at what we currently understand about the 
developmental history that leads to ideas about relationship and 
causality will make this clear.
	Let us conventionally assume the independent existence of 
an outside physical world of matter, energy, space, and time- a 
physical world that exists and has its own lawful happenings 
independent of our perception of it. Let us further assume that 
our consciousness is intimately linked with the functioning of 
our brain, nervous system, and body (I shall refer to this 
trinity as the brain for convenience in the rest of this paper). 
I emphasize 'intimately linked with," rather than going even 
further (although it is conventionally done) and assuming that 
consciousness is identical with the functioning of the brain. A 
consequence of these two assumptions is that consciousness has no 
direct contact with the external physical world. Consciousness 
only has "contact" with neural impulses. Some of these neural 
impulses are shaped by physical processes in our sense organs, 
which processes are in turn shaped by impinging energies from the 
physical world, so we mistakenly believe we have direct contact 
with the physical world.
 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERCEPTION, COGNITION,
AND THE IDEA OF CAUSALITY
  	Figure 1 diagrams the process by which we perceive the 
sequences of events in the external physical world and arrive at 
ideas about causality.---Note: Fig. I. Psychological construction 
of causality.
Physical energies from events stimulate our sense organs, where 
they are changed into neural impulses. These neural impulses in 
turn undergo a great deal of modification through a variety of 
processes I have lumped together in the figure under the heading 
Input Processing.2 Input processing is almost wholly automatized 
and operates virtually instantaneously in terms of human 
time-perception. It is non-conscious. At birth and before the   to specifically program it, 
Input Processing is presumably much less extensive than in the 
adult, and the main constraints on it and the "inherent values" 
in it are those dictated by our biology; that is, the physiology 
of the sense organs makes them sensitive to certain kinds of 
physical events and not to others. Similarly, we now know that 
there are some a priori values or biases or selectivities built 
into the nervous system. The visual system is inherently 
sensitive to things like lines, angles, motion, color, etc., and, 
at a more complex level, comes with built-in values that make the 
infant, for example, prefer to look at human faces more than 
other kinds of visually stimulating objects.
	Given the existence of biologically active needs/values 
in the infant, such as hunger, avoidance of pain, continuation of 
pleasurable sensation, and homeostatic needs in general, these 
processed neural transforms are evaluated and some kind of 
decision made about them. For the very young infant, the 
evaluations and decision may be very simple, such as to keep on 
sucking the nipple because the sensation of hunger is still 
present: the built in value for the infant is to take in 
nourishment in order to eliminate hunger 
---Footnote 2 I have discussed these subsystems of consciousness 
more extensively in States of Consciousness (Tart, 1975).---     
------------
 
sensations. The decision is expressed through the Motor Output 
subsystems, our musculature, and the external physical 
environment is interacted with in certain ways. In Figure 1, 1 
have drawn a dotted circle to indicate the general locus of 
consciousness: it includes the experiential side of the 
transformed neural impulses coming out of Input Processing, 
Evaluation and Decision Making processes, and at least some of 
the Motor Output processes. We are generally disinclined to 
attribute such consciousness to young infants, but consciousness 
will become increasingly important as they develop and grow 
older.
	I have also shown in Figure 1 that Input Processing 
affects and is affected by two processes that I have labeled CR0 
(Consensus Reality Orientation) values and personal values. These 
are interlocking processes that are not important in the very 
young infant, but become increasingly important and largely 
predominant as we move into childhood and adulthood. The 
Consensus Reality Orientation is the set of implicit perceptual 
learnings that shapes our perceptions so that we perceive things 
as people in our culture do, and achieve the state of "normal" 
consciousness or what might be better called "consensus 
consciousness." Thus, say, someone holds a white pencil up in 
front of us and we immediately perceive it as a pencil. This is 
the result of unconscious and virtually instantaneous input 
processing in accordance with the CR0. Our personal values are 
the more idiosyncratic values we have developed in the course of 
enculturation, such as a preference for looking at old coins, 
noticing ads for gourmet restaurants, etc. The potency of these 
personal values on input processing varies with our varying need 
states.
	Consider the infant's experiential world. We generally 
assume there is a continual changing flux of experience, what   be a "blooming, buzzing 
confusion." It is confused because we assume there is no ordering 
of it along "sensible" lines; i.e., there is a continually 
changing territory with no map to recognize where we are in the 
territory at the time. This, of course, is a projection of adult 
beliefs about the infant mind, and we can never be certain of it. 
There may indeed be some partial, innate maps that are 
biologically given, such as the sight of a human face being a 
desirable experience, a kind of benchmark in the flux of 
experience; but it seems reasonable to assume that the infant's 
experience is largely chaotic and unorganized. The infant's 
cognitive task is to produce order among the chaotic flux of 
events, because order is more conducive to interacting with 
events in a way that insures maximal satisfaction of needs. To 
use our map and territory analogy, infants need to build up 
internal maps of the territories of experience they wander 
through in order to recognize where they are in the territory of 
experience, and so be able to make meaningful choices when moving 
to more desirable parts of that territory. The territory of 
experience includes both purely internal, psychological 
experiences and those which arise from neural transforms of 
external physical stimuli reaching the sense organs. We shall 
concentrate on the latter, so we would thus say that the infant's 
cognitive task is to build up a good internal map of the external 
world in order to operate effectively (in terms of needs and 
values) in interactions with the external physical world.
	Two fundamental mental categories or operations must be 
developed in order to build up a good internal map of the 
external territory. The first operation is the experiential 
recognition or mapping of what we might call proximity/order. 
Proximity/order may deal with either spatial or temporal 
relationships. It is basically a matter of noticing that two or 
more things go together. As a simple example, as I sit in my 
study I notice that there is a pair of headphones sitting beside 
a table lamp; they are in spatial proximity to each other. Or I 
look out my front window and I notice that a green Ford goes by 
and a little while later a red Buick drives by. Here we have a 
temporal order. The infant must develop the concept of 
proximity/order. Probably spatial proximity/order is developed 
first, for in order to arrive at temporal proximity, infants must 
have made the major developmental leap (usually occurring around 
a year after birth) of developing object constancy, developing an 
internal mental representation of an object that they hold onto 
after the object has been removed from sensory view.
	Now proximity/order is not equivalent to causality, but 
it clearly is a basis for it. I would not argue that the 
headphones are where they are because the table lamp is where it 
is, or that the red Buick appeared because the green Ford had 
gone past. Simple spatial or temporal proximity/order is not 
enough to establish causality for the adult, although Piaget 
(1928) observes that there is a developmental period where it 
seems to work this way for the infant, a period he calls  magical 
thinking." In this brief period, if some pleasurable event 
unexpectedly happens to an infant, such as the mother walking in 
and playing with him for a minute and then leaving, the infant  appointed when the mother 
leaves. He may then repeat the act he was doing just before the 
mother came in, and then look up expectantly, as if he were 
operating on an assumption that since A preceded B, simply 
repeating A ought to make B happen. (I think a good deal of this 
kind of magical thinking also goes on in adulthood, but we don't 
like to own up to it.)
	The second fundamental mental operation underlying the 
concept of causality is an assumption that regularities in some 
observed proximity/order are somehow inherent in the nature of 
things; are the result of reliable interactions among things 
rather than just a fortuitous ordering. Young children must 
strive for an adequate mapping of this kind of relationship, of 
causality, because it is knowing the real causal factors in their 
experienced world that gives them an opportunity to take 
effective action. The internal map that is developed, then, must 
not only note the spatial and temporal proximity ordering of 
things, but must also note the effective causal relationships 
among them.
	In typical practice, we say that 'A causes B" if whenever 
A appears, B follows-that is, if in 100 percent of our 
observations we note that B follows the appearance of A. We might 
call this the invariable contingency criterion for postulating 
causality. Being curious, however, we are usually not content 
with establishing causality only on the basis of invariable 
contingency; we want to know the underlying mechanism that 
results in A causing B. When we can specify mechanism we are 
mentally much more comfortable (even if the postulated mechanism 
is a fantasy on our part). A third situation in which we feel 
much more sure that we understand the real causal relationship is 
one in which we can deliberately bring about result B by 
producing cause A.
	Thinking about relationships developmentally, we can see 
that when infants and young children are presented with external 
physical situations where events cluster together with strong or 
total regularity, they are provided with material for a concept 
of causality. They are also provided with feedback on the results 
of numerous attempts to deliberately manipulate the world-to 
deliberately test, as it were, an internal hypothesis, an 
internal map feature stating that if they carry out action A, B 
is going to result from it. "Cause," in this sense, is a very 
anthropomorphic concept; a direct feeling of the effective 
results of the application of personal power. As children grow 
older, however, specifying mechanism becomes important in their 
concepts of causes, especially since they now have had experience 
with a wide variety of proximity orderings that do not repeat 
themselves in any regular pattern, making it clear to them that 
causality must be more than simple proximity ordering.
	We can now see the sense of my original argument that 
relationship and causality are psychological realities. In the 
conventional view, our only direct experience is of neural 
impulses. The experiential components of these neural impulses 
become our mental maps, maps which try to order and account for 
the results of operations on the flux of experiences that we have 
come to attribute to the external physical world. Our only  e map is in terms of 
repeated experiences which
  served proximity/order are somehow inherent in the nature of 
things; are the result of reliable interactions among things 
rather than just a fortuitous ordering. Young children must 
strive for an adequate mapping of this kind of relationship, of 
causality, because it is knowing the real causal factors in their 
experienced world that gives them an opportunity to take 
effective action. The internal map that is developed, then, must 
not only note the spatial and temporal proximity ordering of 
things, but must also note the effective causal relationships 
among them.

A appears, B follows-that is, if in 100 percent of our 
observations we note that B follows the appearance of A. We might 
call this the invariable contingency criterion for postulating 
causality. Being curious, however, we are usually not content 
with establishing causality only on the basis of invariable 
contingency; we want to know the underlying mechanism that 
results in A causing B. When we can specify mechanism we are 
mentally much more comfortable (even if the postulated mechanism 
is a fantasy on our part). A third situation in which we feel 
much more sure that we understand the real causal relationship is 
one in which we can deliberately bring about result B by 
producing cause A.
	Thinking about relationships developmentally, we can see

	We can now see the sense of my original argument that 
relationship and causality are psychological realities. In the 
conventional view, our only direct experience is of neural 
impulses. The experiential components of these neural impulses 
become our mental maps, maps which try to order and account for 
the results of operations on the flux of experiences that we have 
come to attribute to the external physical world. Our only 
validation of the effectiveness of the map is in terms of 
repeated experiences which we presume are caused by events in the 
external physical world. Thus what we validate is one kind of 
experience (that we call our mental maps or ideas) with other 
kinds of experiences (that we call current sensory experiences 
and attribute to the external world). "Validation" is consistency 
between different classifications of mental experience. The  awful, causal sequences in 
the external physical world is only a (useful working) 
hypothesis. Insofar as our only direct experiences are of neural 
impulses, we can never directly validate or invalidate this 
hypothesis. Relationship and causality, then, ultimately refer to 
experiential consistencies, and it is in some ways a logical 
fallacy to implicitly and automatically assume that they really 
deal with the postulated external physical world.
	Young children must learn to deal with two kinds of 
experiential matrices for handling proximity/order observations. 
The first kind are those in which they feel they are active, 
leading them to believe that they are causing something to 
happen. The second are those in which they are not particularly 
active, or those in which they eventually realize that their 
activity seems to have no relationship to what is going on, even 
though there are regularities in the observed proximity/orderings 
that meet the idea of causality. The adult reflection of this is 
a statement such as  I did it!" versus the abstract recognition 
that 'A caused B." Note too that the implicit 'other side of the 
coin" of the idea of causation, whether,personal or abstract, is 
the idea of inertia: the idea that if A doesn't' t appear or 
someone doesn't do something, nothing will happen-that is, that 
unitary, self-contained objects don't do anything unless acted on 
by some kind of causal force. A rock lying on the ground stays 
where it is until someone or something moves it. In terms of 
ordinary human time-scales, the rock is an isolated, solid, whole 
object. Apparent exceptions to this notion, as in the case of an 
object that seems to be isolated undergoing change, lead us to 
the idea that the object has component parts which are not 
immediately visible, but if we understood the actions of these 
component parts we would have the mechanism for the observed 
change. Thus the leaves and other organic matter in my compost 
pile keep shrinking in volume, although I cannot see anything 
taking away part of them or pushing them together into a smaller 
mass. But the biologist would tell me it is because the leaves 
and organic matter are not atomistic units but composite 
structures, and if I could see the chemical and bacterial action 
on a smaller scale level, then the cause of the shrinkage in 
volume would be quite understandable. We might say that obvious 
causality, then, deals with sensorily detectable objects on a 
macroscopic level (the bat hits the ball and so the ball flies 
off), while more sophisticated causality deals with   causal 
aspects that are not immediately apparent to the unaided senses.
	With the psychological nature of relationship and 
causality now in mind, let us consider eight types of 
discriminable causality and two types of pseudo-causality.     
 Physical Causality
 	Here we observe a relationship, a proximity/ordering of 
two or more external physical events and, in terms of our current 
physical science understanding, we can retrospectively explain 
and in principle predict future relationships between these kinds 
of events. At worst the predictability is only statistical; at 
best it is extremely accurate and based on an understanding (a 
mental map that orders experience) of the mechanism, M. Thus we  .
 
Presumed Physical Causality
 
	Here we again observe a relationship between two or more 
physical events, and although we cannot at the present time give 
a good explanation or make a good prediction in terms of the 
developed physical sciences, we presume that in principle one 
could be made once we developed the requisite scientific 
disciplines. This may involve a relatively small act of faith 
that seems a reasonable extrapolation from current knowledge (we 
will be able to predict the weather better once we understand 
sunspot activity more precisely), or it may be a global act of 
faith, a statement that everything will eventually be explained 
in terms of the kind of physical explanations we now have no 
matter how much these observations seem to contradict the current 
types of physical explanations. This kind of global faith is 
widespread among the scientific community for social reasons. 
Carried to an extreme of "There's got to be a rational scientific 
explanation for what I just saw no matter how miraculous it 
seems," it can be a psychological pathology blinding us to proper 
observation of data and creative thinking.
 
Psychological Causality
 
	Here we observe a relationship between two or more 
people, between a person and a physical object, or between 
totally internal experiences, and explain the observed 
proximity/ordering by psychological factors within one or more of 
the people involved. As an example, someone notes that Bill, at a 
party, prefers the company of older, very proper women. Bill's 
psychotherapist remarks that this is because Bill has not worked 
through his Oedipal complex with his mother and so is 
unconsciously seeking his mother in the women around him. 
Psychological causality relationships may also be looked for in 
terms of purely internal, mental events (I'm thinking of this 
because of such and such a psychological process that went on 
earlier), but we will stay with our focus on external physical 
events.
 
Presumed Psychological Causality
 
	Analogous to presumed physical causality, we observe a 
psychologically meaningful relationship between events that are 
interactions among people, between a person and an object, or 
between two mental events; and although we cannot provide a 
causal explanation in terms of the current development of the 
psychological sciences, we presume that the continued development 
of these sciences will eventually provide an explanation (I don't 
know why I thought of that crazy thing, but some day they'll 
understand how the mind works). As with presumed physical 
causality, this may involve rather small extrapolations from the 
current state of the psychological sciences or be a global act of 
faith that could become a cognitive pathology by distorting one's 
perception of events that might be disturbing and/or inhibiting   events.
	It is well to note that, insofar as we adopt the widely 
held and conventional assumption that mental processes are 
identical with brain events, both types of psychological 
causality become rather specialized and derivative cases of 
physical causality and presumed physical causality; that is, a 
need to resort to a psychological explanation in various 
instances only reflects our woeful (but presumably curable) 
ignorance in knowing how to reduce mental events to physiological 
events. According to this view, physical explanations seem more 
'fundamental" and thus are the preferred types of explanations 
that we should always strive for. Although I will not develop my 
line of argument here, I have strongly suggested elsewhere (Tart, 
1975) that psychological events involve a basic awareness that is 
of a different order than physical events, and that psychological 
explanations may thus be ultimately different from and certainly 
just as valid as physical explanations. This view has been 
developed further in Tart (1979).
	Note that the four kinds of causality discussed so far, 
especially the physical kinds, implicitly assume the capacity of 
the human mind to  discover" the causal laws of the physical world, or, 
more properly speaking, assume the capacity of the human mind to 
make mental representations of the (hypothesized) physical world 
that are extremely good representations of further experiences 
presumably coming from that physical world. Presumed physical 
causality, pushed to its limits that everything will be explained 
this way, implicitly makes the grandiose assumption that the 
human mind will be able to make representations of all of 
physical reality. Further, since practically all our science (and 
all of it, "officially") has been developed in an ordinary state 
of consciousness, the implicit assumption is that in our ordinary 
state of consciousness we can make these increasingly better and 
perhaps ultimately perfect maps of the presumed independently 
existing physical realm.
 
   State-spectftc causality  	
 
causality and psychological causality. A person observes some 
events in his ordinary state of consciousness which do not 
reliably make any  sense": he can neither observe an obvious 
order, predict the future, nor postulate a plausible mechanism 
for the observed events. But, after going into one or another 
altered state of consciousness (ASC), he perceives a pattern in 
those same events. The concept of state-specific causality 
recognizes that the perceptions and logics of our ordinary 
consciousness are not absolute and given, or the only kind of 
logic, but semi-arbitrary. An ASC constitutes a temporary 
reorganization of the mind in a radical way that brings both new 
styles of perception (changes in input processing) and/or new 
kinds of logics. The perceptions and logics are only 
understandable in the altered state. While there is memory from 
one episode of the altered state to the next, the memory of the 
altered state in the ordinary state is poor, so the knowledge of 
the ASC is state-specific. One might thus have state-specific  ate reliable 
proximity/orderings are observed, and/or a plausible causal 
mechanism can be thought of, and/or predictability is attained. 
The predictions, insofar as they deal with publicly observable 
events in the physical realm, may allow us to validate that this 
state-specific understanding of causality is correct (he is right 
in his predictions even if I can't make any sense of what he says 
about how he arrived at the predictions). The predictions may 
also deal with internal psychological events, where the obser- 
vational validation of prediction can only be done in the ASC 
itself.
	To illustrate, some of the more abstract versions of 
modern Mathematics are like state-specific sciences. They require 
a certain Set of mind, arrived at after years of training, in 
order to manipulate mathematical equations properly and to 
arrive at certain kinds of conclusions. The outsider, the 
non-mathematician, may not be able to follow the mathematical 
operations at all, they don't make sense to him, but the end 
results, such as a better way to design an airplane wing for less 
air friction, turn out to be validated in the physical world.
	We have not developed state-specific sciences yet, 
although I proposed the idea some years ago (Tart, 1972), but the 
idea of state-specific causality can greatly expand our 
possibilities of finding causal relationships: things that seem 
paradoxical and don't make sense in our ordinary state of 
consciousness may yield to causal analysis by suitably trained 
practitioners who can enter the requisite ASC. I suspect, for 
example, that some of the paradoxes about the paranormal will be 
much more readily understandable to the state-specific sciences 
we might develop in the future.
 
Paranormal Causality
 
	Here we observe reliable orderings (Smith tries to send 
telepathic messages to Jones, and Jones picks them up a 
significant percentage of the time), but, by the currently 
understood laws of the physical world, these orderings could not 
have come about; the causal laws we understand of the physical 
realm apparently prohibit what we have observed, yet we have 
observed it. Nevertheless, because B has presumably been 
initiated by A (even though, at this early stage of the game, we 
have only a low level of statistical reliability), it is easy to 
believe that a causal mechanism is involved. We then assume, as 
in the case of presumed physical causality, that the development 
of the science of parapsychology will eventually lead us to more 
reliable control and prediction over paranormal phenomena, and 
that we will begin to postulate mechanisms for the phenomena that 
will in turn help increase their reliability and control.
	As an example, consider the kind of classic crisis case, 
where a mother who has not seen her son for many years wakes up 
distraught from a nightmare in which he was run down and killed 
by a car, and shortly thereafter receives a phone call indicating 
that he had indeed been killed by a car at about that time. 
Barring sensory cues and reasonable extrapolation as hypotheses, 
as we can in many actual cases, it seems reasonable to assume  of the mother's mind was 
continuously sensitive via psi to the welfare of her son and/or 
the highly traumatic event of dying happening to the son 
triggered off some sort of telepathic sending on his part; and so 
the son's death caused the mother's dream. We may or may not be 
able to understand the mechanisms  of the paranormal in our 
ordinary state of consciousness, or we may have to develop a 
state-specific science and get into states-specific causality in 
order to understand them, but in principle many paranormal events 
fit well within a causal way of conceptualizing reality. Thus 
paranormal events per se should not be indiscriminately used to 
illustrate the concept of synchronicity. 
 
Being-Specific Synch Synchronistic tic Causality
 
	Here we begin to recognize the present and ultimate 
limits of our abilities to comprehend reality, our psychological 
limits, the limits of our being (including whatever technological 
aids our minds produce). We may sometimes sense meaningful 
relationships among events here, and on statistical or similar 
grounds feel sure that these relationships are genuine, but we 
will never be able to predict the occurrence of such events with 
any degree of accuracy, manipulate them reliably, or postulate 
plausible causal mechanisms. Because we can get a partial, albeit 
inadequate, grasp of some kind of meaningful action at work, 
however, we postulate that there are causal factors involved, but 
these factors are either so complex and/or of such a different 
order of reality than the human mind (and its instrumental aids) 
that they will forever remain beyond the limits of our 
comprehension.
	Postulating being-specific synchronistic causality thus 
amounts to an anthropomorphic projection of our belief that 
everything is caused, even though we recognize that we will never 
be able to prove it. We will get fascinating hints of 
relationships: this is what makes us consider the idea of 
being-specific synchronistic causality in the first place-' 
'meaningful" coincidences when there seems to be no physical or 
psychological cause-but we will never be able to prove or 
disprove these relationships for certain.
 	As an exercise, we may postulate that there could be some 
different kind of intelligent being than us which could causally 
comprehend events which to us must always remain being-specific 
synchronistic.3 We can certainly think of analogies. My cat has a 
very intelligent understanding of certain facets of physical 
reality, but he may be frightened by the sonic boom of a jet 
plane that was designed by the application of calculus to 
physical reality, and he will never be able to understand such a 
causal chain as (calculus&gt;jet plane&gt;boom&gt;fright); it is 
being-specific synchronistic 
 
---Footnote 3 I shall use the term "being-specific synchronistic' 
or variants of it when my emphasis is on our inability to 
causally comprehend events, and the term "being- specific 
synchronistic causality" when my emphasis is on our postulated 
reality of causality even if we can't comprehend it.  
with respect to his cat mentality, albeit causal to us. 
Similarly, we might postulate the existence of entities which 
could causally comprehend what to us are being-specific 
synchronistic events. These might not necessarily be "higher" 
entities in the sense of superior to us in all ways, but simply 
beings with a different kind of intelligence. Some things that to 
them might be being-specific synchronistic might be clearly 
causal to us.
 	Figure 2 sketches the "mechanism" of being-specific 
synchronistic causality. Events A and B show a relationship, and 
so our attention is attracted to them. We observe them, but, in 
accordance with physical causality and presumed physical 
causality, there was no physical channel available to connect A 
and B. What happened was that event S- on a different, 
synchronistic level influenced and/or was influenced by either or 
both events A and B on our level, thus 'indirectly" (to us) 
linking them in a way that created a relationship and drew our 
attention.
	Let us consider a possible example of this mechanism- an 
example that also illustrates the complexities in distinguishing 
the different types of causality or synchronicity in the case of 
specific events. While I was preparing to write the four 
paragraphs above, my telephone rang. It was a colleague from the 
East Coast calling. I had not heard from him in almost two months 
and did not expect him to phone me in the foreseeable future. I 
was quite surprised and intrigued by his calling just when he 
did, as only a couple of hours earlier I had dictated a letter to 
him concerning various matters of mutual interest. Thus the  
coincidence" involved in his phoning me so soon after I had 
dictated the letter to him and while I was writing a paper on 
synchronicity (more precisely, just as I was starting the above 
section on synchronicity proper and wondering what I could use as 
an illustrative example) seems quite striking! My colleague's 
conscious reason for calling me had to do with the publication of 
a chapter I had contributed to a book he was editing, and this 
certainly had no connection with my physical 
 
---Note: Unable to Scan Fig. 2. Functioning of being-specific 
synchronistic causality. 
 
activities or my thoughts at the moment; but it is the fact that 
I had dictated the letter to him, was concerned with 
synchronicity, and needed an illustrative example of some real 
occurrence that made the particular proximity/ordering of events 
in it seem synchronistic.
	The being-specific synchronistic causality explanation of 
his calling me would require that some event S on the 
synchronistic level affected both of us: event S affected my 
colleague's activities so that he phoned me at the particular 
time he did, while my own activities were affected by event S so 
that I not only happened to be thinking about synchronicity, but 
also happened to write to him earlier that day, though I could 
just as easily have written that letter at any other time during 
the several months preceding my actual writing. Insofar as this  never really understand the 
nature of the event S on the synchronistic level that brought it 
about, nor will we voluntarily be able to repeat this kind of 
pattern-i.e., I will not be able to cause people I have written 
to earlier in the day to telephone me in the future just by 
deciding that I need an example of synchronicity. By definition, 
events brought about by being-specific synchronicity will not 
show a consistent, controllable pattern.
	This particular example is complicated because taken 
alone, I could argue just as strongly for a paranormal causality 
explanation. Perhaps it was not especially meaningful that I 
thought about my colleague just when I did and decided to write 
to him. But this, combined with my desire to have some kind of 
example of synchronicity, may have activated some sort of 
"telepathic-agent" process on my part, outside of my awareness, 
that led to his making the phone call precisely when he did, 
rather than at any other time. However, note carefully that, in 
contradistinction to being-specific synchronistic events, 
paranormal causally produced events are susceptible to causal 
explanation in principle, even if the level of explanation we now 
have (my "desires" activated an unconscious "telepathic-agent" 
process) is crude and imprecise. It is conceivable that if, 
through more refined experiments, we learn more about the 
telepathic process, we may be able to produce events of this sort 
more or less at will.
	I have defined being-specific synchronistic causality in 
an absolute way above as referring to meaningful, presumably 
causal events that are beyond our level of understanding. We 
should distinguish a variant of being-specific synchronistic 
causality, however, in which our future evolution might develop 
our intelligence in such a way that observations which were 
formerly being-specific synchronistic to us would seem 
intelligible, becoming reduced to well understood or presumed 
physical or psychological causality or paranormal causality. We 
should also note that an event which is  being-specific 
synchronistic in our ordinary state of consciousness might become 
intelligible in some ASC, so we could mistake a case of 
state-specific causality for being-specific synchronicity. This 
latter distinction can only be made in practice by attempting to 
develop state-specific causal explanations: events which do not 
yield to this approach after sustained effort are probably being- 
specific synchronistic.
	Although any individual instances of meaningfully 
connected events without any physical connections among them 
could be instances of either paranormal causality or 
being-specific synchronistic causality, in the (very) long run we 
must distinguish the two. Some parapsychologists, for example, 
who have been discouraged by years of research that does not seem 
to lead to any reliable understanding or control of psi, are 
beginning to think of paranormal events as synchronistic. If 
future research trends continue in this direction, and even if we 
get fleeting glimpses of relationships here and there but cannot 
put them together meaningfully, this would indeed argue for the 
being-specific synchronicity of what we now call paranormal 
phenomena. What may very well happen, however, is that among the  ered paranormal, some will start 
yielding to paranormal causal explanations while some might never 
yield and so constitute being-specific synchronistic phenomena.
 
Absolute Synchronicity  
 
	Here we have the concept of synchronicity that is 
probably the most difficult for our minds to deal with. We 
observe relationships between two or more events, but even though 
the events happen in a meaningful pattern, they are not caused at 
any level. It is not a matter of being-specific synchronistic 
causality, where we can comfortably believe that causality works 
at all levels, but our minds are too limited to understand it: 
here we have an absolute principle of meaningful patterns 
appearing, but no causal mechanism existing to bring them about. 
Perhaps this is what quantum physicists mean when they claim that 
the behavior of any and all individual particles is 
unpredictable, acausal, yet the statistical behavior of those 
particles, the patterns they form, is meaningful and regular. For 
being-specific synchronistic causality we, in effect, postulate 
that there might be a kind of intelligence which could understand 
causal mechanisms that are closed to us: here no such kind of 
intelligence can be postulated. Things "just happen" to be 
meaningful. I am not clear yet on whether we could distinguish in 
practice absolute synchronicity from being-specific synchronistic 
causality. 
	Let us round out this discussion by looking at two types 
of pseudo-causality. 
 
PSEUDO-CAUSALITY
 
Projected Meaning
 
	Here we deal with a psychological error. Two or more 
events are observed to come together and form a proximity/order 
that we believe is meaningful. We can trace back the independent 
causal chain of each of the separate events and understand how it 
got to the particular junction we saw as meaningful, and where it 
goes from there. The mistake we make is in believing that there 
is meaning in this junction. We should say it was probably 
just3just coincidence, and although we may project meaning into 
it if we so desire, we should not make the mistake of believing 
that our projections are a statement about what went on in the 
physical or psychological world.
	To apply this to our example, we could argue that my 
colleague telephoned me because the day before he had been 
telephoned by a publisher about my chapter in the book he was 
editing, and he now needed to ask me some questions. This is a 
perfectly ordinary causal chain of events. Similarly, I had 
written my letter to him several hours earlier because of 
presumed psychological causality, and these causal chains just 
happened to cross at the particular time they did. The argument 
then goes that because I wanted an example of synchronicity, I 
merely projected the concept of synchronicity into these events, 
and that there is no reason to believe that it was contained in  st "coincidence."
	This is not to say that projecting meaning is necessarily 
bad: projection can lead to useful hypotheses. Quite aside from 
whether paranormal causality or some kind of synchronicity was 
"really" operating to account for the phone call, the 
interpretation I have placed (or projected?) on the events is 
useful for illustrating various concepts. Like any psychological 
process, however, if I project meaning too frequently I shall get 
a very inappropriate map of the world that will eventually lead 
me into trouble.
 
Projected Causality
 
	Here we have two or more events occurring and we believe 
we perceive how they are causally related, but in actuality there 
is no causal or synchronistic relationship of any type existing 
between them. It is a fallacy that made us think of a causal 
relationship, or even a synchronistic one, when it was not there. 
If we could trace  back the causal chains on all the events, we 
would find that they did not actually cross anywhere. Going back 
to my earlier example of the headphones on the desk beside the 
table lamp, I might decide that the lamp caused me to put the 
headphones in that particular place because I wanted to have 
light to see them; actually, the reality might have been that I 
put the headphones on the first clear space I found on the desk, 
and that the table lamp had nothing to do with it. I am sketching 
in a mistaken connection on my mental map of that particular 
segment of reality. This kind of pseudo-causality is particularly 
prevalent in "explaining away" any occurrence which disturbs us. 
If it were subjected to the basic test of any causal explanation, 
that it must coincide with the observed facts and predict new 
ones, it would obviously fail, but in projected causality we do 
not usually test our explanations.  
 
SYNCHRONlSTIC CONFIRMATION?
 
	One of the most interesting things about apparently 
synchronistic events is that they change apparently unrelated, 
meaningless events into importantly meaningful ones; they 
illuminate the humdrum aspects of life. I shall now describe an 
apparently synchronistic series of events accompanying an earlier 
presentation of these ideas which I interpret as a synchronistic 
"confirmation" of the usefulness of thinking about synchronicity 
in this way.
	The text of the presentation was run off on a ditto 
machine on Thursday, January 29, 1976, and a dozen copies were 
ready for me to take back to my home in Berkeley that evening so 
I could distribute them at a meeting the next evening of a group 
of local California scientists interested in parapsychology. The 
meeting was the first in a planned series for these scientists, 
who were to meet at my home once a month to discuss their current 
research and interests. Those attending this first meeting, in 
addition to me, were John Palmer, Arthur Hastings, Russell Targ, 
Elizabeth Rauscher, John Jungerman, and Lila Gatlin.
	A series of events happened in connection with our going  eeting that were 
synchronistic in the way this term is usually used. These events 
were so apropos to my presentation on synchronicity and to the 
formal purpose of
the meeting, Targ's description of the latest SRI research on 
remote viewing, that I shall interpret them as a synchronistic 
confirmation of the usefulness of presenting my paper. First, 
background information about some of the participants in the 
meeting will be necessary to show why the synchronistic events 
were so appropriate.
	Although the meeting had not been called specifically to 
discuss out-of-body experiences (OBEs), several parapsychologists 
active in OBE research were present. My first contribution (Tart, 
1968) to OBE research was a study on the physiological correlates 
of OBEs in a subject identified as Miss Z in the original report. 
This research attracted considerable attention among 
parapsychologists, and is generally considered to have stimulated 
further laboratory investigations in this area.
 	Palmer is one of the most active investigators of OBEs, 
having published several articles (Palmer and Lieberman, 1975; 
Palmer and Vassar, 1974) on the subject in the last few years. He 
was working with me on the analysis of a large case collection of 
OBEs at the time of the meetings, and we hoped to do 
physiological research with talented OBE subjects in the future.
	Hastings was an old friend of Miss Z, and had assisted me 
in carrying out the research with her more than a dozen years 
ago.
 	Targ also was acquainted with Miss Z at the time the 
original research with her was done, and he has had a long-term 
interest in OBEs. His remote viewing experiments with Harold 
Puthoff (Puthoff and Targ, 1976; Targ and Puthoff, 1977) 
represent a phenomenon that is similar to an aspect of some OBEs 
-the acquisition of information at a distance from the physical 
body. Although I think the OBE is a different phenomenon from 
remote viewing when we look at both closely, Targ and I have 
often discussed just what the similarities and differences are.
	Rauscher, a physicist at the University of California, 
Berkeley, had done some pilot work on remote viewing, and she 
planned to carry out a more complete experiment later that year.
	Before the meeting was to begin, we had to decide where 
to go for dinner. I named several restaurants within a 
five-minute drive from my home, and the group chose Shakey's 
Pizza Parlor on Solano Avenue in Berkeley. We drove there in two 
cars. Those who arrived in the first car picked seats at one of 
the long tables to hold a place for the group while the others 
ordered the pizza. I was among the latter, and while I was 
standing at the counter Hastings came up to me and announced that 
Miss Z was sitting at the opposite end of our group's long table!
	After completing my research with Miss Z more than a 
decade ago, she moved to Southern California and I lost track of 
her; then I heard indirectly that she had emigrated to Israel. I 
eventually learned that she had returned to California, and I ran 
across her in San Francisco a couple of years before the date of 
our meeting. We had chatted for a while about whether she was 
still having OBEs (they were very rare with her now). The only  o her since then was about a 
year and a half earlier, when Hastings and I met her in the 
ticket line for a San Francisco show. She said she very rarely 
visited Berkeley.
	It struck me as a remarkable "coincidence" that Miss Z 
should show up at the same table as a group of people comprising 
several of the most active researchers on OBEs. Hastings, Palmer, 
and I spoke with Miss Z only briefly, and she left not long after 
we arrived. The other members of our group were too engrossed in 
conversation at the time to be aware of what was happening. 
	Moreover, two other events that seemed to reinforce this 
synchronicity occurred while Miss Z was still at the other end of 
the table. Shakey's Pizza Parlor showed old movies and various 
selected shorts continuously. While we were talking about Miss Z 
being there, a short came on telling the story of Mary Poppins: 
Miss Z was the well known parapsychological subject who had 
apparently left her body to "float around" the ceiling. Now it 
was Mary Poppins floating around in the air with her umbrella and 
doing various other 'magical" things. This was not only 
appropriate for the specific OBE parallelism, but also for the 
paranormal theme of the meeting in general. Further, I had been 
in a small store selling miscellaneous used goods that afternoon 
and had noticed a woman looking at and handling a rather old 
umbrella. This struck me as odd at the time, as we had been 
having a drought, and umbrellas were not needed.
	Following the Mary Poppins film after one intervening 
film was a cartoon version of Alice in Wonderland, called "Alice 
and the White Rabbit," showing a variety of "magical" changes 
underscoring of parapsychological events.
 	Further, the intervening film comprised something of a 
minor personal synchronicity for me, as it was a cartoon of "Brer 
Rabbit and the Tar Baby," a story that my daughter had read aloud 
to our family just the previous weekend while we were on a 
camping trip. It is very rare for my family to read this sort of 
story, aloud or to ourselves.
	I chose to interpret these events as an example of either 
being- specific or synchronistic causality. Paranormal causality 
does not seem particularly plausible as there were so many events 
to arrange to give the final happening its full flavor. It seems 
rather cumbersome to imagine someone's unconscious mind using psi 
to make sure that some active OBE researchers were at just that 
place, influencing Miss Z's activity to send her from San 
Francisco to Berkeley at just the right time, and affecting the 
showing of just those particular films. What this amounts to 
saying is that the pattern of events seems so meaningful that I 
cannot dismiss them as nothing but coincidence, or merely 
projected meaning or projected causality on my part; but neither 
do I feel comfortable trying to fit them into a paranormal 
causality framework.
 	I am inclined to think that this pattern of events was an 
instance of being-specific synchronistic causality because my own 
desire a week earlier for an example of synchronicity had only 
been partially met by my colleague's phone call from the East 
Coast. That was interesting, but not entirely convincing. While 
this very lack of 'over-convincingness" was quite useful to me in  in distinguishing categories of 
synchronicity, some part of me still hoped for something better.
 
CONCLUSIONS
 
	I have tried to distinguish a variety of forms of 
causality and synchronicity. I think it is important to make 
these distinctions conceptually, even if it is not clear how we 
can make all of them in practice. Not only should it improve the 
clarity of our communication about these matters; it might also 
protect us from a danger inherent in the concept of 
synchronicity. This danger is the temptation to mental laziness. 
If, in working with paranormal phenomena, I cannot get my 
experiments to replicate and cannot find any patterns in the 
results, then, as attached as I am to the idea of causality, it 
would be very tempting to say, "Well, it's synchronistic, it's 
forever beyond my understanding," and so (prematurely) give up 
trying to find a causal explanation. Sloppy use of the concept of 
synchronicity then becomes a way of being intellectually lazy and 
dodging our responsibilities.
