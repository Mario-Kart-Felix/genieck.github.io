<font size="+2"><b>THE BIBLE "CODES": A TEXTUAL PERSPECTIVE</b></font>
<br><br>
<b>Jeffrey H. Tigay<br>

October 13, 1999<br></p>

<p>&nbsp;In the 11th or 12th century, a Jewish woman in Byzantium named
Maliha wrote to her brothers in Egypt that she wanted to come visit them,
but that when she looked into a Torah scroll she found a bad omen&nbsp;
forecasting failure if she were to make the journey.<sup>1</sup> Something
in the passage that caught her eye seemed to presage evil. Maliha&nbsp;
was practicing bibliomancy, fortune telling by opening the pages of a sacred
book at random and spotting a message there -- a practice widely known
in the classical, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim worlds.<sup>2</sup>

<p>&nbsp;In recent years, bibliomancy has been resurrected in a more contemporary
form, based on finding hidden patterns and messages in the Hebrew text
of the Torah, patterns and messages so sophisticated that most of them
can be recognized only by a computer. The method involves finding words
formed of letters that are equidistant from each other -- for example,
7, or 53, or 4772, or any other number of spaces apart. These sequences
of letters are known as equidistant letter sequences, ELSs for short, and
proponents of the method use them to argue that the Torah contains various
significant patterns of letters and often alludes cryptographically to
historical events that took place long after the Bible, down to modern
times.

<p>&nbsp;There are three types of such arguments.

<p>&nbsp;(1) The simplest is to find words of related significance in close
proximity to each other. For example, in Exodus 11:9-12:13 (see Fig. 1),
the Hebrew title of Maimonides' Code -- Mishneh Torah -- is found by starting
with the M in Moshe in 11:9 and counting every fiftieth letter until the
word "Mishneh" (M$NH) is spelled out, and then starting with the second
T in 12:11 and counting every 50th letter three times until "Torah" (TVRH)
is spelled out. Between the first letter of Mishneh and the first letter
of Torah there is a gap of 613 letters, equal to the traditional number
of the Torah's commandments, which the Mishneh Torah explicates.&nbsp;
What is more, one of the verses in this gap, 12:6, mentions the 14th day
of the month (of Nisan), Maimonides' birthdate. To top it off, although
the following point is not based on an ELS, the last four words of 11:9
begin with the letters R, M, B, and M, which form Maimonides' acronym Rambam
(for RABBENU MOSHE&nbsp; BEN MAIMON), and the clause containing the acronym
means "that My marvels may be multiplied in the land of Egypt," and 11:3,
a few verses earlier, says "Moses was much esteemed in the land of Egypt
among Pharoah's courtiers and among the people." These two verses can be
taken not only as allusions to the Biblical Moses but to the achievements
and public stature of Moses Maimonides, who was court physician in Egypt.<sup>3</sup>

 Fig. 1. "Maimonides" in Exodus
</p>

<p>&nbsp;(2) Much more computer-dependent is the discovery of hidden messages
and predic-tions in the Torah, spread over such large segments of the text
that they cannot be spotted merely by eyeballing the text.&nbsp; For example,
the American reporter Michael Drosnin, in his book The Bible Code,<sup>4
</sup>observes that if you look for the name Yitzhak Rabin, you will find
it by starting with the first Y in Deuteronomy 2:33 and then reading every
4772nd letter, ending with the first N in Deuteronomy 24:16 (see Fig. 2).
If you then lay out all 304,805 letters of the Torah<sup>5 </sup>in an
array consisting of 64 rows of 4772 letters, so that the name Yitzhak Rabin
appears in a vertical row, it will be found to intersect with a Biblical
phrase from Deuterono-my 4:42, ROCEAX 'ASHER YIRCAX, "a murderer who murders."
Drosnin, who renders the phrase as "assassin that will assassinate," takes
this as a prediction that Rabin would be assassinated.

<br>&nbsp; Fig. 2. "The assassination of Yitzhak Rabin" in Deuteronomy
<p>

<p>&nbsp;(3) Finally, the most sophisticated and computer-dependent of
all are such phenomena as the "famous sages" experiment, whose proponents
-- Prof. Eliyahu Rips of the Hebrew University Mathematics Department,
along with Doron Witztum and Yoav Rosenberg -- argue that one can find
ELS-coded references to the names of several dozen medieval rabbinical
sages and, nearby, in statistically improbable proximity, their dates (Hebrew
month and day) of birth and/or death.<sup>6</sup> For example, the first
name and the acronym ("Maharshal") of Rabbi Shelomo Luria and the date
of his death (12 Kislev), all composed of ELSs of various length, can be
found near each other in an array comprising the text of Genesis 20:9-22:2
(Fig. 3).<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>
<br>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp; Fig. 3. "Rabbi Shelomo Luria" (the Maharshal) in Genesis
<p>

<p>&nbsp;To be fair, we should distinguish between what the different proponents
of the codes claim. The lecturers at the "Discovery" seminars sponsored
by the Aish HaTorah yeshiva; Rips and Witztum in their publications; and
Moshe Katz in his book Computorah<sup>8 </sup>hold that the Torah encodes
references to persons and events from long after Biblical times, such as
Maimonides and the other famous medieval sages, the Holocaust, the 1991
Gulf War, and numerous other events. Some of these proponents use the codes
to prove the divine origin of the Torah and thereby win Jews over to Orthodoxy.
Others, however, especially Drosnin, have gone much further, arguing that
the Torah codes can be used to predict&nbsp; future events. He claims to
have warned Rabin of his assassination before it happened, to have predicted
Benjamin Netanyahu's election, to have warned of a future atomic attack
on Israel by Libya from Jordan, and of numerous other disasters. Rips and
Witztum have disowned this soothsaying use of their work.

<p>&nbsp;In what follows I argue that the entire enterprise of the "Bible
codes" is specious. It is undercut by what we know about the history of
the Biblical text, by flaws in the "famous sages" experiment, and by the
arbitrariness of the methods by which the decoders identify which letters
belong to the alleged patterns and messages and then proceed to interpret
them.

<p>THE TEXT OF THE TORAH

<p>&nbsp;Whatever the purpose for which they use the alleged codes, their
proponents depend on the assumption that the text of the Bible on which
they base them&nbsp; is universally accepted among Jews and is completely
identical to the original text.<sup>9</sup> It is essential for them to
insist on these points because the code consists primarily of finding words
formed of letters that are equidistant from each other -- ELSs. What turns
these words into messages, or at least mean-ingful patterns, is the fact
that when the text of the Torah is laid out in a grid whose dimensions
are determined by the size of the ELS that forms these words, they appear
unexpectedly close to, and sometimes even intersect in crossword fashion
with, other words -- either real words (with no letters skipped) from the
Biblical text or other words formed of equidistant letters. This makes
it obvious why proponents of the codes must assume that their text is accurate
down to the very last letter, for if the spacing between letters in a "message"
or in some meaningful pattern formed by equidistant letters is changed
by even one letter, the equi-distance, and hence the message or pattern,
is destroyed.

<p>&nbsp;The edition of the Hebrew Bible used by the decoders is the popular
Koren edition, published in Jerusalem in 1962. It is distinguished by its
beautiful Hebrew font. But the history of the Biblical text shows that
without special pleading it is practically inconceivable that this text,
or any other known text of the Torah, is identical to the original text,
letter for letter. While there was an ideal of an unchanging text, identical
in all copies, this ideal was not achieved in practice as far back as manuscripts
and other evidence enable us to see. <sup>10</sup>

<p>&nbsp;It is not that we lack good texts. All forms of the Tanakh used
today are forms of what is known as the Masoretic Text, abbreviated "MT,"
named after the medieval scholars (the Masoretes) who labored for several
centuries to produce the most accurate text they could. The MT in use today
is based on Masoretic manuscripts of the ninth and tenth centuries C.E.,
themselves based on older manuscripts. It has been largely unchanged since
late Second Temple times (ca. the third century B.C.E., as reflected in
the earliest of the Dead Sea scrolls from Qumran).<sup>11</sup> But although
the text has been largely unchanged, there is a large number of variant
readings, most of which do not materially change the meaning of the text,
but drastical-ly&nbsp; affect the number of letters it contains. In fact,
in the oldest complete manuscript of the entire Bible, Leningrad Codex
B19A which was finished in 1009 C.E., the Torah has some 45 letters more
than the 304,805 of the Koren edition.<sup>12&nbsp;</sup> Furthermore,
the text of the 3rd century B.C.E. was itself several centuries younger
than the original, which was composed over the preceding several centuries
-- mostly between the thirteenth and seventh centuries B.C.E., though some
books of the Bible were composed a few centuries later. In the centuries
between the composition of the Biblical books and the early Masoretic text
of the third century, many changes had befallen the text.

<p>&nbsp;These changes are primarily of two types: spelling differences
and other types of textu-al variants.

<p>&nbsp;1. Spelling differences. The differences in spelling involve the
way the text indicates vowels. As is well known, the&nbsp; Bible&nbsp;
contains&nbsp; two different systems for indicating vowels.&nbsp; The&nbsp;
fullest and most precise of the two&nbsp; consists of vowel "points" (nequdot),
various&nbsp; configurations&nbsp; of dots and lines which&nbsp; stand&nbsp;
for&nbsp; the different Hebrew vowels. This system, introduced in the
Middle Ages, is used today in printed Bibles where it is superimposed on
the older system, the one used in synagogue scrolls.&nbsp; The&nbsp; older&nbsp;
system uses&nbsp; the consonants ' (aleph), H, V, and Y to indicate certain
similar groups of vowels (e.g. V represents u and o; Y represents i and
long e); when functioning as vowels these letters are called vowel letters
or&nbsp; matres&nbsp; lectionis (Hebrew 'immot qeri'ah),&nbsp; literally
"mothers&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; reading."&nbsp; These letters&nbsp; are&nbsp;
not&nbsp; used with perfect&nbsp; consistency.&nbsp; "David,"&nbsp; for
example, can be written DVD or DVYD and $omer can be written $MR or $VMR.
Spelling with the vowel letter&nbsp; is&nbsp; called "full" spelling,"&nbsp;
and&nbsp; spelling without&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; called&nbsp;&nbsp; "defective"&nbsp;&nbsp;
(the latter term&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; imply anything erroneous).
The use of the vowel&nbsp; letters&nbsp; is attested in the oldest&nbsp;
known&nbsp; Biblical&nbsp; manuscripts,&nbsp; the Dead Sea scrolls from
the third and following&nbsp; centuries B.C.E., though not always in exactly
the same places where they are used in the Masoretic Text of today. Moreover,&nbsp;
archaeological evidence indicates that this system of spelling developed
gradually; the evidence available indicates that it was not developed 
until after the time of Moses.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp; The adoption
of this&nbsp; system naturally affected the text of the Bible&nbsp;&nbsp;
and&nbsp;&nbsp; the number&nbsp; of&nbsp; letters it contains.

<p>&nbsp;2. Other variant readings. In addition to changes caused by the
evolution of the spelling system, manual copying of texts naturally created
variants, some by error and some intentional. This happens with virtually
all texts. We are not even certain, lehavdil, of the exact wording of
the Gettysburg Address which was composed hardly more than a century ago
(1863), let alone of the original text of Shakespeare's plays. Even printed
Bibles contain typographical errors. Some English printings have acquired
humorous nicknames because of the typos: one edition of the King James
Version is called "The Printers Bible" because it reads "printers [instead
of:&nbsp; "princes"] have persecuted me without a cause" (Ps. 119:161);
another, printed in 1631, is called the Wicked Bible because in it the
seventh commandment omits one word and reads "Thou shalt commit adultery"
(the printers were fined heavily for their mistake!).

<p>&nbsp;In the case of the Hebrew text of the Bible, we can see textual
variants clearly enough when we compare texts that appear twice in the
Bible. For example, one of the Psalms appears both in 2 Samuel 22 and Psalm
18 with numerous differences: one word is replaced with another, words
are present in one version but not in the other, and there are spelling
differences (for example, many words that are spelled defectively in 2
Sam. 22 have the fuller spelling, with matres lectionis, in Ps. 18).<sup>14</sup>
<br>&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;Ancient manuscripts of the Bible also contain numerous readings
that differ from those in the Masoretic Text. These include manuscripts
from the Dead Sea region (mostly from prior to 70 C.E.), the Septuagint
(the Greek translation of the Torah made from a Hebrew original in the
third century B.C.E.), and the Torah of the Samaritans.&nbsp; The&nbsp;
vast majority of differences are insignificant variations in spelling
and grammar which do not affect the sense of the text but do affect the
number of letters in each verse. Most of these readings are scribal errors
or revisions made for the sake of greater clarity, particularly in spelling
(as mentioned in note 13, the matres lectionis were introduced gradually
and without perfect consistency). Some call attention to the fact that
certain phrases may have fallen out of the MT, such as the missing "And
God saw that this was good" in Gen. 1:7-8 (present in the Septuagint),
"the offspring of your cattle" in Deuteronomy 28:18 (contrast verse 4;
present in the Samaritan Pentateuch and some medieval Hebrew manuscripts
of the Torah), and Cain's words to Abel in Genesis 4:8 (the Samaritan Pentateuch,
the Septuagint, and some of the Aramaic targums supply "come let us go
out into the field," though they may have guessed these words from the
context).

<p>&nbsp;A particularly interesting variant involves Deuteronomy 6:20,
in which the child asks: "What are the decrees, laws, and rules which the
Lord our God has enjoined upon you ('TKM)?" As is well known, this verse
is the basis for the question of the wise son in the baraita cited in the
Haggadah shel Pesah. It has caused no end of headaches for commentators
because the child's statement that God commanded "you," instead of "us"
('VTNV) makes his question seem as bad as&nbsp; that of the wicked son
who asks (following Exodus 12:26) "What is this rite to you (LKM)?" after
which the baraita states that the pronoun is the offensive part of his
question. In the Septuagint to Deuteronmy 6:20, the son actually says "us,"
and that is the reading found in the Talmudic sources of the baraita, namely
the Mekhilta and the Jerusalem Talmud, as well as manuscripts of the Haggadah.14a
In other words, this was the reading found in the Torah texts quoted by
the rabbis who first taught this baraita, and with this reading the question
of the wise son causes no problems.

<p>&nbsp;The preceding example is one of scores of passages in Talmudic
litertature that quote Biblical verses with wording or spelling that differs
from the MT.<sup>15</sup> It is conceivable that some of these variants
are due either to the rabbis citing verses from memory or to scribal errors
in the copying of the rabbinic texts. But sometimes these variants agree
with other ancient witnesses to the text, such as the Septuagint or the
Dead Sea scrolls, proving that they are based on actual texts of the Bible.<sup>16&nbsp;</sup>
And, most significantly, sometimes the Talmud bases laws on the spelling
of particular words (e.g., the number of compartments required in the head
tefillin),<sup>17</sup> yet the spelling differs from that found in the
MT.&nbsp; In such cases, the Talmudic rabbis were obviously confident of
the accuracy of the reading they relied on, and none of their colleagues
challenged it. This is an important fact: the Koren Bible and all other
texts in use today contain readings that differ from spellings which the
Talmud was confident were correct.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp; As far as the number
of letters and words in the Torah is concerned, it is also worth noting
the following: a very puzzling passage in the Babylonian Talmud states
that according to the "first scholars," called soferim ("Scribes"), the
middle letter in the Torah is a particular letter in Leviticus 11:42 and
the middle pair of words appears in Leviticus 10:16. However, in Koren
and all the other texts used today, the middle letter appears 4830 letters
earlier, in Leviticus 8:28, and the middle words appear 933 words earlier,
in Lev. 8:15.<sup>19</sup> There have been numerous far-fetched attempts
to explain this descrepancy between the Talmud and the MT. Unless the tradition
of the "first scholars" is based on erroneous calculations, it seems to
imply that they were referring to a text of the&nbsp; Torah that was either
of a different length than today's text or had the pertinent passages in
Leviticus in a different order than they are today.<sup>20</sup>

<p>&nbsp;It is, of course, true that the predominant view in the Jewish
tradition is that the Torah has remained completely unchanged, letter for
letter, since it was given by Moses.<sup>21</sup> But this is not the only
position that has been considered possible, and several contemporary Orthodox
scholars who are critical of the codes acknowledge certain changes in the
text of the Torah.<sup>22</sup> Earlier, no less a figure than Rabbi David
Tsvi Hoffmann, in writing of his conviction of the integrity of the MT,&nbsp;
acknowledged that the variants implied in Talmudic sources may indicate
that the MT did not completely escape scribal error, although&nbsp; he
insisted, against modern emenders of the text, that there is no way for
scholars to confidently restore the original reading.<sup>22a</sup>

<p>&nbsp;Several traditional sources acknowledge that there have been changes.

<p>&nbsp;a. Talmudic-midrashic and medieval sources list between 7 and
18 Biblical passages containing "corrections of the scribes" (tikkunei
soferim). The sources preserve two traditions as to what these corrections
involve: some sources describe the corrections as euphemisms in which the
Biblical text used a seemingly incongruous phrase to avoid using an expression
that might seem disrespectful toward God; other sources hold that the text
originally did contain a seemingly disrespectful phrase and that the scribes
changed it to avoid disrespect.<sup>23</sup>

<p>&nbsp;b. Dots appear above certain letters in the Torah. Avot deRabbi
Nathan indicates that the dots were placed there by Ezra the scribe who
explained that if Elijah should challenge his having written those letters,
Ezra would point out that he had dotted them, and if Elijah should say
that he was right to have written those words, he would then erase the
dots.<sup>24</sup> In other words,&nbsp; Ezra was uncertain whether the
letters in question belonged there or not. His practice corresponds to
that of Alexandrian grammarians who used dots to indicate doubtful passages.<sup>25</sup>

<p>&nbsp;c. There is a talmudic report that three scrolls containing variant
readings were found in the Temple court.<sup>26</sup> The differences were
resolved in a mechanical way by adopting the read-ing found in 2 of the
3 scrolls. The need to resort to this method implies that there was no
sure knowledge of which readings were correct; hence there is no certainty
that following the majority necessarily resulted in restoring the original
reading.

<p>&nbsp;d. The MT includes the kere and ketiv system, in which marginal
notes indicate that certain words are to be read differently than they
are spelled in the text, or that certain words in the text should not be
read at all, or that certain words not in the text should be read there.
Various explanations have been suggested for this system. The medieval
grammarian and commentator Radak (Rabbi David Kimhi, 1160?-1235?) explained
that this system was created because Bible texts were lost during the Babylonian
exile and the best scholars died. The later scholars who re-established
the text found different readings in the surviving manuscripts and accepted
the reading found in the majority of manuscripts, but when they couldn't
make up their minds about a reading they indicated both possibilities with
these marginal notes. Kimhi's explanation of the kere and ketiv system,
which like the preceding item (c) also implies that we are not sure which
are the original readings, is not the only possibility, but for present
pur-poses it is noteworthy that he considered it likely and that his religious
faith did not prevent him from holding this view.<sup>27</sup>

<p>&nbsp;Medieval Jewish authorities were well aware of these textual phenomena.

<p>&nbsp;a. The variant readings in Talmudic quotations of the Bible were
well known to Jewish authorities throughout the Middle Ages. As the Tosafists
(disciples of Rashi) put it: haShas shelanu xoleq al hasefarim shelanu,&nbsp;
"Our Talmud disagrees with our Bibles" (at B. Shabbat 55b, s.v. M<sup>c</sup>BYRM).
From the 13th through the 19th centuries, major rabbinic authorities insisted
that Torah scrolls be corrected to adopt the Talmudic readings, at least
in passages where a law was based on a particular reading,&nbsp; but they
insisted to no avail. To this day, all Jewish Bibles, including the Koren
Bible on which the codes are based, contain the readings that are inconsistent
with those quoted in the Talmud.<sup>28</sup>

<p>&nbsp;b. Discrepancies between good copies of the Masoretic Text were
recognized and discussed throughout the Middle Ages and beyond. The Talmudic
passage in Kiddushin 30a identifying the middle letter, words, and verses
in the Torah concludes with statement that it is impossible to determine
whether the middle letter belongs to the first half of the Torah or the
second half because "we are not expert on full and defective spelling"
(that is, the use of vowel letters). That passage was cited often in the
Middle Ages to explain discrepancies between manuscripts and as the reason
why a Torah scroll should not be declared unfit for use solely on the basis
of discrepancies in full and defective spelling.<sup>29</sup> Masoretic
treatises such as Minhat Shai (1626) -- which is still commonly printed
in rabbinic Bibles (Mikra'ot Gedolot) -- regularly discussed spelling differences
between model texts.<sup>30</sup> It was only with the rise of printing
that greater textual uniformity was achieved, but even today, there is
no universally agreed-upon version of the Masoretic Text.<sup>31</sup>
Yemenite Torah scrolls differ from the Koren edition in the spelling of
nine words. Their readings are adopted in the edition edited by Rabbi Mordechai
Breuer and published by the (Orthodox) Mossad Harav Kook (see Fig. 5a).
These readings -- which reduce the total number of letters in the Torah
by four -- agree with the Aleppo Codex,<sup>32&nbsp;</sup> which Maimonides,
in the Twelfth Century, said was considered&nbsp; the most reliable text
in his time.<sup>33</sup> This is a point for the decoders to ponder: they
are relying on a text that not only disagrees with the Talmud, but also
disagrees with the text used by Maimonides, arguably the greatest authority
on Jewish law in history.

<p>&nbsp;In sum, apart from the archaeological evidence about the history
of Hebrew spelling, and manuscript evidence about the history of the Biblical
text, explicit statements in Talmudic and later Jewish sources make it
crystal clear that present copies of the Tanakh are not identi-cal to the
original text. Even the editors of the Koren edition have stated as much.
When this edition was first published in 1962, at a public program celebrating
its publication one of the editors who prepared the text stated: "We do
not claim that we have established our edition on the basis of the tablets
that Moses brought down from Mount Sinai."<sup>34</sup> He was absolutely
correct.

<p>&nbsp;Of course, one might claim that whatever may be the prehistory
of the MT and the computerized version of the Koren text, in the latter
the codes do work! Perhaps the Koren editors were miraculously guided to
produce the text that does contain the revealed code. It is beyond me why
God would have allowed the Talmudic rabbis to base laws on a text that
He knew He would eventually change. In any case, whether the "codes" really
work is also highly dubious, as we shall see.

<p>THE FAMOUS SAGES EXPERIMENT

<p>&nbsp;Advocates of the codes make much of the "famous sages" experiment
in which Witztum, Rips, and Rosenberg (henceforth: WRR) claim to have found
ELS-coded references in Genesis to famous medieval sages with their dates
of birth and/or death nearby, closer than would be expected by chance alone.
They studied two lists of sages, consisting of 34 and 32 individuals, respectively,
and published the results, based on the second list, in the journal Statistical
Science in 1994. In an accompanying note the editor of the journal stated:
<blockquote>

<p>Our referees were baffled: their prior beliefs made them think the book
of Genesis could not possibly contain meaningful references to modern-day
individuals, yet when the authors carried out additional analyses and checks
the effect persisted. The paper is thus offered to...readers as a challenging
puzzle. (p. 306)</blockquote>


<p>This experiment is controversial among mathematicians and other scientists.<sup>35</sup>
A refutation has been written by Profs. Brendan McKay, a mathematician
in the Department of Computer Science at the Australian National University
in Canberra; Dror Bar-Natan, of the Department of Mathematics at the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem; Maya Bar-Hillel, of the Department of Psychology
and the Center for the Study of Rationality at the Hebrew University; and
Gil Kalai, also a mathematician at the Hebrew University (henceforth: MBBK).<sup>36
</sup>Since I am not a mathematician, I cannot comment independently on
the mathematical aspects of the debate, but in all other respects it is
clear to me that MBBK's argument is persuasive.

<p>&nbsp;In WRR's experiment, everything hinges on the claim that the sages
appear "in close proximity" to their dates. It is noteworthy that "close
proximity" does not necessarily mean what laymen are likely to think it
means. As Rips states elsewhere:
<blockquote>

<p>We have chosen for our analysis a specific pattern, namely, proximity
(in a certain technical sense [emphasis mine -- JHT]) of related words
appearing as ELSs. Thus, everything is reduced to a statistical analysis
of the significance of such proximity patterns.<sup>37</sup></blockquote>


<p>Since "proximity" is meant only in a technical sense, readers should
not expect to find the names and dates of the sages in actual passages
on real pages of the Torah. The letters of their names and dates are drawn
from different chapters of the Torah, often many pages apart. Any proximity
between them is found only on grids created by computer from ELSs. Perhaps
this is why WRR do not show in their article any of the textual arrays
in which the sages and their dates appear near each other (an example would
be Fig. 3, above).<sup>38</sup> Instead, they illustrate the phenomenon
of ELSs with a few simple arrays containing words of related meaning (such
as the Hebrew words for hammer and anvil and some names that are related
to each other) and for the sages experiment they publish the lists of the
sages and dates whose ELSs they consider to be unexpectedly close to each
other.<sup>39</sup> The closeness itself is displayed by mathematical tables
and formulas rather than pictorially. It is virtually impossible for non-mathematicians
to examine their evidence. In response to my question about this, McKay
explained: "The pictorial evidence in the form of letter arrays is irrelevant
to the mathematical question.&nbsp; What matters is only the numerical
'distance' computed according to WRR's complicated definition."

<p>&nbsp;Interestingly, however, McKay continued as follows:
<blockquote>

<p>WRR don't actually claim that all the rabbis appear close to their dates.&nbsp;
All they claim is that they are a little closer than expected on average.&nbsp;
This slight statistical trend needs a careful test to detect.&nbsp; Some
rabbis are far from their dates...and in fact most of them are closer to

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is instructive to note that the rabbi contributing
most strongly to the Statistical Science result is #27.<sup>41</sup>
<br>&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;From a layman's point of view, then, even using WRR's "technical"
definition of proximity, the correlation of sages and their dates is actually
poor, even though on average it is not quite as poor as one might have
expected from chance; that is why mathematicians and other scientists find
it interesting. But from a theological point of view, why should one be
impressed by correlations that are surprising only "on average," and not
in every case?

<p>&nbsp;The same point may be illustrated another way. According to MBBK,<sup>42</sup>
in order to test whether there was an extraordinary closeness between the
sages' names and dates,&nbsp; WRR&nbsp; compared&nbsp; the distances in
the list&nbsp; of&nbsp; 32&nbsp; sages and their dates of death to 999,999&nbsp;
alternative control lists in which each sage was&nbsp; paired not&nbsp;
with his own date of death but rather with a date chosen randomly from
the list (random pairings would more often than not pair a rabbi with the
date of some other rabbi). The assumption was&nbsp; that "if there is anything
special in the Book of Genesis and the sages' names really appear exceptionally
close to their dates of death, then the distances between correct name-date
pairs should be, on average, closer than between random name-date pairs."
Accordingly, 999,999 permutations of the list were chosen. In each, every
sage was paired with the date of a sage chosen randomly from the list,
and the distance between the names and those dates was computed. When the
original, correct list of distances was compared to the 999,999 random
lists, "the correct list achieved one of the first places" (fourth place,
according to WRR) in this race among one million contestants. This means
that three of the lists in which the sages were mostly paired with the
wrong dates did better! In those three lists, the sages and the dates were
closer than they are in the correct list. From a mathematical point of
view it is interesting that the correct list did as well as it did (better
than 999,996 other lists), since there was no a priori reason to expect
it to do so. But from a theo-logical point of view, a test in which mostly
incorrect lists perform better than the correct one seems meaningless.
If God arranged the text so as to pair the sages with their dates, why
would He have paired most rabbis more closely with incorrect dates than
with correct ones?

<p>&nbsp;Returning to the subject of textual criticism, MBBK re-ran WRR's
experiment on the list of 32 sages based on the text of Genesis in the
Koren edition and then on six other editions of the MT whose differences
from Koren were listed by Prof. Menahem Cohen of Bar Ilan University (Cohen's
list is posted on Brendan McKay's website; see note 30). Their results
are as follows:<sup>43</sup>

<p>"Differences" is the number of places where the other texts spell a
word differently than Koren. The numbers under "Rank" mean that if one
compares the correct dates to 10,000,000 random permutations of the dates,
the correct dates perform 6th best, 19th best, 2308th best, etc. (for greater
accuracy, MBBK give the ranks out of 10 million permutations, instead of
the 1 million used by WRR). Note that the other texts do much worse than
Koren, but that even in Koren the correct dates do not perform best. In
other words, there is no known text of the Torah in which the list with
the correct dates does best!

<p>&nbsp;Given the fact that all of these editions of the MT are so much
later than the original text of Genesis, it is also important to consider
the much earlier Hebrew copies of Genesis&nbsp; from Qumran. Fragments
from 14 different manuscripts of Genesis have been found at Qumran, from
the last two centuries B.C.E. and the first century C.E. They differ from
the MT in different degrees. Extrapolating from variants in these fragments,
each of the manu-scripts when complete would have differed from the MT
by hundreds of letters.<sup>44</sup> This number of differences is enough
to completely obliterate the codes. As MBBK explain:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Clearly an ELS is destroyed if any letter is inserted or deleted
within its overall span.&nbsp; The ELSs giving the strongest contribution
to WRR's result together span most of the text.&nbsp; Experiments show
that deletion of 10 letters in random places is enough to de-grade the
result by an average factor of 4000, and 50 letters are enough to eliminate
it completely.<sup>45</sup> Of course, the effect has a very large variance,
as it depends on which of a comparatively small number of important ELSs
are "hit" by a deletion.&nbsp; WRR's first list [the 34 sages - J.H.T.]
is even more sensitive to the effects of corruption, as its important ELSs
have greater skips.&nbsp; Ten letters deleted in random places are on average
enough to eliminate its significance altogether.</blockquote>


<p>Considering that even the Qumran scrolls are centuries later than the
traditional date of the Torah, MBBK conclude:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>if the text of Genesis were to be consistently spelled in the
style of the inscriptions closest to the time it was traditionally written,
the differences would number in the thousands (even without any change
of meaning).&nbsp; This conclusion has catastrophic consequences for any
theory that "codes" in the original text have survived until today.</blockquote>


<p>&nbsp;MBBK argue that WRR's results, to the extent that they seem interesting
at all, are due to flaws in their research methods. There are numerous
possible forms of each rabbi's name and acronym that could have been used,<sup>46</sup>
and numerous possible ways to write their dates.<sup>47&nbsp;</sup> MBBK
argue that WRR chose only a limited number from among these possibilities,
without any valid scientific reason for their choices, and that this strongly
affected the outcome; had the test been run with other, equally valid&nbsp;
choices, the results would have been worse. This strongly suggests, they
argue, that WRR's choices may have been made not in an unbiased way, but
precisely in order to enhance their results.

<p>&nbsp;Much more material is available in MBBK's full article,&nbsp;
cited in note 36. Part of that material includes patterns and "codes" 
found in other texts,
such as&nbsp; the Christian Scriptures,<sup>48 </sup>the Qur'an, and Poe's
"The Raven." McKay showed that one can also find "encoded" references in
Melville's Moby Dick to various political assassinations, such as those
of Leon Trotsky, John F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr. He and Bar-Natan
also ran a version of the "famous sages" experiment on the first part of
the Hebrew translation of Tolstoy's War and Peace, equal in length to Genesis.
They followed the procedures used by WRR on Genesis, and achieved the same
degree of success. That such results can be found in so many texts, including
texts for which no one claims divine authorship, is not unexpected. It
has long been known that striking pat-terns can be found in all kinds of
large masses of data.<sup>49</sup>

<p>INTERPRETIVE METHODS

<p>&nbsp;Apart from the mathematical aspects of the decoders' work, many
other aspects of their method are also questionable. The basic method,
as mentioned above, consists primarily of finding words formed of ELSs.
"Interpreters" such as Drosnin then read the ELS-based words in conjunction
with words, or parts of words, that are nearby or that intersect with them
crossword fashion. What usually happens is that the computer will be "instructed"
to look for a word. When the word is located, it is found to consist of
letters spaced at equidistant intervals. As mentioned, the name Yitzhak
Rabin is formed by letters appearing 4772 letters apart. Then the computer
is instructed to lay out all the 304,805 letters of the Torah (Koren edition)
in an array consisting of 64 rows of 4772 letters, so that Rabin's name
appears in a vertical row. Then the computer displays the nearest segment
of the array, a square consisting of ca. 15-20 rows of letters both horizontally
and vertically. This segment resembles the grid of a "Word Hunt" puzzle
(see Fig. 6), and the task of the researcher is then to find other phrases
nearby that combine with it to form a message. Since the horizontal lines
consist of Biblical verses, they can be searched by the naked eye. That's
how the phrase "murderer who will murder" was found. But the codes aren't
limited to what can be&nbsp;&nbsp; noticed with the naked eye. For example,
if one asks ask the computer to find the name of Rabin's assassin nearby,
it will do so a mere two lines above -- but with two hitches. As one can
see from Fig. 7, the letters of the assassin's name (Amir) are a mere 9
spaces apart, not 4772, and -- they spell his name backwards! What is more,
if one changes the width of the array, the phrase "murderer who will murder"
will still be found in its place, but Rabin's name will now appear in a
diagonal line with the letters separated from each other by two horizontal
columns and one vertical (see Fig. 8). And if one does this, one will also
find nearby the name of Netanyahu and the phrase "all his people to war,"
an ominous prediction of what Netanyahu might do. This willingness to change
the distance between letters for different parts of the same message, to
read words horizontally, vertically, diagonally, upside down and backwards,
all within the same message -- procedures that are found on every page
of the Bible code books -- gives the impression of arbitrariness and manipulation
of the data. Nowhere do the decoders show these choices to be based on
any objective, systematic method.

</p>

<p>&nbsp;Another key element of the procedures is to ignore the spaces
between the words. By running all the letters of the Torah together, they
can then be redivided into different words to produce new messages. For
example, in Fig. 9, the words "fire, great noise [literally, thunder]"
('E$, RA<sup>c</sup>AM, spelled '$ R<sup>c</sup>M), allegedly describing
a bus bombing in Jerusalem, are produced by redividing the letters of the
words "which is near" ('A$ER <sup>c</sup>IM, spelled '$R <sup>c</sup>M)
in Genesis 35:4. In an array that spans Exodus 19:12-Deuteronomy 4:48,
some letters are lifted from parts of the words in God's declaration "You
will be My people. I am the Lord your God" (Leviticus 26:12-13) and are
taken to mean "July to Amman" -- Hebrew YULI LE-cAMAN,&nbsp; formed from
the last two letters of the Hebrew word for "will be" (YU) plus the word
for "My" (LI) and the word for "as a&nbsp; people" (LE-<sup>c</sup>AM)
plus the first two letters of the word for "I" ('AN) (see Fig. 10); this
"phrase" is taken to predict a trip to Amman planned by Netanyahu for July,
l996 (it was ultimately delayed until August).<sup>50 </sup>Just how much
mischief can be done by this method was shown to me when I was in Hebrew
high school by a teacher who pointed out that the words "In the beginning
God created" (Genesis 1:1) could be redivided into "At first the god of
the sea created himself" (see Fig. 11). Truly, by such methods one can
produce messages not only undreamed of by the Torah, but contrary to its
most fundamen-tal, monotheistic, teaching.
<br>&nbsp;

Fig. 11. "The God of the Sea" in Genesis 1:1
</p>

<p>&nbsp;Likewise problematic are other methods used in interpreting these
alleged messages. First, the messages consist of disconnected words and
phrases with no syntactic connection, which leaves them equivocal. For
example, the intersecting phrases "Yitzhak Rabin" and "murderer who will
murder" could mean "a murderer will kill Rabin" or "Rabin is a murderer."
In fact, since the Hebrew grammatical particle 'ET that usually precedes
the direct of object of a verb is not present before Rabin's name, Rabin
is more likely the subject of the verb than its object, and the message
more likely means that he is a killer than that he will be killed. Another
message consists of the phrases "Hitler," "evil man," "Nazi and enemy,"
and "slaughter." In a somewhat lighter vein we have this message: "Watergate,"
and "Who<sup>51</sup> is he? President but he was kicked out." And here
is a third message: "Einstein," "science," "he overturned present reality,"
"they<sup>52</sup> prophesied a brainy person," "a new and excellent under-standing."
These disconnected phrases make the author of the codes sound like an incoherent
babbler.

<p>&nbsp;Then there are messages that do not come true. In time-honored
fashion, they are ra-tionalized or reinterpreted. Near the supposed prediction
of Rabin's assassination Drosnin found the words "all his people to war,"
which he took to predict an atomic holocaust after Rabin's death (pp. 54-58).
Eventually, he settled for the 1996 bus bombings as the fulfillment of
the prediction "all his people to war" (p. 69). Drosnin found another&nbsp;
message with the phrases "atomic holocaust," "Libya," and the date 1995-96,
which he took as a warning of a nuclear attack on Israel by Libya in that
year; the closest thing he can report to confirmation is the fact that
in 1996 the Libyan leader Muammar Kaddafi called on all Arab countries
to acquire nuclear weapons. But Drosnin is also protected against this
problem because he even-tually "realized" that not all predictions are
definite, and that the Hebrew letters that spell out the Hebrew equivalent
of 1995-96 (HT$NV) also spell out a word meaning "Will you change (it)?"
(HATE$ANNU, pp. 59, 83).

<p>&nbsp;Finally, those parts of the messages produced by reading the letters
of the horizontal lines in their actual sequence are not produced by equidistant
letter sequences, but by arbitrari-ly selecting certain letters as part
of the message and ignoring the rest. This is a very important point: the
choice of which letters and words to include in a message is not based
on an objec-tive, scientific method, such as considering only words composed
of equidistant letters -- it is, rather, subjective and arbitrary. For
example, citing again the passage intersecting with Rabin: that passage
is from Deuteronomy 4:42, but Drosnin ignores the words immediately following
"a murderer who will murder." What comes next is the phrase "unwittingly"
(biveli da'at). This is because the verse deals with the cities of refuge
where accidental killers can find asylum. In this case, then, the message
would refer to an accidental killing of (or by) Rabin and it would therefore
be wrong. Another message (p. 71) supposedly contains a "complete" description
of the terrorist bombing of a bus in Jerusalem on February 25, 1996. It
includes the phrase "fire, great noise," but overlooks the fact that the
letters which make up those two words are actually part of a larger phrase
from Genesis 35:4 which says: "under the terebinth that was near Shechem."
If the phrase does tell of a bus bombing, why not take it to indicate that
it would be in Nablus, the site of ancient Shechem?<sup>53</sup>

<p>&nbsp;Of course proponents of the codes could argue that since Rabin
was assassinated and the bus was bombed in Jerusalem, that is what the
codes must have meant. But if the very meaning&nbsp; of the messages is
apparent only after the fact, of what use are they? What did their author
hope to achieve by encoding them? They become no better than the Delphic
oracles who told Croesus that if he attacked the Persians he would destroy
a mighty empire. When he was defeated and complained to the oracles, he
was told that if he&nbsp; had been wise he would have inquired whether
the Persian empire or his own was meant; he therefore had only himself
to blame for the result (Herodotus 1:53, 91).

<p>* * * * *

<p>&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, there are differences between the work of
Rips and Witztum, on the one hand, and Drosnin on the other hand. On a
personal level, Drosnin regularly insists that he is not religious and
does not believe in God, which puts him in the bizarre position of wanting
the Israeli government to act on the disastrous messages that he finds
encoded in the Bible while he personally disregards the messages that are
stated there plainly! (Perhaps this is connected with Drosnin's suggestion
that the true source of the Bible is an advanced alien, extraterrestrial
intelligence [pp. 96-98].)&nbsp; Rips and Witztum are religious Jews who
at least live in harmony with their theories. Furthermore, they vigorously
deny that the Bible codes can be used to predict the future. But all of
these gentlemen base their computations on an unreliable textual base which
evidence suggests was not the original text of the Torah, and all of them
strain the credibility at least of the layman by changing the size of the
ELSs for different parts of each message or pattern, and by reading words
horizontally, vertically, diagonally, upside down and backwards, giving
the impression of arbitrariness and manipulation of the data. Their case,
therefore, is not convincing.<sup>54</sup>

resolved the ques-tion of the accuracy of the text by simply consulting
Rabbi Shlomo Fisher, who answered that "we could fully rely on our text"
(Witztum, "The Seal of God is Truth," Jewish Action 58/3 [Spring, 1998]:26;
on p. 32 n. 2 he claims to have given a full treatment of this issue on
his website [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100515211813/http://www.torahcodes.co.il/">http://www.torahcodes.co.il</a>]; 
however, as of 17 August, 1998
and January 26, 1999, I could find no such discussion in any obvious place
on his website, and two e-mailed requests for clarification, sent to the
address given on the website, went unanswered). Drosnin states that "all
[Hebrew Bibles] that now exist are the same letter for letter" and that
"the Bible code computer program uses the universally accepted original
Hebrew text." He states that the text "existed at least 1000 years ago,
and almost certainly 2000 years ago, in exactly the same form it exists
today" (pp. 194-95). In fact, he assumes that it is identical to the text
of the time of Moses, since throughout the book he keeps referring to the
code's predictions as being from 3000 years ago (e.g. pp. 39, 87, 90).
The same assumption of textual accuracy is necessary for a similar reason
according to Nahmanides' introduction to the Torah, who refers to a tradition
that "the whole Torah is comprised of Names of [God], and that the letters
of the words separate themselves into Divine Names when divided in a different
manner" (Eng. trans. by C.B. Chavel, Ramban (Nachmanides). Commentary on
the Torah [New York: Shilo, 1971] 1:13-15).

<p>&nbsp;12. There are 304,850 letters in the Michigan-Claremont-Westminster
(MCW) comput-erized text of Biblica Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS), which
is the critical edition of the Lenin-grad codex currently in use by most
scholars (statistics courtesy of Alan Groves, the final editor of the MCW
text). C.D. Ginsburg's edition of the Torah contains 304,807 letters ac-cording
to the colophon at its end (C.D. Ginsburg, The Pentateuch [London: British
and Foreign Bible Society, 1926; repr. Jerusalem: Makor, 1970]).

<p>&nbsp;13.&nbsp; All known Hebrew Bible texts, ancient and modern, use
a system of spelling that is different from the one that was used in the
days of Moses. The archaeological evidence shows that Hebrew spelling has
gone through three stages.

<p>(1) At first, Hebrew and the other West Semitic alphabets (such as Ugaritic,
Phoenician and Aramaic) represented only consonants, and readers were normally
left to infer the vowels from the context. This was a problematic system
because it left many words equivocal. It would be as if we wrote the English
letters r-v-r and left the reader to decide whether they stood for river,
rover, raver, revere, or Rivera. On rare occasions, certain long vowels
were indicated. To indicate them, a few of the consonants were used as
matres lectionis to represent the vowels that sounded like those consonants;
the consonant Y, in particular, was also used for the vowel sound /i/.

<p>(2) In the second stage this sporadic use of consonants was expanded
and four different consonants were used more frequently to indicate vowels.
VAV, originally pronounced like a w, was also employed as a vowel to indicate
certain /u/'s and /o/'s (e.g. LNV = LANU; XWRC = XOREC); ALEPH (pronounced
consonantly as a glottal stop)&nbsp; represented certain other /o/'s and
/u/'s (e.g. R'$&nbsp; = RO$; H' = HU); YOD repre-sented /i/ and certain
/e/'s (e.g. 'DNY =&nbsp; ADONI;&nbsp; BYT = BET); and HEH (pro-nounced
consonantally as h) represented /a/ and certain other /o/'s and /e/'s (e.g.
HYH&nbsp; = HAYAH;<sup> c</sup>BDH =&nbsp; <sup>c</sup>ABDO; ZH = ZEH).
This stage began around the tenth century B.C.E. in Aramaic, and later
spread to Hebrew. It was a gradual development, used at first for long
vowels at the end of words, and later, but less frequently, within words
as well. This system was a major help for readers, but it was imperfect
for three reasons: first, there weren't enough suitable consonants, so
each of them had to represent more than one vowel; second, they were not
consistently used -- sometimes a vowel would be indicated, sometimes not
("full" and "defective" spelling, as explained above); and third, those
letters continued to represent consonants as well as vowels, creating a
certain amount of ambiguity.

<p>(3) Finally, much later, some time between the sixth and eighth centuries
C.E., the system of diacritical "points" -- dots and dashes above and below
the letters -- was invented to represent the vowels. This created a certain
amount of redundancy since the vowel letters of the second stage continued
to be used alongside the diacriticals, but it led to greater clarity.

<p>&nbsp;Let me exemplify. In the Gezer Calendar, the oldest known Hebrew
inscription from Biblical times, the word meaning harvest, QACIR, is spelled
Q-C-R&nbsp; (see the boxed word in Fig. 4). The internal vowel /i/ is not
shown. In Masoretic Torah scrolls, it is spelled Q-C-Y-R, with the vowel
/i/ represented by Y (see the boxed word in Fig. 5 left). In Bibles with
diacritical vowel points, the same letters are used, but the diacrit-ical
signs are added above and below the letters (see the boxed word in Fig.
5 right; all three types of spelling are represented in English characters
in Fig. 4, lower right).

Fig. 5. Selection from a Torah scroll and a printed Bible
<br>&nbsp;with diacritical vowels and cantillation signs
</p>

<p>&nbsp;Now the Gezer Calendar comes from the 10th century B.C.E., approximately
three centuries after Moses. Its non-representation of the internal vowel
is characteristic of the West Semitic writing that we know from that early
period. It is clear that the Bible texts we use today, which usually include
matres lectionis to represent long vowels at the end of words and often
within the words, reflect a post-Mosaic system of spelling (again, see
Fig. 5). The spelling&nbsp; in&nbsp; manuscripts&nbsp; of&nbsp; Moses's
time&nbsp; would have looked very different from that in the Masoretic
Text of today, which contains thousands of vowel letters that would not
have been used in Moses's time.

highlighted, in Abba Bendavid, Makbilot BaMikra' (Parallels in the Bible)
(Jerusalem: Carta, 1972), p. 61-62. Kimhi held that such differences as
Dodanim in Gen. 10:4 vs. Rodanim in 1 Chron. 1:7, and Deuel in Num. 1:14
vs. Reuel in 2:14 are due to confusion of similar letters, but he held
that the confusion took place in pre-Biblical texts and that the Bible
intentionally preserved both forms to show that they referred to the same
peoples or persons; there was no confusion in the transmission of the Bible
itself (see his comments to Gen. 10:4 and 1 Chron. 1:7, and Uriel Simon,
"Ibn Ezra and Kimhi -- Two Approaches to the Question of the Accuracy of
the Masoretic Text," Bar Ilan 6 (1968):208-209).

<br>&nbsp;16. For example, in Bavli Berakhot 61a R. Nahman bar Yitzhak
quotes a passage that is not present in the MT: VYLK 'LQNH 'XRY '$TV, "and
Elkanah walked after his wife." This passage, if it existed, would have
belonged in 1 Samuel 1 or 2. It is also absent in the Septuagint and in
the partially preserved fragments of Samuel from Qumran. However, both
of these versions of the text include other extra phrases not found in
the MT (in 1 Samuel 1:22 a Qumran fragment reads: "And I shall give him
as a Nazirite forever all the days of his life,"&nbsp; and in v. 18, after
"the woman went her way," the Septuagint adds: "and entered the chamber
and ate with her husband and drank"). This suggests that R. Nahman bar
Yitzhak was quoting from a text of Samuel known to him. (For the Qumran
text see F.M. Cross, "A New Qumran Biblical Fragment Related to the Original
Hebrew Underlying the Septuagint," Bulletin of the American Schools of
Oriental Research 132 [1953]:15-26.

<p>&nbsp;17. The precept of tefillin is based on Exodus 13:9 and 16 and
Deuteronomy 6:8 and 11:18. The word totafot, "frontlets, headbands," referring
to the tefillin worn on the head, appears in three of these verses. According
to Rabbi Ishmael in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 4b and parallels), the suffix
-OT is spelled defectively (that is, without the vowel letter VAV) in the
first two occurrences and fully (with the VAV) the third time. This allows
the first two to be read "as if" they were singulars, implying one compartment
each, and requires the third to be read as a plural, hence requiring two
compartments, and thus indicating that the head tefillin must have a total
of four compartments. However, in all known copies of the Bible, both ancient
(with one exception, in Exodus 13:16)&nbsp; and Masoretic, the suffix is
spelled defectively all three times, and this is how Maimonides rules that
they must be written (Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Tefillin 2:7, presumably following
the Aleppo Codex). For the ancient manuscripts see J. Tigay, "On&nbsp;
the&nbsp; Meaning&nbsp; of totafot,"&nbsp;&nbsp; Journal&nbsp; of&nbsp;
Biblical Literature 101 (1982):321. For other such examples see Leiman,
cited in the next note.

<p>&nbsp;19. S. Rosenfeld, Sefer Mishpahat Sofrim (Vilna: Romm, 1883),
34-36, 100, who identifies the middle letter as the ALEPH in the word HU',
in Lev. 8:28 (the same is true for the Koren edition), and the middle pair
of words as 'EL YESOD in Lev. 8:15. According to the Talmud, the middle
letter is the VAV in the word GAXON in Lev. 11:42, and the middle words
are DAROSH DARASH in Lev. 10:16. The inconsistency between the Talmudic
passage and the MT of today is also noted by Barukh HaLevi Epstein, Torah
Temimah, at Lev. 11:42 and M.M. Kasher, Torah Shelemah 28 (Jerusalem: American
Biblical Encyclopedia Society/Makhon Torah Shelemah, 1978), pp. 286-289.
In the Yemenite text the middle letter is the L of LYHVH in Lev. 8:28;
according to Alan Groves, in BHS, which has an even number of letters,
the middle two letters are HX in HXZH, also in Lev. 8:28. Witztum claims
to have dealt with the passage in Kiddushin 30a on his website but, as
noted above in note 9, I could find no such discussion there.

<p>&nbsp;20. For the latter possibility one may compare the Septuagint
of Exodus 35-40, which is based on a Hebrew original that had many passages
in a different order than in the MT. But if this is the case in the text
to which the "first scholars" were referring, it was, without the rabbis
realizing it, from a textual tradition other than the one that was current
in rabbinic cir-cles.

Leiman (above, note 18) and Levy (below, n. 28). In view of the spell-ing
variations in Torah manuscripts, the late Rabbi Yaakov Weinberg, Rosh Yeshiva
of Yeshivat Ner Yisrael, wrote:

<p>Rambam knew very well that these variations existed...The words of Ani
Ma'amin and the words of the Rambam [in his commentary on Mishnah Sanhedrin
10:1] "the entire Torah in our possession today" [is the one that Moses
received from God] must not be taken literally, implying that all the letters
of the present Torah are the exact letters given to Moshe Rabbeinu. Rather,
it should be understood in a general sense that the Torah we learn and
live by is for all intents and purposes the same Torah that was given to
Moshe Rabbeinu.

Word in Jewish Theology?" The Torah U-Madda Journal 4 (1993):203 (for our
purposes R. Weinberg's view is important whether or not Maimonides intended
his words to be taken literally). (Ironically, R. Weinberg's book is listed

pp. 64-67; Ginsburg, Introduction, pp. 347-363. Examples are in Gen. 18:22
(see also Rashi) and 1 Sam. 3:13, "committed sacrilege at will/for themselves"
(LHM), where Radak records a tikkun soferim to avoid saying&nbsp; "com-mitted
sacrilege against God" ('L, or 'LHYM), as the Septuagint actually reads
(Tanakh [Jewish Publication Society] ad loc., note a-a). Lieberman shows
that the views that these readings are original euphemisms (kinnah(u) hakatuv)
and scribal corrections (tikkun soferim) are distinct and divergent traditions
and should not be harmonized so that one becomes just another way of referring
to the other. The view that they are original euphemisms appears in tannaitic
sources; the view that the scribes actually changed the original text is
first expressed by Rabbi Joshua b. Levi (first half of third century):
"It is a correction of the scribes; (the word <sup>c</sup>YNW, 'his eye,
in Zechariah 2:12) was (originally) written with a yod (i.e., <sup>c</sup>YNY,
'My eye')" (Shemot Rabbah 13:1). Note also the Masoretic list cited by
Ginsburg, Introduc-tion, p. 351 n. 2, which explicitly states that in each
case something else "was written" in place of the current reading in the
MT.

<p>&nbsp;The Talmud also lists 5 words containing "omissions of the scribes"
(ittur soferim) in which the scribes omitted the one-letter conjunction
vav (Ginsburg, Introduction, pp. 308-309; Tov, p. 67; see Tosafot, the

<p>&nbsp;34. M. Medan, "Al haNusah beMahadurat Koren," Beth Mikra 3 (15),
Jan. 1963:142.&nbsp; It is worth keeping in mind that the decoders do not
work directly with the Koren edition, but with a computerized version of
its text, which could contain errors. There is at least as much room for
human error in typing the text into the computer as there has always been
in copying texts manually (and in setting them in type). Anybody familiar
with how frequently errors can still be found in Torah scrolls, even though
they are written by experienced scribes following exacting procedures,
understands this. Rabbi David Greenfield of the Vaad Mishmeret Stam in
New York (an organization of scribes that checks Torah scrolls for errors)
informs me that errors are found in more than half the scrolls checked,
and in&nbsp; more than 90% of those written since World War II (the Vaad
now uses computer scanners to check for errors, and when it first received
an electronic text of the Torah to use as the standard, 10-15 errors were
found in it!). A sobering case in point is an article published in 1981
by Gerard E. Weil, an expert on the Masorah who edited the Masorah of BHS.
Weil's article, based on a computerized version of the text that he prepared,
gives the total number of letters in the Leningrad Codex's text of the
Torah, and the total number of occurrences of each letter of the Hebrew
alphabet ("Les decomptes de versets, mots et lettres du Pentateuque selon
le manuscrit N 19a de Leningrad," in P. Casetti et al. eds., Melanges Dominique
Barthelemy [Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ru-precht, 1981], pp. 651-703).
But the Michigan-Claremont-Westminster (MCW) text of BHS, prepared independently
of Weil's, gives different totals for the whole Torah (304,850 versus Weil's
304,848) and for 14 of the letters of the alphabet. Alan Groves, the final
editor of the MCW,&nbsp; text tells me that in every case where a consonantal
difference was found between it and Weil's text, Weil's was found to be
wrong. Before concluding that the computerized ver-sion of the Koren text
reproduces even Koren itself accurately, one would desire some evi-dence
of how carefully, and how many times, it was checked against the original
Koren text.

<p>&nbsp;40. E-mail letter of 5 May, 1998. On the same date, Bar-Hillel,
responded in a similar vein:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>[T]he result WRR published is not really that rabbis are close
to their dates, but rather that a large list of rabbis paired with their
own dates are closer, on average [my empha-sis - J.H.T.], than lots and
lots of lists where rabbis were paired with someone else's dates.&nbsp;
So it is a comparative assertion, not an absolute one.&nbsp; To be sure,
their rationale requires actual proximity, and they devised a complex measure
of alleged proximity, but the "miracle" is not in the absolute proximities,
but rather in relative proximities.&nbsp; In other words, even though the
rabbis yield very few "pretty pictures" with their own dates, there may
be even fewer with other dates. Paradoxically, even that is not the case...but
as per the race they ran between lists, the correct list did almost best.
Poorly, by the measure of 'pretty pictures,' but almost best."</blockquote>

and Solution," in Chance 11 (1998):15.

<p>&nbsp;43. E-mail letter of 26 May, 1998.

<p>&nbsp;44. 4QGenesis<sup>b</sup> is a possible exception. It has one
difference in the 1200 surviving letters. If variants were evenly distributed
through the entire manuscript, this would imply a difference of about 65
letters in all of Genesis. This would make the scroll quite anomalous among
the Qumran fragments, and it may be that the surviving fragments are accidentally
closer to the MT than the rest of the manuscript was. But even assuming
a mere 65 letters of difference from the MT, that is enough to completely
obliterate the codes, as we shall see below.

<p>&nbsp;45. According to cryptographer Harold Gans, 78 deleted letters
are necessary to oblit-erate the statistical significance of the codes
(Satinover, Cracking the Bible Code, p. 224). For present purposes, this
makes no difference.

<p>&nbsp;46. For example, Rabbi Hayyim Benveniste's name can be written:
BNBN$TY, HRB HXBY"B, HRB XBY"B, RB XBY"B, or RBY XYYM. Other&nbsp; have
even more possible appel-lations, including the names of their major books,
sometimes preceded by B<sup>c</sup>L, sometimes not.

<p>&nbsp;47. For example, ALEF TISHREI, B'ALEF TISHREI, ALEF B'TISHREI,
B'ALEF B'TISHREI, ALEF L'TISHREI, B'ALEF L'TISHREI, ALEF SHEL TISHREI,
B'ALEF SHEL TISHREI.

<p>&nbsp;48. Christians have also begun to claim that Christological messages
can be found encoded in the Tanakh as well. For example, Grant R. Jeffrey,
The Mysterious Bible Codes (Nashville: Word Publishing, 1998), chaps. 6-8,
finds ELS-based references to Jesus, Mary, and some of Jesus's disciples
in Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, and elsewhere (ref. courtesy of&nbsp; Chanan and
Yisrael Tigay).

<p>&nbsp;49. See A.M. Hasofer, "Codes in the Torah: A Rejoinder," in B'Or
Ha'Torah 8 (1993/5743), pp. 121-131 (published by "Shamir," the Association
of Religious Professionals from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in
Israel, POB 5749, Jerusalem, Israel).

see R. Hendel, "The Bible Code: Cracked and Crumbling," Bible Review 13/4
(August, 1997), p. 23.

<p>&nbsp;51. Who is "he"? The text never mentions Nixon's name! Actually,
the spelling (MHV) would more likely mean: What is he/it?

<p>&nbsp;52. Who? Drosnin never explains.

<p>&nbsp;53. On pp. 58 and 80, Drosnin's rendering "after the death of
prime minister" ignores the intervening word 'B, "father," which would
make the message mean "after the death of the father of the prime minister"
(later in the book, on p. 161, he includes 'B, reading the passage as:
"Another will die, Av [i.e., the Hebrew month of Av], prime minister."
On p. 54 he ignores what follows "all his people to war": "to Jahaz, and
the Lord our God delivered him to us and we defeated him..." (Deut. 2:32-33).
