    <meta name="description" content="William Colby was a high-ranking CIA officer during the Vietnam War. He would later direct the Agency. Here he recalls the CIA’s assessment of the Vietnam War in 1965 and the failure of the US to anticipate the Tet Offensive. He discusses the Phoenix Program, which he directed, describing its impact on the War. Finally, he recounts events surrounding the Fall of Saigon and the end of the War, and reflects on the success or failure of US strategy in Vietnam."/>

With that, and the fact that we were aware that the North Vietnamese were sending regular troop units down from about <span class="tei-date" title="1964-10">October of '64</span> on, it was quite clear in our minds that the, the fall of Vietnam, South Vietnam would occur, probably by the end of <span class="tei-date" title="1965">1965</span> or early <span class="tei-date" title="1966">1966</span>.<div class="tei-metadata"><div id="CIA">United States.

Ah. There was a feeling in American officialdom that we should do to the north what they were doing to our friends in the south, and ah, that the vehicle was the bombing. I always thought that the key to the war in Vietnam was in the villages of Vietnam, that to the degree to which the villagers took their own responsibility to protect themselves you would not have a guerrilla base for the enemy and you would not have the kind of chaos that otherwise would exist. I felt the bombing of the north was kind of irrelevant to that major strategic objective.<div class="tei-metadata">

        <div><strong>Description</strong> William Colby was a high-ranking CIA officer during the Vietnam War. He would later direct the Agency. Here he recalls the CIA’s assessment of the Vietnam War in 1965 and the failure of the US to anticipate the Tet Offensive. He discusses the Phoenix Program, which he directed, describing its impact on the War. Finally, he recounts events surrounding the Fall of Saigon and the end of the War, and reflects on the success or failure of US strategy in Vietnam.</div>
