<p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">by  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100103081231/http://crimemagazine.com/authors/mel_ayton.htm">Mel Ayton</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">F</span></b>or most Americans over 45 the images are still vivid â€“  Robert Kennedy shaking hands with kitchen staff of the Los Angeles Ambassador  Hotel; Kennedy lying in a pool of his own blood; Kennedy's unofficial bodyguards  and friends grabbing the young Palestinian, Sirhan Sirhan, as he rapidly fired  off his pistol shots before he could be subdued; the prostrate bodies of the  other victims, wounded by Sirhan's obsessive intent in hitting Kennedy; the  nation once again mourning the loss of another American hero dead before his  time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">What Robert Kennedy might have done as president is one of  history's great-unanswered questions. His death also prompted many to ask â€“ why  was he murdered?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although the grief over Robert Kennedy's death has  subsided over the years, the suspicious circumstances about the assassination  have grown. Opinion polls over the past 35 years have shown that a majority of  Americans believe his murder was part of a larger conspiracy. The list of  culprits has grown as the years have passed, including organized crime, who  wanted Kennedy dead because of his crack-down on the mob, the  military-industrial complex, who feared he would put an end to the war in  Vietnam, rogue elements of the CIA bent on revenge for the Kennedy brothers'  abandonment of the Bay of Pigs exiles during their 1961 invasion of Cuba,  Western ranchers upset with his support for migrant farm workers, the KKK and  the American Nazi party, upset with his support for civil rights, and a Greek  shipping magnet who wanted to rid himself of his 'nemesis'.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The issue of conspiracy began on the night when Robert  Kennedy was shot and witnesses recalled seeing a girl in a polka-dot dress who  cried out "We shot him." Conspiracy advocates were also critical of the trial  lawyers who failed to move the jury, the psychiatrists for their conflicting  conclusions, and the Los Angeles Police for not pursuing possible links between  Sirhan and organized crime, Sirhan and the right-wing, Sirhan and the left-wing,  and Sirhan and the terrorist organization, Al Fatah. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Robert Blair Kaiser, the author of the first book to  proclaim conspiracy, advanced two possibilities. The first, initially proposed  by novelist Truman Capote, posited Sirhan had been an unwitting co-conspirator,  hypnotized by others, like Richard Condon's <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100103081231/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568582706/ref=ase_crimemagazine">Manchurian Candidate</a></i>. There  was no hard evidence to support this theory. The second was that Sirhan, with  his study of the occult, managed to hypnotize himself into killing Kennedy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Several legislative and judicial panels from the early  70's to the mid-80's found serious problems with the original investigation. It<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>had been carried out by the SUS (Special Unit Senator), a Los Angeles Police  team of detectives and aided by FBI investigators, but not all leads were  followed, not all avenues pursued. Critics presented witnesses who had allegedly  observed a second gunman, and they pointed to anomalies in the ballistics  evidence. The critics sufficiently established doubt about Sirhan's guilt and a  growing legion of supporters, including RFK aides, joined in the chorus of  disapproval at the way the case had been investigated. The LAPD and district  attorney's office attempted to frustrate these challenges to the official  version of the shooting by secrecy restrictions, bureaucratic maneuvers, silence  and counterattack. The way the LAPD acted did nothing but fuel a sense of  injustice that in turn eroded public trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">There were definite disconcerting inconsistencies in  testimony and evidence. A 1975 judicially appointed panel found bullet markings  that were different from the markings on Sirhan's gun. Dr. Thomas Noguchi, the  Los Angeles coroner who autopsied Kennedy's body, concluded with certainty that  Kennedy's mortal wound in the head was made by a shot which came from behind the  senator at a point only a few inches away, point blank range. Yet witnesses said  that Sirhan had been in front of Kennedy and was not closer than a few feet.  These glaring inconsistencies led many to believe there had been a second gunman  positioned behind Kennedy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The principal discrepancy in the investigation turned on  the number of shots fired. Sirhan's .22 caliber revolver held eight bullets and  all of these were discharged in a few moments of pandemonium. Three hit Kennedy,  one fatally. The remainder struck other members of the entourage, and a couple  of shots hit the ceiling, one lost in the ceiling interspace. But the  photographs of the crime scene, and the recollections of some of the police  officers involved in the investigation purportedly identified two more bullets  lodged in the wooden frame of the pantry's swinging doors. And if there were two  more bullets than Sirhan's pistol could possibly have fired, then another gun  must have been involved â€“ and another killer. Critics questioned why the  doorframes and other physical evidence had been destroyed by the LAPD.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1995 investigative reporter Dan Moldea, a former  conspiracy advocate, published the results of his investigation into the murder  of Robert Kennedy in <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100103081231/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393037916/ref=ase_crimemagazine">The Killing Of Robert Kennedy â€“ An Investigation into  Motive, Means and Opportunity</a></i> (1995). Moldea pored over the mountain of  evidence in the case. He studied the forensic and ballistic reports and  interviewed scores of witnesses, including many of the police officers involved  who had never been interviewed previously. What he found suggested a botched  investigation involving the mishandling of physical evidence in the case, the  failure to correctly interview some witnesses, the premature (but non-sinister)  destruction of key pieces of physical evidence, and the lack of proper  procedures in securing and investigating the crime scene. Moldea successfully  addressed the issues of alleged bullet holes in doorframes (too small to be made  by bullets) and the number of shots fired (eight, not 10 as conspiracy advocates  allege).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Moldea also discovered why official re-investigations of  the assassination in the 1970s were unable to positively match bullets from  Sirhan's gun with test-fired bullets. Sirhan's gun had been damaged by "heavy  leading" (barrel fouling) that compromised further tests carried out by  California authorities. Although the state's ballistics panel had guessed that  the reason they could not positively match the victim's bullets was because the  gun had been repeatedly fired, it was Moldea who settled the issue by  interviewing police officers who confirmed a number of firings had indeed taken  place. The heavy leading, Moldea discovered, was caused by numerous test firings  of Sirhan's gun by Los Angeles Police Officers who were, in effect, souvenir  hunters. "Thus, (LAPD ballistics expert DeWayne) Wolfer and only Wolfer could  have positively matched the three victim bullets," wrote Moldea, "before the  leading of and permanent damage to the barrel of Sirhan's gun. Wolfer  legitimately made these matches and testified honestly. His analysis could not  be confirmed by the firearms panel or anyone else, because the barrel became  damaged immediately after he conducted the tests."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">For decades conspiracy theorists had posited the idea that  a girl wearing a polka-dot dress had accompanied Sirhan in the hotel, and she  may have been Sirhan's "controller" or co-conspirator. The allegations arose  from statements made by a Kennedy campaign supporter, Sandra Serrano, who had  purportedly been sitting on an external staircase outside the Ambassador Embassy  Room. Pantry eyewitness Vincent DiPierro also supported the story of a polka-dot  girl. DiPierro, the son of the Ambassador's maitre d'hotel, said he saw a  "pretty girl" standing next to Sirhan seconds before the shooting. She was  "wearing a polka dot dress." DiPierro, however, later identified the girl as  Valerie Schulte. Schulte had been wearing a bright green dress with yellow  polka-dots, was pretty and blonde and, as DiPierro stated, had a "pug-nose."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although the LAPD maintained Serrano retracted her story  under intense questioning, conspiracy theorists said she had been bullied into  saying her story was false. Serrano had been given a polygraph test by Sgt.  Hernandez on June 20, 1968. Asked if she sat down on the stairway at the time of  the shooting she replied, "Yeah, I think I didâ€¦people messed me upâ€¦stupid  peopleâ€¦just in all the commotion and everythingâ€¦I was supposed to know more than  I knewâ€¦I told (DA staffer John Ambrose) I heard the people say "We shot him" or  "They shot him" or something. And I remember telling him that I had seen these  people on the â€¦on the stairway." According to the LAPD Summary Report,  "Polygraph examination disclosed that Serrano has never seen Sirhan in person;  further, that Miss Serrano fabricated, for some unknown reason, the story about  the girl in the polka dot dress. Responses to relevant questions indicate that  no one made statements to Miss Serrano telling her that they had shot Kennedy or  that she heard any gunshots during the late evening of June 4 or early morning  of June 5, 1968. Miss Serrano was informed of the results of the polygraph  examination."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Serrano eventually admitted that her story was founded on  a lot of guesswork for "â€¦two reasons, so I didn't look like a fool, which I look  like now. Another reason, because everybody figuresâ€¦you knowâ€¦I was sitting there  (in the police station) hearing descriptions and descriptions of these people.  Oh God, no, maybe that's what I'm supposed to seeâ€¦more than I did. It messed me  up, that's all, and I figured, well, they must know what they're doing â€“ I mean,  they are police, after all. They have to know what they're doing." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Additional proof that Serrano may have been lying was  provided by a Fire Inspector who swore Serrano was not on the outside stairs at  the Ambassador at the time she stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another woman came forward to provide some answers to the  polka-dot girl story that was causing alarm in news stories of the time.  Twenty-three-year-old Kathy Fulmer, who fit Serrano's description, said she had  been wearing a green suit and polka-dot scarf at the victory celebration. She  also ran from the hotel shouting, "He's been shot."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">And, as Moldea pointed out, there had been considerable  opportunity that night at the Ambassador for alcohol to fuel outbursts from  young conservatives when they discovered their liberal enemy had been taken out  of the presidential sweepstakes. During the evening friction had been developing  between the thousands of liberal supporters of RFK and Sen. Alan Cranston and  that of right-wing Sen. Max Rafferty supporters. An FBI report reveals how, on  the night of the shooting, a group of young people had been handing out bumper  stickers in the hotel lobby. They were reddish orange in color with black  lettering. According to Ambassador Hotel Security Chief William F. Gardner, the  leaflets referred to JFK's death. New York reporter Jimmy Breslin believes the  sticker said, "Expose The Kennedy Death Hoax."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Moldea believes this report is crucial as it shows how  anti-Kennedy activists were at the Ambassador that night and may have been the  source of the gleeful cries that Serrano said she heard. Serrano may also have  been witness to an innocent cry of "We (i.e., the American People) shot  Kennedy"; a natural response that reflected the intense concern Americans had at  that time to the growing senseless violence that had occurred in previous years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Earlier efforts to clear up the RFK mysteries pointed to  Thane Eugene Cesar as a second gunman. He was a part-time security guard who  carried the only other known pistol in the pantry that night. But he was never a  serious suspect. Moldea tracked him down and eventually persuaded him to take a  polygraph. (Moldea<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>said it exonerated him.) Moldea's research was truly a  tour de force clearing up the many inconsistencies in the evidence and providing  sufficient answers to establish what will likely be the best understanding of  what actually happened in the Ambassador kitchen pantry on the night of June 5,  1968. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Moldea also addressed the issue raised by conspiracy  advocates concerning the fatal wound Kennedy sustained in the back of his head.  When Moldea investigated the dynamics of the shooting he concluded that Kennedy  had been turning to his left when Sirhan fired the fatal shot. Furthermore, the  reliable witnesses to the shooting, Moldea pointed out, all said the distance  from Kennedy to Sirhan's gun was between 1 Â½ to 3 feet. Therefore it was not a  farfetched proposition to say that the muzzle of Sirhan's gun had or nearly  touched Kennedy's head in the chaos that ensued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">As Moldea explained, "All twelve of the eyewitness'  statements about muzzle distance is based on â€“ and only on â€“ their view of  Sirhan's first shot, (the shot which Moldea has argued, did not hit Kennedy in  the head). After the first shot, their eyes were diverted as panic swept through  the densely populated kitchen pantry. The 77 people in the area began to run,  duck for cover, and crash into each other."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">One of the most reliable witnesses, Lisa Urso, who was  able to see both Kennedy and Sirhan, saw Kennedy's hand move to his head behind  his right ear. As the distance from Kennedy to the gun after the first pop was  three feet it is likely he had been simply reacting defensively to the first  shot fired. Urso described Kennedy's movements as "â€¦(jerking) a little bit, like  backwards and then forwards". Moldea believes the backwards and forwards  jerking, "...came as Kennedy had recoiled after the first shot; he was then  accidentally bumped forward, toward the steam table and into Sirhan's gun where  he was hit at point blank range."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">There is additional evidence, related here for the first  time, that indicates Sirhan's gun eventually became positioned next to Kennedy's  head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">According to Boris Yaro, a photographer for <i>The Los  Angeles Times</i>, "Kennedy backed up against the kitchen freezers as the  gunman fired at him POINT BLANK RANGE (emphasis added)." This positioning of  Sirhan's gun is also supported by key witness Frank Burns, who was identified as  one of the five in the group (the others were Karl Uecker, Juan Romero, Jesus  Perez, Martin Patrusky) who were closest to the senator. Although Burns stated  the gun was never less than a foot or a foot and a half from Kennedy, he  nevertheless described the dynamics of the shooting in such a way to make it  entirely feasible that Sirhan's gun moved to an area inches away from Kennedy.  Burns had suffered an abrasion on his face that he thought was caused by a  bullet passing near his cheek. It was likely a powder burn from Sirhan's pistol.  Burns said: "â€¦I had just caught up with him (in the pantry), and he was a step  or so past him. And I'd turned around facing the same way as he turned toward  the busboys, I was just off his right shoulder, a matter of inches behind him." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">After Sirhan fired his gun Burns said, "The noise was like  a string of firecrackers going off, it wasn't in an even cadence. In the  process, a bullet must have passed very close to my left cheek because I can  remember the heat and a sort of burn. I remember an arm coming towards us,  through the people, with a gun in it. I was putting together the burn across my  cheek, the noise and the gun and I was thinking, 'My God, it's an assassination  attempt.' I turned my head and saw the gun and quickly looked back to the  senator and realized he'd been shot because he'd thrown his hands up toward his  head as if he was about to grab it at the line of his ears. He hadn't quite done  it. His arms were near his head and he was twisting to his left and falling  back. And then I looked back at the gunman, and at that moment he was almost  directly in front of me. He was still holding the gun and coming closer to the  senator, PURSUING THE BODY SO THAT THE ARC OF THE GUN WAS COMING DOWN TO THE  FLOOR AS THE BODY WAS GOING DOWN." (Emphasis added)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">To the national media, Moldea's<i> The Killing Of  Robert Kennedy</i> soon became the definitive book on the subject, answering the  many questions and mysteries that had plagued government investigations and  private researchers for the past three decades. But Moldea's book failed to  satisfy the self-styled critics. At various Internet sites, writers and  researchers criticized his work, pointing out supposed flaws in his research.  RFK researcher and author Philip Melanson rightly criticized Moldea for not  competently inquiring into the allegations that Sirhan had been hypnotically  manipulated. Sirhan's attorney, Larry Teeter, a committed JFK conspiracy  advocate, and Sirhan family friend Lynn Mangan, both of whom have been  attempting to secure a new trial for the convicted assassin, also met Moldea's  conclusions with ridicule. In addition, Sirhan retracted his many statements  admitting guilt, said he did not kill Kennedy, and that he had been "hypno-programmed"  by conspirators. According to Teeter the RFK assassination was a "sequel" to the  JFK murder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">But it was the publication of four books that decisively  placed the assassination back on the agenda of unsolved crimes: Philip Melanson  and William Klaber's <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100103081231/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312966075/ref=ase_crimemagazine">Shadow Play - The Untold Story of the Robert F  Kennedy Assassination</a></i> (1997); James DiEugenio and Lisa Pease's <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100103081231/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0922915822/ref=ase_crimemagazine">The  Assassinations - Probe magazine on JFK, MLK, RFK and Malcolm X</a></i> (2003);  ex-FBI agent William Turner's <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100103081231/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883955211/ref=ase_crimemagazine">Rearview Mirror- Looking Back At The FBI, The  CIA and Other Tails</a></i> (2001); and Peter Evans's <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100103081231/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060580534/ref=ase_crimemagazine">Nemesis</a></i> (2004).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Despite the notoriety of these four books, the conspiracy  advocates' claims to overturn Moldea's conclusions about the guilt of Sirhan  remain speculative at best. Moldea's research about the ballistics evidence and  his conclusions that no second gunman participated in the assassination have  never been challenged successfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Amongst conspiracy advocates, only Peter Evans supported  the argument that Sirhan actually fired the gun that killed Kennedy. Yet his  allegations that Aristotle Onassis ordered the assassination are flawed. Evans  alleged that Sirhan had been ordered to kill RFK by PLO official Mahmoud  Hamshari. Evans claims to have unearthed evidence that Onassis had given  Hamshari money to direct his PLO terrorists away from his Olympic Airways  airlines at a time when planes were being hijacked and that some of the money  was used to hire Sirhan to kill RFK. Evans claimed that Onassis was aware of the  plot and, indeed, wanted RFK eliminated so Kennedy would not stand in the way of  Onassis marrying JFK's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy. While Evans supports the  hypnotized-assassin theory, he provides no evidence that Hamshari, who was  assassinated by Israeli Intelligence agents in 1973, gave the murder contract to  Sirhan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In fact there are a number of inconsistencies in Evans's  theory. Although the author accepts the statements made by Onassis's<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span> friends and relatives that the shipping tycoon admitted he had been responsible  for RFK's murder, he contradicts himself by quoting close Onassis aides as  having had trouble sorting out their boss's "exaggerations, half-truths and  lies." Evans is also unable to establish whether or not Robert Kennedy had had  an affair with his brother's widow. Throughout the book he accepts this as a  given but he told news reporters that it was only "entirely possible." In fact,  there is no credible evidence to support the allegation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Central to Evans's thesis are entries in Sirhan's  notebooks that purportedly connect Onassis to the assassin. Evans alleges  Sirhan's notebooks make reference to Onassis's son Alexander's girlfriend,  Fiona, whom Onassis detested, as well as to Stavros Niarchos, Onassis's shipping  rival. Evans wrote: "On the first page, Sirhan had written at the center of a  roundel, amid Arabic writing, the single name, FIONA. And on another page: 2  NIARCHOS! On a third page, between the lines 'One hundred thousand dollars and  Dollars â€“ One Hundreds,' Sirhan had written in Arabic: 'They should be killed'.  And next to that, the number: THREEâ€¦Fiona, Niarchos and Kennedy: The names were  startling by virtue of their very juxtaposition. But, as a lawyer, Yannis  Georgakis (Onassis aide) was always skeptical: He did not trust facts that were  startling, and circumstantial evidence made him uncomfortable. But three names  and a sum of money written in a killer's notebook (Sirhan's references to  $100,000 in his notebooks) â€“ he had seen far flimsier evidence than that get a  conviction in a court of law." Evans was thus positing the idea that because  Sirhan had made references to three names connected to Onassis â€“ Fiona, Niarchos  and Robert Kennedy â€“ together with Sirhan's references to a large sum of money â€“  the shipping tycoon must have been connected to the assassination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Evans's juxtaposition of names is misleading. Sirhan had  placed the name FIONA in a list of racehorse names â€“ Fiona, Jet-Spec, Kings  Abbey, and Prince Khaled. The Arabic script consists of one sentence "He should  be killed" (not "They should be killed") and does not refer to either Stavros  Niarchos or Fiona. The diary entry "Niarkos" remains unexplained, as do many  other entries in Sirhan's notebooks, but there is no indication it refers to  anyone on a Sirhan death list. The words in Sirhan's notebooks were the result  of simple stream-of-consciousness ramblings he learned from Rosicrucian  literature as ways to improve his life. The notebooks are filled with names of  people Sirhan knew â€“ Bert Altfillisch, Peggy Osterkamp, and Gwen Gumm for  example, and people he didn't know such as Garner Ted Armstrong. The entries  that refer to "One Hundred Thousand Dollars" most probably reflect Sirhan's  obsessions with wealth and appear a number of times in the notebooks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The original police and FBI investigators could find no  connection between Sirhan and any PLO contact. And Evans's allegations that the  PLO had been hijacking airplanes prior to Kennedy's assassination are spurious.  The PLO did not begin to use the terrorist tactic of hijacking airplanes until  July of 1968, one month after RFK's murder. There is also no evidence that  Sirhan had been paid to carry out the murder and no money transaction has  surfaced that would indicate that Sirhan or his brothers received large sums of  money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Also central to Evans's thesis was the implication that  Sirhan had spent a three-month period before the assassination being trained by  terrorists or undergoing hypnotic indoctrination. Evans was wrong in stating  Sirhan's movements were unaccounted for, or "a blanket of white fog" as he put  it. Evans quotes L.A. Police Officer Sgt. William Jordan, who told him that the  special investigative team he worked on immediately after Kennedy's  assassination could not account for Sirhan's movements in a three-month period  in the year before the assassination. The LAPD investigative team gave no  credence to the idea that Sirhan had been missing during any period from June  1967 to June 1968, despite the comments of Jordan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the year prior to the assassination, waitress Marilyn  Hunt had seen Sirhan frequently in Pasadena's Hi-Life Bar. He also was seen in  Shap's Bar during this time. In July 1967 Sirhan filed a disability complaint  for workmen's compensation. Between July and September 1967 Sirhan's mother and  brother Munir said Sirhan went often to the Pasadena library. Library records  confirm he borrowed books during this period. Sirhan's mother said her son  "...stayed at home for over a year (sic) with no job"(October 1966 to September  1967). Also during this period Sirhan, by his mother's account, often drove her  to work. On Sept. 9, 1967 Sirhan began work at John Weidner's health-food store.  Weidner reported no long periods of absence up to the time Sirhan left his  employ in March 1968. So how did Sirhan "emerge(ed) from this 'white fog" in  March 1968, (and) joined the (Rosicrucians)" as Evans states? (Author's note:  Sirhan actually joined the Rosicrucians in June 1966.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sirhan's movements in the three months prior to the  assassination leave no unaccountable period when he could have been  indoctrinated. On March 7 Sirhan left his job at a Pasadena health food store.  Following Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination he discussed that murder with  Alvin Clark, a Pasadena garbage collector. This would have to be after April 4,  1968 â€“ which leaves only eight weeks unaccounted for before Kennedy was  murdered. Even during most of that period Sirhan was reported to be in Pasadena.  Sirhan's friend, Walter Crowe, said he met Sirhan in Pasadena on the night of  May 2, 1968 when they discussed politics. The last time he saw Sirhan was on the  Pasadena college campus on May 23, 1968. Crowe said he was in Denny's restaurant  when Sirhan entered with a group of friends. This leaves only a two-week period  not accounted for. But Sirhan refers to local newspaper and local radio reports  throughout the month of May. Besides, Sirhan was living at 696 E. Howard Street,  Pasadena. Family and friends have never suggested he was missing during this  period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Evans's scenario is fundamentally implausible. How could  plotters, for example, be sure that Sirhan, after his arrest, would not suddenly  remember his contacts, turn state's evidence, and be kept in a safe house by the  district attorney? If the plotters believed Sirhan would be killed by Kennedy's  security, it had to have been the least thought-out plot conceivable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Furthermore, had Sirhan suddenly "remembered" he would not  have thrown away the chance to save his own life by failing to inform investigators  of his involvement with Hamshari. His lawyers could also have built a strong case  around the paid-assassin theory, arguing against the imposition of  the death penalty that was eventually handed down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Intriguing as Evans's thesis is, there is no credible  evidence that Sirhan had been directed to kill Kennedy by the PLO â€“ apart from  hearsay and second-hand accounts by a number of individuals who were close to  Onassis. The record indicates that Sirhan was indeed motivated by political  considerations but he was an "unaffiliated terrorist" rather than someone who  had plotted with a terrorist group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although Moldea had successfully addressed the issue of  Sirhan's guilt in shooting Kennedy, the issue of motive and the suspicions that  Sirhan had been hypnotized remained problematic. Moldea believed Sirhan had been  acting out his crime for personal reasons, that the assassin's claims to have  acted in response to America's policy on the Middle East was merely an excuse.  Conspiracy writers maintained that Sirhan had no motive at all as they believed  he did not kill Kennedy or if he fired shots he had acted as a patsy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Conspiracy advocates point to Sirhan's staring at a  Teletype machine as evidence that he had been hypnotised. Yet, things around him  frequently entranced Sirhan. This was part of his make-up. Sirhan told his  police interrogators, "â€¦everythingâ€¦life itself is a challengeâ€¦when you watch a  barber, sir, I just stand and watch that barber for hours. Iâ€¦from the time I'm  watching him I want to be nothing but a barber. You know, if I'm watching a  dentist, boy, he fascinates me, and I want to be him. I was talking to (LAPD  Officer) Frank here a while ago. The way he talked, you knowâ€¦I was very  fascinated and, you know, I was sort of superimposing myself in his position  forâ€¦temporarily." In fact, this would not be the first time Sirhan had  experienced trance-like states. He experienced them as a boy growing up in  Jerusalem, according to his mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">A majority of hypnosis and mind-control experts within the  scientific community dismiss the notion that subjects can be hypnotised to  commit murder. They maintain that such a possibility of programming an unwitting  and unwilling subject is not possible. Hypnosis expert Dr. Eyzel Cardena of the  Society For Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis told this writer, "Most experts  in hypnosis opine that the scenario you describe (i.e., a  hypnotically-programmed Sirhan) is implausible." UK hypnosis expert Dr. Graham  Wagstaff of the University of Liverpool believes that, "â€¦Controlled empirical  research seems fairly overwhelming to support the view that hypnosis does not  have some special coercive power over and above a comparable situation in which  people feel motivated or pressured to perform anti-social actionsâ€¦"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Furthermore, there would be no guarantee of success for a  robotic assassin; it is an erratic tool. A hypnotist can plant a suggestion in  the subject's mind and ask him to forget that suggestion but there is no  foolproof way of preventing another hypnotist coming along and recovering that  memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Evans and other conspiracy advocates go to great lengths  to imply that Sirhan was likely hypnotised to kill RFK. They have given credence  to the claim made by hypnotist expert William Bryan that he had been Sirhan's  controller. Bryan was famous for having hypnotised the Boston Strangler, Albert  DeSalvo. Bryan also claimed he had worked for the CIA and, according to Jonn  Christian, bragged to two prostitutes he had hypnotised Sirhan to kill Kennedy.  Bryan's credibility was damaged, however, when it was discovered that the  California Board of Medical Examiners had, in 1969, found him guilty of sexually  molesting women patients he had hypnotised. And, shortly before his death in Las  Vegas in 1976, Bryan told Hollywood reporter Greg Roberts the Sirhan story was  not true. Furthermore, there is no credible evidence whatsoever to support  Bryan's earlier reported claims he was Sirhan's controller or the claims of one  of Evans's "unnamed" sources that Bryan had worked for the CIA's hypnosis expert  Sidney Gottlieb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Evans quotes from John Marks's book <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100103081231/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393307948/ref=ase_crimemagazine">The Search For The  Manchurian Candidate</a></i> and cites the experiments conducted by Morse Allen, the  CIA scientist that conspiracy advocates allege was successful in programming an  assassin. Allen hypnotised his secretary, who had a fear and loathing of guns,  to pick up a pistol and shoot another secretary. The gun, of course, was  unloaded. After Allen brought the secretary out of the trance she allegedly had no memory of what she had done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">While conspiracy advocates promote this episode as proof  of the CIA successfully developing programmed assassins, they fail to mention  that Allen did not give much credibility to his own experiment. Allen believed  that all that happened was that an impressionable young woman volunteer had  accepted orders from a legitimate authority figure to carry out an order she  likely knew would not end in tragedy. Allen also believed there were too many  variables in hypnosis for it to be a reliable weapon. And all the participants  in such trials knew they were involved in a scientific experiment. There was  always an authority figure present to remind the subject or some part of the  subject's mind that it was only an experiment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">There is also evidence that Sirhan had known of how  "diminished capacity" can be used to excuse acts of murder. Following his arrest  Sirhan had asked Officer Frank about the Boston Strangler case and how Albert  DeSalvo had committed the crimes because he had suffered a deprived childhood.  Sirhan responded, "â€¦but, correct me if I'm mistaken, is it whenâ€¦the man is  self-admitting? He admits that he's, wasn't trying, but they won't believe him?  Is this related to it?" Robert Blair Kaiser, who came to know Sirhan better than  any of the defense lawyers, believed Sirhan knew that the Boston Strangler  committed his crimes in a disassociated state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Additionally, there is evidence, not presented at the  trial, which proves that Sirhan had been feigning amnesia. Sirhan has always  proclaimed that he could not remember writing in his notebooks, "RFK must die,"  nor could he remember shooting Kennedy. To disprove this, the prosecutors at  Sirhan's trial brought in a handwriting expert who disputed the notion that  Sirhan's notebook entries were written in a trance. The FBI concluded that  Sirhan had written the entries "haphazardly, jumping around the pages in the  notebook," and were not written under the influence of a hypnotic trance. It was  also clear to ACLU lawyer Abraham Lincoln Wirin that Sirhan had remembered his  notebooks contained incriminating evidence. Sirhan had asked Wirin to tell his  mother to clean up his room. Wirin believed it was requested in the hope that  his mother would see the notebook entries and destroy them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">There is also compelling evidence that from the start  Sirhan had realized what he had done. He confessed to ACLU lawyer Wirin that he  "â€¦did it, I shot him." He also told defense investigator Michael McCowan that he  remembered shooting Kennedy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">McCowan was a private detective who assisted Sirhan  lawyers. In the pre-trial period, McCowan had been talking to Sirhan about the  shooting. McCowan had been startled when Sirhan related to him how his eyes had  met Kennedy's in the moment just before he shot him. McCowan asked Sirhan, "Then  why, Sirhan, didn't you shoot him between the eyes?" Without hesitating, Sirhan  replied, "Because that son-of-a-bitch turned his head at the last second."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">McCowan's story is also supported by another telling  incident that was reported in Robert Kaiser's book, <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100103081231/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006CF4GC/ref=ase_crimemagazine">RFK Must Die</a></i> published in 1970. During Sirhan's trial, hotel workers Jesus Perez and Martin  Patrusky both said Sirhan had approached them to ask if Kennedy would be coming  through the pantry following his speech. Sirhan had contended he did not  remember anything after he had collected his gun from his car. Yet, following  the testimonies of the hotel workers, Sirhan had told McCowan, who was seated  next to him, that he had not approached either witness. When McCowan reminded  Sirhan that he supposedly remembered nothing of this period before the crime,  Sirhan "â€¦nodded and gulped."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">There is also supportive evidence showing that Sirhan had  lied about his memory loss. In a conversation with defense investigator and  author Robert Blair Kaiser, Sirhan had been telling him how he thought Lee  Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray had acted as cowards in shooting their victims  from behind. Kaiser asked Sirhan if his act was less cowardly. Sirhan responded,  "Hey, when you shoot a man in the back? There you go! At least Kennedy saw me."  Sirhan quickly and disingenuously added, "I think, I don't know." At the trial  Sirhan's lawyer, Grant Cooper asked the accused assassin, "It appears in your  notebook what might appear to be goals (RFK Must Die), did you have them in mind  when you wrote them down?" Sirhan replied, "Yes, sir, I did in reference to the  assassination of Robert Kennedyâ€¦(only) for the time it was writtenâ€¦"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">If Sirhan had been lying then how was the hypnotic defense  and Sirhan's amnesia defense constructed in the first place? Sirhan claimed his  lawyers had first put forward the idea that he had been in a hypnotic  trance-like state when he shot Kennedy. But there is evidence that Sirhan had  foreknowledge of amnesiac states before he committed the murder and is presented  here for the first time in this article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sirhan had read Truman Capote's <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100103081231/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679745580/ref=ase_crimemagazine">In Cold Blood</a></i>, a  book about the multiple murders of a Kansas farmer, his wife, and two teenage  children. Perry Smith and Richard Hickock committed the murders in 1959 and  Capote's book of the murder, manhunt, trial and executions of the murderers was  published in 1965. Sirhan identified with the short and stocky Smith, feeling  great empathy for him. Smith had suffered a deprived childhood, had bouts of  shivering and trance-like states, and believed in mysticism and fate. According  to Capote, Smith, "...had many methods of passing (time)...among them, MIRROR  GAZINGâ€¦EVERY TIME (HE SAW) A MIRROR (HE WOULD) GO INTO A TRANCE (emphasis  added)." At the conclusion of the book Capote quoted the opinions of leading  psychiatrists Drs. Joseph Satten, Karl Menninger, Irwin Rosen, and Martin Mayman,  about why people like Smith and Hickock committed such crimes and what their  mental states were like during the commission of the murders. The psychiatrists  attempted to assess the criminal responsibility of a number of murderers:  "â€¦murderers who seem rational, coherent and controlled and yet whose homicidal  acts have a bizarre, apparently senseless qualitiesâ€¦"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In their examinations the psychiatrists found a number of  similarities, including the fact that the men who they studied, "â€¦were puzzled  as to why they killed their victims, who were relatively unknown to them, and in  each instance the murderer appears to have lapsed into a DREAMLIKE  DISASSOCIATIVE TRANCE (emphasis added) from which he awakened to suddenly  discover himself assaulting the victimâ€¦Two of the men reported severe  dissassociative trancelike states during which violent and bizarre behavior was  seen, while the other two reported less severe and perhaps less well-organised,  AMNESIAC EPISODES (emphasis added)â€¦..". It is therefore likely Sirhan had used  his knowledge of how murderers behave to construct a possible  diminished-capacity defense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sirhan may have been mentally unstable and angry at a  society that had relegated him to the bottom of the heap, as Dan Moldea  concludes. But there is sufficient evidence, originating years before the  shooting, that Sirhan clearly saw himself, like today's suicide bombers, as an  Arab hero. The PLO and most Palestinians certainly judged him this way. And  Sirhan's lack of remorse is entirely in keeping with the terrorist way of  rationalizing political murder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sirhan and his brothers could not, or would not,  assimilate into American society. They abhorred U.S. culture, disliked the mores  of the American people, and, most importantly, hated the support Americans gave  to the state of Israel. The family felt they were part of a minority group  alienated and misunderstood within the larger community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sirhan told Robert Kaiser of how Arabs were treated like  second-class citizens in the United States, "Just because we're Arabs in this  country," he said, "we have no power, no prestige, no influence, no money â€“  nothing really. We can be treated like dogs, like ants. Had it not been for meâ€¦Munir  would be out there in one of those (Palestinian refugee) camps. He would have  been deported (for having a criminal conviction)â€¦The whole world knows Sirhan  now. If they had deported his younger brother from America that would show an  injustice on the part of Americaâ€¦But even without me, what's all the difference?  Munir was just a good-for-nothing Aye-rab."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Would Sirhan have killed Robert Kennedy had there been  peace between Arabs and Jews? It is possible. Sirhan fit the profile of an  assassin bent on striking out at a country he felt had betrayed him. He was a  disillusioned man who wanted to attain fame in the classical tradition of  American assassins. On the other hand, it was Sirhan's political motives that  gave him pride, self-esteem, but also a deep-rooted anger. These were the  sentiments that spurred him to act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">As most Americans were unaware of the Palestinian issue,  very few journalists examined Sirhan's background as a Palestinian Arab in an  attempt to explain the tragedy. Instead, commentators wrote Sirhan off as yet  another misfit with a gun who stalks and then murders a leading public official  with no apparent motive except his own demons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In time, Sirhan defenders found it difficult to accept  that this was a murder that had its roots in a political motive. In fact, it  was necessary to disprove a political motive if their thesis of a controlled  assassin was to have any credibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sirhan's self-confessed motive was entirely consistent  throughout the weeks, months and years following his act. Immediately following  the shooting he cried out that he did it for his "country." When asked by a  police sergeant if he was ashamed of what he did he replied, "Hell, no!" In  fact, he was so proud of his act that the morning following the shooting he  asked jail guards for a newspaper so he could see what had been written about  him. When no news stories of the assassination appeared due to press deadlines,  he became upset. His insistence that his crime was political was followed up  with repeated protestations that no other motive existed except a love for his  people. "June 5th stood out for meâ€¦more than my own birth date! I felt Robert  Kennedy was coinciding his own appeal for votes with the anniversary of the (Six  Day) war," Sirhan said. From numerous statements, he made to his lawyers and  family it is clear he believed he had been adventurous, daring and brave â€“ the  qualities Arabs most admire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the hours and days following the shooting, he must have  realized the shame he had brought upon his mother. How then could he accept  guilt as a political assassin and at the same time escape culpability? The  answer was to feign amnesia, while at the same time maintaining that he "must  have shot Kennedy." It held out some hope that his conviction might someday be  overturned, but it also guaranteed him praise from his fellow Arabs and  Palestinians. For Sirhan, this was the best of both worlds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sirhan was an immigrant in America who did not have full  citizenship. He had been constantly seeking identity â€“ a means to give some  meaning to a life that was increasingly losing hope. Because Sirhan identified  with the Palestinian cause, anything that humiliated Arabs was a personal insult  to him and damaged his self-esteem. His sense of self began to rest on his  identity as a Palestinian Arab. And he supported the Arab cause, believing he  was tied to it by his bloodline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The late Edward Said, one of the leading Palestinian  intellectuals for the past 30 years, viewed the Palestinian/Arab cause as  Sirhan's rationale for the assassination. As a poor working class immigrant,  Sirhan identified with his downtrodden people living as refugees in Jordan,  Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon. The period 1967-68, the year following the Six Day  War, became a crucial time in Sirhan's life; it was the time when Israel became  dominant in the region after successfully defending itself against Arab  aggression. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Having failed to eject the Jews from Israel/Palestine,  Arabs throughout the world felt powerless and weak and Arab pride had been  severely damaged. Their condition exaggerated Sirhan's feelings of inadequacy  even though he lived thousands of miles away from the conflict. Many exiled  Palestinians sought retribution and began to formulate plans to kill innocent  civilians and hi-jack planes. Sirhan's answer to these problems took the form of  killing a major American politician who advocated support for Israel. Sirhan  said, "â€¦this momentum just took hold of me and by June 5th 1968 (The  first anniversary of the Six Day War) I couldn't control it anymore." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In fact, Sirhan could have targeted any of the leading  presidential candidates that year to publicize, through a violent act, the cause  of the Palestinians. Hubert Humphrey, Eugene McCarthy, Richard Nixon, and Nelson  Rockefeller all supported military aid to Israel and believed in the continuing  American/Israeli alliance. So why did Sirhan choose RFK?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Initially, Sirhan would likely have been satisfied with  any opportunity to kill a leading American politician. At one point, he even had  UN Ambassador Goldberg in his sights. Sirhan said he first considered killing  Vice President Humphrey, "It might not even have been just Kennedy," Sirhan told  Robert Kaiser, " â€¦ Somebody who was big, tough, somebody who was â€“ it wasn't  necessarily Kennedy â€“ it could have been somebody else but someone who would  still represent American policy that was pro-Israel. In fact, it â€“ for example â€“  might have been Humphrey. Because Humphrey was a person you didn't particularly  like either."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, in the years between 1963 and 1968, American  political culture had been dominated by the idea of a Kennedy Dynasty and myths  surrounding JFK's assassination. Year after year books, movies, television  documentaries, and political news stories gave a cult-like status to JFK's  assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. Sirhan, too, desired fame. Killing any of the other  candidates would certainly have given him status throughout the Arab world. But  his true target had an even greater symbolism attached to it. Sirhan would  become the "Second Kennedy Assassin." He knew that killing RFK would give him  greater world exposure the other candidates could not provide. It was no  accident that Sirhan set his sights on the candidate who was the brother of the  martyred president. It was no accident that Sirhan chose the candidate who was  most likely to become the next president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">One of Sirhan's doctors, Dr. Martin Schorr, who examined  Sirhan in the pre-trial period, said the assassin was, "â€¦not a raving maniac.  He's got a keen sense of justice, but it is from his private world." However,  this sense of justice that Schorr spoke of was not from Sirhan's private or  fantasy world. Schorr, along with the majority of the American people, had not  yet understood the logic of terrorist acts. Not only was Sirhan's act logical  but also it was embraced, condoned, and applauded throughout the Arab world. As  Sirhan said, "(My act) was a warning to the U.S. You'd better listen and be more  cautious. Be more fair. Remember Kennedy. Remember Kennedy." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">To the Western mind terrorists are deranged and evil even  though their acts are not the product of insanity but possess a logic all their  own. Terrorists have rational, if sometimes bizarre, motives. It is also true  that many terrorists (like Al Qaeda's Ramzi Youssef) display symptoms of a  psychopathic nature â€“ they are cold blooded and carry out their acts of terror  without remorse. But their acts are not the products of delusional or irrational  minds. Nor was Sirhan's. He did indeed crave attention and success. He was  depressed that society had relegated him to the bottom of the heap. He felt an  allegiance and empathy with assassins of the past. And he dreamed of infamy. But  without his sense of "Arabness" and without the bitterness and hatred towards  Jews that had their roots in his childhood indoctrination, it is unlikely Sirhan  would have assassinated Robert Kennedy. All the hatred that spewed forth from  Sirhan's gun can ultimately be traced back to three sources â€“ Anti-Americanism,  Palestinian nationalism and anti-Semitism. Sirhan's assassination of Robert  Kennedy may have been the first act in an international political drama that  culminated in 9/11.</span></p>
