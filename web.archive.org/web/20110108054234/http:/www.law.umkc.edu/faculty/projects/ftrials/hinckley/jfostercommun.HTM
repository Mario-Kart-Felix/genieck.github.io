            <p><tt>Dear Jodie,</tt>
            </p>
            <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a definite
possibility that I
will be killed in my attempt to get Reagan.&nbsp; It is for this very
reason
that I am writing you this letter now.</tt>
            <br>
            <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you well know by now I love
you very
much.&nbsp; Over the past seven months I've left you dozens of poems,
letters
and love messages in the faint hope that you could develop an interest
in me.&nbsp; Although we talked on the phone a couple of times I never
had the nerve to simply approach you and introduce myself.&nbsp;
Besides
my shyness, I honestly did not wish to bother you with my constant
presence.&nbsp;
I know the many messages left at your door and in your mailbox were a
nuisance,
but I felt that it was the most painless way for me to express my love
for you.</tt>
            <br>
            <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel very good about the
fact that you
at least know my name and know how I feel about you.&nbsp; And by
hanging
around your dormitory, I've come to realize that I'm the topic of more
than a little conversation, however full of ridicule it may be.&nbsp;
At
least you know that I'll always love you.</tt>
            <br>
            <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jodie, I would abandon this
idea of getting
Reagan in a second if I could only win your heart and live out the rest
of my life with you, whether it be in total obscurity or whatever.&nbsp;</tt>
            <br>
            <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will admit to you that the
reason I'm
going ahead with this attempt now is because I just cannot wait any
longer
to impress you.&nbsp; I've got to do something now to make you
understand,
in no uncertain terms, that I am doing all of this for your sake!&nbsp;
By sacrificing my freedom and possibly my life, I hope to change your
mind
about me.&nbsp; This letter is being written only an hour before I
leave
for the Hilton Hotel.&nbsp; Jodie, I'm asking you to please look into
your
heart and at least give me the chance, with this historical deed, to
gain
your respect and love.</tt>
            </p>
            <p><tt>I love you forever,</tt>
            </p>
