When in doubt about appropriate behavior in our Interactive Areas, please remember that, although the venue is electronic, those participating in it are real people. We ask that you treat others with respect. Any conduct by a participant in the Interactive Areas that violates this Agreement in any way may result in the suspension or termination of the visitor’s registration and access to the Sites, at the Sites’ sole discretion, in addition to any other remedies. The Sites may provide interactive activities on a number of topics, but our staff or volunteer hosts participating in these activities do not offer professional advice of any kind and are speaking from their own experience or opinion as is helpful for the facilitation of the dialogue. These hosts claim no professional expertise or authority. We may also post additional guidelines and/or a code of conduct for certain Interactive Areas or events. Any additional posted rules will be incorporated into this Agreement. To the extent there is a conflict between the rules of a specific event and this Agreement, the rules of the specific event will govern.

          <h2>Copyright Infringement and Trademark Rights</h2>
          <p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others. Accordingly, we have a policy of removing User Submissions that violate copyright law, suspending access to the Services (or any portion thereof) to any user who uses the Services in violation of copyright law, and/or terminating in appropriate circumstances the account of any user who uses the Services in violation of copyright law. Pursuant to Title 17 of the United States Code, Section 512, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”), we have implemented procedures for receiving written notification of claimed copyright infringement and for processing such claims in accordance with such law. If you believe a user of the Services is infringing your copyright, please provide written notice to our agent listed below for notice of claims of copyright infringement.</p>

          <p>Your written notice must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>contain your physical or electronic signature;</li>
            <li>identify the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed;</li>
            <li>identify the allegedly infringing material in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material;</li>
            <li>contain adequate information by which we can contact you (including postal address, telephone number, and email address);</li>
            <li>contain a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or the law;</li>
            <li>contain a statement that the information in the written notice is accurate; and</li>
            <li>contain a statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please do not send notices or inquiries unrelated to alleged copyright infringement to our designated copyright agent.</p>

          <p>If you believe that your trademark is being used somewhere on the Services in a way that constitutes trademark infringement, the owner or an agent of the owner may notify us at <a href="mailto:legal@theringer.com">legal@theringer.com</a>. We ask that any complaints provide the accurate identity of the owner, how we may contact you, and the specific nature of the complaint.</p>
          <p>If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongfully filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see www.loc.gov/copyright. Send counter-notices to the same addresses listed above and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider’s address is located, or, if the content provider’s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</p>
          <p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company’s discretion.</p>
          <p>If the Sites receive more than one Notice of Copyright Infringement concerning a user, the user may be deemed a “repeat copyright infringer.” The Sites reserve the right to terminate the accounts of “repeat copyright infringers.”</p>

        </li>
        <li><h2 id="arbitration-agreement">Arbitration Agreement</h2>
            <p>Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Bill Simmons Media Group, and any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, brands and entities that it controls (collectively “we,” “us,” or “our”) and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. Both you and Bill Simmons Media Group acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Bill Simmons Media Group’s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.</p>

          <h3>Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</h3>
          <p>The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in Washington, DC, District of Columbia. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

          <h3>Costs of Arbitration</h3>
          <p>The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Bill Simmons Media Group will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. Bill Simmons Media Group will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>

          <h3>Small Claims Court; Infringement</h3>
          <p>Either you or Bill Simmons Media Group may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Washington, DC, District of Columbia or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</p>

          <h3>Waiver of Jury Trial</h3>
          <p>YOU AND Bill Simmons Media Group WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Bill Simmons Media Group are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Bill Simmons Media Group over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND Bill Simmons Media Group WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>

          <h3>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</h3>
          <p>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Bill Simmons Media Group is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.</p>

          <h3>Opt-out</h3>
          <p>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address:</p>
          <p>438 N Gower St, Los Angeles, CA 90028</p>
          <p>postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement. Notices sent to any other address, or sent by electronic mail or communicated orally, will not be accepted or effective.</p>

          <h3>Exclusive Venue</h3>
          <p>If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Bill Simmons Media Group to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Bill Simmons Media Group agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Washington, DC, District of Columbia, or the federal district in which that county falls.</p>

          <h3>Severability</h3>
          <p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Bill Simmons Media Group.</p>
