Collectively, in this document, we’ll refer to the suite of Digg products and services as “Digg”.</p>

<h6>Information Collected From Third Party Services:</h6>
<p>Some features of Digg allow you to share content accessed through Digg to Third Party Services, as well as your content through Third Party Services to Digg. If you choose to connect Digg to such Third Party Services, we may collect information related to your use of those Third Party Services, such as authentication tokens that allow us to connect to your Third Party Service accounts. We may otherwise collect information about how you are using Digg to interact with those connected Third Party Services. Note that Third Party Services may have the ability to restrict the information that is provided to us.</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics provides us with information such as how often people visit, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. To accomplish this, Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, but not your name or other identifying information. Google Analytics also places a permanent cookie on your web browser to define user sessions and recognize you as a return user the next time you visit this site.</p>
<p>We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Google Analytics uses only first-party cookies for data analysis, which means that the cookies are linked to a specific website domain, and Google Analytics will only use that cookie data for statistical analysis related to your browsing behavior on that website. The data collected cannot be retrieved by services from other domains.</p>
<p>Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html" target="_blank">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a> and the <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits by disabling cookies in your browser or deleting the Google Analytics cookies. You can also manage your settings for Google Analytics and opt-out of this feature by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google.com Ad Settings</a> or <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">Google Analytics' opt-out tools</a>.</p>
<p>Digg mobile applications (iOs and Android) use Localytics for demographic and interest-based information. You may wish to read <a href="http://www.localytics.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Localytics’ privacy policy</a> and/or use their <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank">opt-out service</a>.</p>
<p>Digg uses Chartbeat in order to measure engagement and help us make decisions about features or products we offer. If you would like to opt-out, you can delete some cookies from your browser as described in the <a href="https://chartbeat.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Charbeat Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Digg uses Quantcast for information on Internet traffic statistics and demographic data. If you do not wish to participate, you may adjust your setting in Quantcast’s <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/opt-out/" target="_blank">opt-out tool</a>.</p>
<p>You may also opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting by going to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>
<h6>IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:</h6>
<p>We automatically receive and record information from the Digg application or your web browser when you interact with Digg, including your IP address and cookie information. This information is used to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with Digg (e.g., what content you have clicked on).</p>
<p>Generally, Digg automatically collects usage information, such as the number and frequency of users accessing Digg, Digg features and applications, and its various streams of content. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of Digg so that we can analyze and improve them.</p>
<h6>Information Collected Using Cookies:</h6>
<p>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser or application when you access a website or service. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website or service you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser or Digg application and tell us how and when you visit and use Digg through the web or through an application. Digg may also use cookies to display the most appropriate advertisements, based on your interests and activity on our sites.</p>
<p>Digg cookies also allow us to track when you have accessed content through Digg. Each access is tracked using a unique identifier assigned to you in one or more cookies stored by your web browser or application and associated with Digg.</p>
<p>Digg cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser or application has accessed content through Digg and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer or device. For example, third party websites may set their own cookies.</p>
<h6>Pixel Tags</h6>
<p>We may also use "pixel tags," which are small graphic files that allow us and third parties to monitor the use of Digg and collect Usage Data. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time (and length of time) the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie previously placed by that server on your computer.</p>
<p>We may use pixel tags, either provided by us or by our third party advertisers, service providers and ad networks, to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with Digg and use them in combination with our cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you. Pixel tags may also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit Digg or other websites.</p>
<h6>Aggregate Information:</h6>
<p>We collect statistical information about how people use Digg ("Aggregate Information"). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information, such as your location (which, in turn, can be derived from your IP address or through location based services used by your device). This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account, your web browser or your Digg application.</p>
<h5>How and To Whom Is My Information Shared?</h5>
<p>Digg is designed to help you share information that you or people you choose to follow locate on the web. As a result, much of the information generated through Digg is shared publicly or with third parties. All Digg content is public. We may also distribute content and feeds through an email digest to users who have elected to receive such email digests.</p>
<h6>Public Digg Activity Information:</h6>
<p>Your activity on the Digg network is public by default and can be located by or distributed to anyone, although certain activity and information can be made private through your Account settings page (such as your Digg Deeper/Top Twitter stories, Digg Reader feed, items that you digg, and your Saved items). Individuals reading the aforementioned information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. Therefore, we urge you to think carefully about how you configure your Digg settings, and what actions you take on Digg.</p>
<h6>Information You Elect to Share:</h6>
<p>In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, you should also review the terms of service and privacy policies of any Third Party Services that you access through Digg. Digg respects the privacy settings/policies that you have selected with Third Party Services, and only shares information consistent with those privacy settings and policies.</p>
<p>You may otherwise access Third Party Services through Digg, for example by accessing curated content. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on or through Digg.</p>
<h6>User Profile Information:</h6>
<p>User profile information, including the display Name you select, the username you choose to use on Digg, avatars or images you elect to upload and other information you enter on your profile (such as your bio), may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within Digg. Email addresses, Twitter, Facebook, and/or Google account name will not appear on your public profile unless you enter it in the bio area yourself.</p>
<h6>Aggregate Information:</h6>
<p>We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use Digg and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how we interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.</p>
<h6>Information Shared with Our Agents:</h6>
<p>We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our "Agents"). We may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.</p>
<h6>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:</h6>
<p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets associated with Digg, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h6>Information Disclosed for the Protection of Us and Others:</h6>
<p>We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce these Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public.
