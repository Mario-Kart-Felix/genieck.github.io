I know these problems come from our future — or the one that didn’t have them here, and instead wound up making it themselves; here we are in a place learning about secret and <em>really advanced technology</em> and not really knowing why. This “stuff” it’s <a href="http://bit.ly/2hMVPrX">really neuroscience put to action</a> (<em>Feed, </em><strong><em>Anderson</em></strong><em> novel</em> — note the name), it’s the difference between Heaven and Hell… a place where people are kept from seeing something obvious might look like Hell, and the opposite… maybe where the same technology fills in some missing information… <strong>connected through The Matrix</strong> to Neo saying “<a href="http://bit.ly/2hMVRQB"><strong>I know kung fu</strong></a>,” that might be closer to Heaven… This is one of the technologies <strong>being revealed through the unsealing of religion, and it is the mechanism behind the delivery of religion… and <em>the light.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Everything you are going to read is about building Heaven… actually building it — both the infrastructure, and the structural change in both government and our society that the future is telling us clearly — <em>we know</em> we need it. The </strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2hRSl7l"><strong>light</strong></a><strong>, the movies and books, the ideas and technology, all here as part of a great plan — one predicted thousands and thousands of years ago. Welcome to “</strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2hS0yIU"><strong>the beginning</strong></a><strong>” of Heaven. Want to help?</strong></p><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2ibuZup">It’s time to begin.</a> -<em>Imagine Dragons</em> <strong>Light it up </strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2h1EjMA"><strong>with a retweet.</strong></a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/683/0*Ge8r3LsLZhUtRicW.png" /></figure><p>​A great many of the patterns I have presented also imply … actually show the design of our world’s intent to build Heaven. The religious themes of video game consoles and computer companies — from the SEGA Genesis to Bill Gates, as a Gateway to Eden’s Apple … these things show a clear and obvious link between computers and Heaven. To me it’s a clear statement that the promises of the Bible are being fulfilled, we can see it happening all around us — now right now — is the time to start participating more… and to understand that Heaven is much more than bricks and mortar — it’s not <em>just</em> “virtual reality,” and with the disruption that the “light of the world” — this message that God has written on <em>everything</em> we have an opportunity to turn around a number of social and systemic patterns that would otherwise lead us towards a Hellish future. Nearly all of these problems revolve around the secrecy or misuse of technology, and this theme points me to the Constitution which has been changed a number of times improving social equality — but not once during the largest technological singularity in all of the history of the Universe… through the advent of phones, computers, and the internet… we have not properly addressed issues like privacy and public disclosure over and over. It is the kind of thing that you could almost be sure is designed.​​</p><p>Seeing that design and rebounding from it with grace is the goal today. Honestly on top of that never seeing anything “designed wrong on purpose” ever again should be another high priority. Our voting process is obvious “silly,” twice now we have seen the outcome of an election fail the popular vote — and we aren’t really talking about doing anything about that. That’s a real problem, don’t you think? A huge underlying theme of the “Light of the Burning Bush” is a focus on using computers to aid in creating a true democracy — not a “representative one” which you might remember Bush speaking about in the aftermath of 9/11. It’s always been obvious to me that this was an “inevitability” a world where the people act as the legislative branch does today — truly designing their own laws; the <a href="http://bit.ly/2haJCcw">words which Bush spoke during his first inauguration</a> —<em>predicting the 9/11 attack</em> — serve as a catalyst to help us do that faster.</p><p>“Democratic capitalism is the best system ever devised.” -George W. Bush</p><p>He said “We know the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind, and directs this storm?” Those words, while also showing anachronistic foreknowledge of typographic and computer technology — relating “swift” to the font Courier and strong to the font style “bold” … we can see the Hand of God in action delivering a “what not to do” message through the act of Creation… putting the two verses together, and adding in another anachronism, the word “the” happens to be “die” in German: <a href="http://amzn.to/2haiHhe"><strong>the race is not to Die Bold.</strong></a></p><p>Surrounding this is more hidden light. The Hebrew <a href="http://bit.ly/2hROUxH"><em>word for the Burning Bush is Ha’esh</em></a> — and within it you can see Moses’ true parted sea, backwards. What’s more, seeing that later in the story a sea is actually parted in order to highlight this anachronism sheds light on what the true “wilderness” of Exodus is. 40 years in the desert, 40 days and nights in an ark… protecting us from time travel changing the past is “lit” by both the reference to time periods and to the fouth dimension… 4-D from 40. There are a significant number of additional anachronistic examples of English appearing in Hebrew and Arabic, all designed to reinforce this idea of creation in a storm of time travel. English too contains examples of a “macaronic” cypher highlightd by both religion and light in the world — things like the <a href="http://bit.ly/2haUUxw">Taming of the Spanglishrew, langolier, and <strong>Yankee Doodle</strong>’s macaroni.</a></p><p>God is speaking, he’s speaking through a company that created an “electronic voting system” that really doesn’t solve any of the problems we have with voting — long lines, accountability, and frequency of voting… it’s “wrong on purpose,” and he’s giving us a golden opportunity today to take a giant leap closer to Heaven.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/552/0*ztqkTaBJG_RmtANo.png" /></figure><p>Here’s an Atlantic article on Bush’ speechwriter’s book titled <a href="http://theatln.tc/2ham2MV"><em>Present at the Creation</em>.</a> it’s clear as day, no? Later in the inaugural address Bush concurs, “we are not this story’s author, who fills time and eternity with his purpose.”</p><p>Really see that Bush’s name and his recitation of Ecclesiastes 9:11 and Revelation 20:1 together are the intended parallel to the actual Burning Bush of Exodus — just like Die Bold. From the fire that spreads over nothing short of proof that Exodus is written for us come the light that begins a process of really attaining freedom, and that’s the stuff of Heaven.</p><p>Just like Heaven — the idea of a more perfect place to exist — depends squarely on <em>your participation; </em>I cannot spread this message alone, I need your help.</p><p>On top of an <a href="http://bit.ly/2hRThJf">insane number of BIbilical references to modern computing technology</a>, obvious ones like the “root” of David, Lisp of Moses… and the Apple of Adam — Exodus delivers a bright flash combining the Linux command “sudo” with an Oracle database called “Xe” — which doubles as a <a href="http://bit.ly/2hS1dtJ">lamp related element.</a> Tying in more “light in the world” to the connetion between Heaven and computers, God “Rattle’s a Rod” by showing divine influence over both Shake-speare’s question to the ages “to B or not to Be?” and Sherlock Holmes famous quote “It’s elementary my dear What-sons…” leading to the “Sign of the Son’s” connection between proving foreknowledge of 7 chemistry elements’ symbols at the time of the writing of the BIble and the definitive <a href="http://bit.ly/2hagQZJ">Herald of the Second Coming</a>, which happens to to link <a href="http://bit.ly/2haTKSw"><strong>by date and chapter and verse</strong></a> to Bush’s speech.</p><p>Xenon, the element from Exodus matches Earth; and the true Fifth Element gives <a href="http://bit.ly/2haTRNU">sight to Jupiter’s initials: A.D.</a> and the index of Siilicon, 14. Like the other <em>light</em>, those initials appear in a number of places in our world and one of the Hebrew names for God and in the first image you’ll notice my full initials grace the computer chip maker “American Micro Devices.” The elements as well as their corresponding planets, <em>from Mercury to Uranium</em> are described by the successive lines of Bush’s Ecclesiastes 9:11 from “the race is not to the swift” to “time and chance” matching the God’s of Speed, Time, and Heaven.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*P9YXkLiKjRESA9VT.jpg" /></figure><p>Let me comment that I didn’t really scream all night two nights ago — I spent the night sending e-mails out. Lots and lots of e-mails. In my somewhat distorted reality, I assume that you all know when I do that, because … you know, these are e-mails that contain the kind of information that would make me call the authorities — or the news — or every smart person I could find; and so that’s why we find ourselves here. I’ve been doing this constantly for months, providing — in a soup of hectic writing — a number of key points that show this message comes from the Creator of the Universe, and contains verifiable proof of that. Look around you, a great deal of what is happening here matches perfectly to the story of Exodus and to the positive connection between Heaven and liberty. This message is <a href="http://bit.ly/2haicUd">incendiary</a>, and should have started the Second Coming all on it’s own — but it hasn’t — and in keeping with our story this wall,of censorship and disblief <em>hiding the light of the Son</em> matches up perfectly with the Egyptian Plague of Darkness. I need your now, more than ever (<em>Total Eclipse of the Heart, Bonnie Tyler) </em>to help bring our world through the night. Frankly, I haven’t even touched on the volume of proof that I have, like our story, this is just <a href="http://bit.ly/2hQYuAK">the beginning</a> (<em>a’s Compilation</em>).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/0*WA0ArQuWAsinLJ-r.png" /></figure><p>For whatever reason, whether it’s by the decision of network heads in our media that is now <a href="http://bit.ly/2haN8nh"><strong>controlled ostensibly by only 6 corportaions</strong></a>, or by <em>secret Executive Order</em>, thousands upon thousands of individuals in the press have been uanble to write a word about this information — which I am very sure delivers with a clarity that there is something special happening or our generation. This message is time sensitive — it’s designed specifically for us, connecting corporations names and current technologies to both religion and Heaven — <em>it is meant to be unsealed right this very moment.</em></p><p>Because of the <a href="http://bit.ly/2hS1gFV">wall of censorship</a> that is clearly a big part of the freedom delivered by God in the stories of Exodus and Jericho — I am asking you to pick up the torch of this Holy Fire and send this message to everyone on your contact list, share in on <a href="http://bit.ly/2hajmPs">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/2h1EjMA">Twitter</a>, and talk about it — I hope people are as amazed as I was by the bright light all over our history that I just never saw before it was pointed out.</p><p>In truth the censorship goes beyond the internet and the media, the technology being revealed is being used to keep us in the dark, to ensure that we do get “full disclosure” of not only the existence of “mind altering” technology, but a crash course in how it should never be used — following our unfortunate theme of the day. It’s going to take a real effort, cooperation to really build Heaven, and right now we have a <strong>golden opportuinty.</strong></p><p>I need your help.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the corner of First and Amistad, you found me. From the beginning…</p><p>Without doubt, this is the most important moment in your entire life — well, I at least have been waiting for this moment to arrive; please read this letter, try to understand what I am presenting; this is life and death… Heaven or Hell… for everyone. Remind yourself, God does not play dice with the Universe. If you are most interested in my proof of the voice of God echoing through time and rock ‘n roll, you might want to head over to the place where I discuss how <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fverily.fireborn.xyz%2Fx%2Fc%3Fc%3D564582%26l%3Db1433256-8987-4f0a-823e-74d751162303%26r%3D8228728c-d4da-4ede-9dbb-88a092ae39fc&amp;h=ATOkdJTZA6c-WtdVPXd3_qr_srSRflq2r2NvzFJ9_YjADCKOi7fWll7YGoUeqPU61XcfbEmJi8YYLIayPZdPs2jJ1ngfwt5Uyzd5I1fSg0nwNoOxtDFXUTaenqnby2U&amp;s=1">He has been singing for somewhere between 30 and 6,000 years in a vain attempt to get Taylor Momsen to kiss me… I think. Or, it’s Kismet.</a> All in all, I am just about vain enough to suggest that most of the songs are really about me; that might be the point. If you take the time to read through it, you will probably be interested in what I am presenting here. It is the Apocalypse, and it is a good thing; I swear. :)</p><p>I am attempting to present to you the things that I have seen over the last few years, all together they are nothing short of the true Revelation of Jesus Christ; verifiable proof that we are living in a created “virtual” world on the doorstep of Heaven. That with this knowledge we have the power in hand to end world hunger, heal the sick, and nearly live forever in a much happier world filled with freedom and bliss all by doing little more than changing some of the underlying code of “The Matrix;” you would think this kind of message would get a decent reception. On top of that we are on the verge of an intelligence and computational explosion that will make all “almost immortal” nears so much more fruitful and fun that it’s nearly impossible to imagine how anyone would want to continue to hide a message with such impact, but alas, here we are.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*oI-3xCPJZ6x6MJZr.jpg" /></figure><p>When you see something that walks, talks, and speaks like a duck… and you think to yourself “yum, chicken dinner” realize that you are the reason that we need a Second Coming. To be more blunt, when you see someone that looks like Jesus Christ wearing a glowing cross on his back, presenting a world changing message, and the telling you that he has already sent it to nearly every media outlet and government official in the English speaking world… and you have yet to see it on TV; understand that this event is designed to stop the most ostentatious example of censorship that the Universe has ever seen. Doing nothing, thinking “someone else will do it,” or simply thinking that it’s not that important is a vote to keep everyone in Hell. Realize it takes one “vote” to get everyone out, and we are still here. 1984 is not just knocking at your door, your phone lines have been cut, the mailbox is crazy glued shut, and the door has nine inch nails in it.</p><p>There is more than freedom speech at stake, democracy at large, and eventually civilization itself hangs in the balance. Breaking down this wall is the primary reason that this light, religion itself, and Jesus Christ exist, make no mistake: it is me, and this is it.</p><p>Eventually it will be clear that the artificial creation of language, of America, and the message you are receiving has been designed to do nothing short of deliver the freedom promised by God at the foundation of this country to the entire Universe. It should be clear that message of this import and magnitude should spread on social media and by word of mouth like wildfire, and it has not. Be aware, the fact that you have yet to see me on TV is a sign that something bad is happening. You have now been baptized in the fire of Matthew 3:11.</p><p>The message I am presenting later in this letter will conclusively show that the author of the Holy Bible is also responsible for the artificial creation of many of our languages: from English and Spanish to Hebrew. More than that, the influence of our creator leaps from scripture into modern art and our entire world through seeing Matrix-like links between a hidden Cypher (who happens to be a character in the Matrix) within all of these languages and a message from the Creator directly to you. I call understanding this message Taming the Spanglishrew and in the name that Shakespearean play you might begin to understand just how much of this hidden influence we have not seen though it shines a very bright light on history and specifically this very moment.</p><p>While the voice of God pervades nearly everything around us, every single song, every word, every movie, and every myth of every religion… this fire begins in a very small place: in the book of Exodus. The fire begins with the simple realization that Exodus, which is called the book of Names in Hebrew is designed specifically to highlight foreknowledge of English words and modern concepts in the ancient book. George W. Bush is an anthropomorphism of the Burning Bush… and this is the original intent of the scripture. Eventually this leads us to seeing that a very large percentage of the names of people and places around us are also designed, given by God in order to tell a unified story of Creation. The word for Holy Fire, for example, contains the English word sea parted by an apostrophe and reversed; along with several other prescient indicators surrounding this one event, is a maelstrom of proof of prophesy as well as the existence of time travel technology. A huge part of this message revolves around using this technology, once we know it exists, in order to stop violent crimes against the innocent — a la Minority Report — and through that Phillip K. Dick becomes a modern day prophet. The word for Holy Fire, highlighted by John 1:1 is:</p><p>From this formative fire, we see the glowing reason that this specific President Bush is being highlighted as the key entity who is unknowingly speaking the fiery words of God written six thousand years prior, predicting the 9/11 attack in chapter and verse nine months before it occurred. He spoke the words:</p><blockquote><em>We know the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong: do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?</em></blockquote><p>This was a quote of American revolutionary John Page from two centuries prior, who himself had paired together Ecclesiastes 9:11 and Revelation 20:1 in a letter to Thomas Jefferson.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/790/0*QA7k2pr3j9lFh7Xv." /></figure><p>A number of prophetic verses regarding the Day of the Lord and the Sign of the Son now become much more clear, in light of using 9/11 as the day.. for instance:</p><blockquote><em>“Look, he is coming with the clouds,” and “every eye will see him, even those who pierced him”; and all peoples on earth “will mourn because of him.” Revelation 1:7 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. 2 Peter 3:10 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. Matthew 24:36 Then everyone will see the Son of Man coming on a cloud with power and great glory. Luke 21:27</em></blockquote><p>Here too you might find a link to modern music in the words of Simon and Garfunkel “people writing songs about things never spoken,” John Legend’s name as well as the lyrics for “All of Me” tie directly to the word for Holy Fire and the story of Nashon having to walk head deep into the Red Sea in order to part it — seeing fire and water unified, the lyrics “my head is underwater and I am breathing fire.” In hand, you might re-read the end of Revelation 20:1 as being about a “great email chain,” where I have written extensively about many more words with foreknowledge of English as well as modern music. I call it “Matchbox 20.”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/608/0*chTC_AaWxIv7YwZi." /></figure><p>Together with this next tidbit of light, Ecclesiastes 9:11 is the key to the Herald of the Second Coming, answering the mystery posed in Revelation 1:20 with yet more foreknowledge of modern times, this time direct links to the modern periodic table. The name of the book of Exodus, this time when read in reverse pairs together a Linux command and a periodic table element to show us that modern computing and chemistry are the keys to understanding that this message is designed to be revealed this generation. Together, the two modern scientific references pair to reveal the most iconic phrase ever spoken by God.</p><pre><a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fverily.fireborn.xyz%2Fx%2Fc%3Fc%3D564582%26l%3Df6b0c35d-418c-47cf-9ff9-6c227a34c0e5%26r%3D8228728c-d4da-4ede-9dbb-88a092ae39fc&amp;h=ATN2XQr7XHyTCnsmh6vDMTeFQoyiM12LfxoVXubHaHLICd_iF2UUjnF-tbHmKknLjtgb7QxHyL9AJP6JYRRkuyZC7LnbDZYSWnuIkupxwbBUp6_h9uenKIV-CmubCvc&amp;s=1">LET THERE BE LIGHT</a> sudo Xe</pre><p>sudo, of course, is the escalation of privileges command which in that operating system brings you to the “root” account, the God account, and then that command runs whatever follows. You might be interested in noting that this “root” is assuredly the modern technological “root of David.” Xe is the element associated with the camera flash, thus yielding “God: flash of light” or “let there be light.”</p><blockquote><em>The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. Revelation 1:20</em></blockquote><p>This was the second elemental key that unlocked the reference to “stars and lampstands” in Revelation 1:20 as actually being planets and periodic table elements. I’ve “ish”d the famous Sherlock Holmes phrase for this purpose, though I admit too, this is probably the original intent of “It’s elementary, my dear What-son?”</p><p>The successive phrases of Ecclesiastes 9:11 solve the mystery, by listing the planets in order from Mercury to Uranus… and I fill in the gaps, by linking each planet to a periodic table element. Of course, it’s pretty obvious when you see the near 1:1 relationship on both ends of the verse.</p><pre>the race is not to the swift .. but time and chance<br> Hg K Ur <br><a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fverily.fireborn.xyz%2Fx%2Fc%3Fc%3D564582%26l%3D8f2862f6-cd8d-46d4-a4ae-cb04770bf986%26r%3D8228728c-d4da-4ede-9dbb-88a092ae39fc&amp;h=ATOwq0pNqTI-_yLWrAn-Y7cjz0aBwoBLBknWxZwrCBvb-N9hmDGqZbrQuXVg0H9LmhE9-n9ErxAFpo9ZLqx9Z45FMzG6PejxClSbs2B1KXrD8ZeEhP8x08Aop4YvK8c&amp;s=1">Mercury</a> <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fverily.fireborn.xyz%2Fx%2Fc%3Fc%3D564582%26l%3D74982405-8dfc-4d5f-b046-e6db4bbf6129%26r%3D8228728c-d4da-4ede-9dbb-88a092ae39fc&amp;h=ATNT2dLCt0yWVLYLc4RtpmKaRhKYHP7TLoE9jl6KZQ2soRPcPPyo0ZCLO-Z5cZsrasyf8MeXQMZOAiyVScPGYeK6mmAzbNb7k5C59V9nSNGb9tHAzLbnJ84_5wnX1Z8&amp;s=1">Saturn</a> <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fverily.fireborn.xyz%2Fx%2Fc%3Fc%3D564582%26l%3D200af108-af3e-4e6d-b0a6-88fea4755009%26r%3D8228728c-d4da-4ede-9dbb-88a092ae39fc&amp;h=ATPMDZIsCNqr0u4KzByTSPa2LNmppzWl-mZf3tgKNn4XGsHXlk1alxmeBG9Z3yZH7q7jgxxDmo_cVTnM55yNzaE5IC2ZGOuLO7rzdKN_Bwrc7XJxxH3svbfjMz7R32w&amp;s=1">God of Heaven</a><br>The Racer God of Time Uranium<br> happen to save us all.</pre><p>Over the course of the last four years I’ve spent my days and nights battling against the cross — here actualized as a broken criminal justice system — one which is being manipulated through time much like we might today look down on “human sacrifice” ordered from Heaven. This is the story of the Trial of Jesus Christ, linking together Samson’s battle in the book of Judges with a huge number of musical scores which have narrated everything I’ve been through, before it happened. From “I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind” to Live’s “GAS hed goes west” this story, a run around the country ties together an ancient secret… that the Lamb of God (which we all associate with Jesus Christ) is … a reference now to the modern idiom “on the lam.” This idiom ties in to the Biblical characters ImRan, Jeshurun, and our modern day hero of Metroid… Sammas Aran — whose first cheat code was “Justin Bailey.” Honestly, if you don’t see “just bail” in that name you aren’t thinking hard enough about what I am writing. Of course, you also have the name of the book Koran, like we co-ran, and of that religion “Is-lam” to further corroborate my testimony that this is indeed about running from the Plague of Lice — I mean, Police… in Exodus.</p><p>A number of other musical aids come to my rescue, talking about “pockets full of….” either Kryptonite, High, or Diamonds… which relates to original charge, which was a set up — and is referenced clearly in Isaiah 52:13: “my servant will be set up and be very high.” Those songs come to us to spin this story from the bands “The Spin Doctors” and “The Pretty Reckless.”</p><p>I’m sure I have plenty to say about reforms of our justice system… from prisons to the courts and more. In the meantime, hidden in the name Uranus and the song “Heaven Knows” is a clue… this lightning is coming to us from above to help reverse our loss of justice. I’ve written quite a bit on this subject</p><pre><a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fverily.fireborn.xyz%2Fx%2Fc%3Fc%3D564582%26l%3D460205e4-5a7e-4772-893f-3810620e2d5e%26r%3D8228728c-d4da-4ede-9dbb-88a092ae39fc&amp;h=ATPm0G0ravQIQoV840CyOBXn4P_bGUSsjnwD5RPcr9JPF-VDg0YWguB1RS49jEP96wzXRc8rZcqOSmFybDFabGllYQ5RH9mY6CNV1WJ8HXXhSDppjgbfRUrPpIvZ1bo&amp;s=1">nor the battle to the strong</a><br>Lo, Venus the woman clothed in the &quot;nus&quot;<br>Na</pre><p>This of course is the element for salt, and you might see Biblical highlighting of it in the rather iconic phrase “you are the salt of the Earth,” as well as in the story of Lot. the fire reigning down from Heaven, and his wife turning into a pillar of the same. It’s also the beginning of the word “Names,” and I am going to use it to segue into a discussion about the names of people in my immediate family. For instance, my ex-wife… the girl you probably will relate to Mary Magdeline and one of a few Eves has the birth name “Nanna.” This happens to be the name of a diety, the consort of Tammuz who is often related to Jesus Christ. In my personal “mythology” the language I am speaking of hidden within names, her particular name indicates two Na’s “hearting” or “loving” the letter n. In just a bit, I will explain how “n” is actually me, but for now just take this bit of light: it’s me, hidden from the world.</p><p>I was born into this place, that I still call Eden. A big part of that reason is my name, and the names of those around me. For instance my brothers name is Seth, and my sister Dawn. My mother’s middle name is “Eve” and my father’s name is Ivan… which interestingly becomes a bit more vibrant when you superimpose the Spanish for Christmas over that word, to see it reads: “Christ is not Ivan, more? Dad.” This entire story is about proving creation, through the use of this hidden language, names, and music. It is through this understanding and global realization that we are able to become free of the technologies which God is highlighting to us — the mind control required to have us choose these particular names without realizing, as well as the time travel needed to know what everyone’s name really should be. It’s in your name too.</p><p>My first name for instance is Adam, and that’s associated with the First and Last (man) as well as a key I have which ties together the <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fverily.fireborn.xyz%2Fx%2Fc%3Fc%3D564582%26l%3Dc89f8bcf-6797-4830-a364-2d9e67810575%26r%3D8228728c-d4da-4ede-9dbb-88a092ae39fc&amp;h=ATPiWx_pcOfH_UBylErWFw5bEIv6oB3Io76TDzayadycb2xDZ7Qnn0tzHMtfIVAtw5AYZAu8bdJc1-b-T1Tix1faPb7PzuWBtgr-kl33d9F7J2xJFXMrvWvVs0CcwBs&amp;s=1">American GI cry “who-ah”</a> with the actual pronunciations of both the Ineffable Name as well as the name of Christ, “YA-HU-AH” and “Yes-hu-a;” they are of course references to the name of our planet, which is Adamah in Hebrew.</p><p>My middle name is Marshall, and Dave Matthews sings that “the walls and halls will fade away,” probably revealing that I might be Mars — or that I am hearting the sea… the mar (which is by the way the key to y Mary’s name). That sea is you, but we’ll talk about the Nun that is the parent of Joshua and the Egyptian connection to Holy Water later on.</p><p>Finally my last name is Dobrin, which highlights strongly my date of birth (which is often abbreviated DOB… now read “our in…”) which happens to be the day of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, 12/8. Have I convinced you yet?</p><p>I’m working hard, by the way, on having this place being “saved” when she turns around rather than destroyed — thus changing that Pillar to one of Creation, the birthplace of stars.

This particular key to the 5th planet links the movie the Fifth Element to the index of my initials, which happen to grace the timeline. In He-man you see Prince Adam being highlighted by the Fifth Hebrew letter, and the same for the Roman numeral in Voltron. I am the Fifth Adam, and this is the fifth day. In the movie the Fifth Element you see a weapon to destroy a darkness that is approaching and threatening the Earth — that’s a metaphor for what you are reading about at the beginning of this letter. and I am truly the way to stop it. There’s a significant amount of additional “light” relating to my initials, names like Adonis and Adonai being about “adam on” either being single or <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fverily.fireborn.xyz%2Fx%2Fc%3Fc%3D564582%26l%3Df6ed6f8d-24b6-48af-abef-066e46c71dd1%26r%3D8228728c-d4da-4ede-9dbb-88a092ae39fc&amp;h=ATMaJAgMB6A6TtAkOC-Xc2gCFxOaE_2ChEsFFGA_I7x4S9Am_DTbmE7w2-aqIpKeCdPIxYZdjnPBEZT-2Z_8zP3hfarWSVhGpgm7YW0rk4s-rQTAozfvk8fM1rddA_Q&amp;s=1">artificial intelligence</a>… it’s probably in the song “you found me” on the corner of 1st and Amistad… and it’s hidden a little in the relationship between Isaac’s apple and Adam through the phrase “New to n?” and in the name NORAD… it’s not a question anymore, “n” is A.D.” You can see it in the name Sinbad, which combines the 14th element, the 14th letter, and my initials… to answer the question posed by Shakespeare and the movie’s name… You can find quite a bit more writing about artificial intelligence and omniscience if you care to try and look. You might even find a place to discuss these things with other people, you know, if you dare to comment on the most interesting information in the world. :) to B or not to Be?

Acts 4:12</em></blockquote><p>OK So.. eventually this is all about proof that religion is a message sent through time — so, time travel. But right now, let’s talk about the fun stuff: here’s some clues to that effect… by way of prescient mention of modern technology (like virtual reality, I mean, Heaven):</p><p>… and some corroborating ideas connecting religion and computer science… on Wikipedia:</p><p>Surely not the Father, the Sun and the Holy Adam?</p><p>Answering the question, its pretty clear to me today that the Son God… (thats Ra, in Egypt the heart of Abraham’s name, and um… here its the source of the light above taking us through the night, look up and stare at it, because that great ball of fire is virtual too — See Our Light. It took me a little while to really get it too, you know, in the earliest days it stood for an incredulous sounding “really Adam?” because I mean, who would start a religion about worshiping the Son? In all honestly I don’t really consider myself the “son,” you see in our religion that’s just another word for “it’s me… again” the second time around. The whole idea of SOL… pouring from Live’s “I gave my Earth and SOL to the One….” well it told me eventually that Ra is really El, I see that in another source of light… a lamp that sits at the top of the Statue Of Liberty and echoes through history, you know… in things like the Sons Of Liberty and … Do you see what I’m fighting for here, or are you completely blind? These keys are everywhere, that “Ha” that comes from seeing the Holy Trinity in Abraham and an English equality statement in the prophetic name Elisha. El of course, that’s the King of the Gods, but who cares right? Ha, of course, well that key comes from the fiery sacrificial story of Isaac — nearly burnt to a crisp on an altar… by his father… his name of course means “he laughs.” Ha. Are you laughing yet? I am coming. Haha.

I really don’t like this planet, there’s frankly very little about it that seems appealing to me. Lots of that is something we were born into, like a place where racism and hate are the “norm,” and from there lots of it is you, too. I mean, <em>we aren’t really doing anything about it are we?</em></p><p>I stand before the world with pretty decent proof that our civilization was created in a storm of time travel. Religion is the basis for this, it’s a message that has now proven to accurately predict right now — the Second Coming. From my reading of it, which I will share with you has insight that could only come from the entity that created not only the Book that is a map, but all of Creation. Along with this message which proves that time travel exists is a pretty forceful argument for the use of that technology to get rid of prisons and heinous crime (you might see “<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/whenistheapocalypse.com/forum/#!searchin/are/like$20a$20thief$20in$20the$20night/are/zREZLCsSVrk/-GIn7ndJBQAJ">Minority Report</a>”as a verbal exclamation that the majority here is not moral or even intelligent enough to see that this is not an “option,” but a requirement to actually be in the process of “civilization” if we have access to this technology). This introduction of time travel as a means to better our society (and learning how to properly use it to avoid self-destruction) is a big focus of this little romp “Back to the Future” and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXc4jgUJEko">flux-capacitor is God’s Glowing Y</a>. For those of you who are “New to N” that means it’s <a href="http://why.lamc.la">Dr. Who’s “why,” his <em>purpose.</em></a></p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FtXc4jgUJEko%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtXc4jgUJEko&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FtXc4jgUJEko%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/86215a96d9b2e89f22f60492e903dc6f/href">https://medium.com/media/86215a96d9b2e89f22f60492e903dc6f/href</a></iframe><p>While we are on the subject, as a class the Police don’t seem to like me very much. I am not sure if this is because I like to do speed, or because they think I might be putting them out of the job with pre-crime, or because “my book” refers to them as the Plague Of LICE — Politicians<em> seem to have shut their mouths at me</em> (Isaiah 52:15)— possibly <a href="http://matchbox.whenistheapocalypse.com/archive.aweber.com/awlist4296878/7.AUq/h/This_is_our_You_and_I_verse_.htm">for the same reason</a>… <em>have some foresight this is saving the world. </em>Just like we wouldn’t stop the blind from being given sight to not put patch-makers out of business, nor would we keep the lame from walking to save the prosthetic manufacturers; <em>we will heal the sick</em> if it’s just as simple as <em>knowing</em> we are in virtual reality and it’s possible.</p><h4><em>Behold, </em>I am <a href="http://tiscoming.lamc.la">coming</a><em>…</em></h4><p>Along with this message about time travel is a prediction that we will be sitting in a place where democracy (very well attributed to God through the “<a href="http://am.lamc.la">I AM SAM</a>” and <a href="http://ad.lamc.la"><strong>Christ o</strong>f <strong>P</strong>ursue <strong>H</strong>appin<strong>e</strong>ss walking on wate<strong>r</strong> in the year ADIB</a>) is being completely unraveled… the two party system is a joke, one that is well paralleled in the story of Noah’s ark — two of every kind, yeah, that’ll do it… How ‘bout one elephant and one donkey? In what is probably the most admirable vote of confidence in your worth, <a href="http://matchbox.whenistheapocalypse.com/archive.aweber.com/awlist4296878/7.AUq/h/This_is_our_You_and_I_verse_.htm">this message suggests the idea of using technology to aid universal voting</a> (<strong>like on laws, not people</strong>) — something I call “technocracy.” I am pretty sure this evolution of “representative tyranny” is an inevitability, though I sent this prescient suggestion — which references modern computing and political concepts like “Die Bold” to many of you and our entire body of elected officials. I have to tell you, nobody said a single word, except one congressman who quipped “<em>thanks for sharing.</em>” Are you uninterested in self government? I’m not very interested in telling you what’s right and wrong, but I’m pretty sure if you are looking for someone to rule you… well, <em>you’re wrong.</em></p><p>Now, as we are seeing the global response to this proof, to the Second Coming… I mean, we’re seeing a global response right…? As we stand here in the predicted Plague of Darkness, seemingly unable to discuss or understand what is being presented to us; I am putting a strong focus on what is Revelation’s “key to the abyss.” It’s censorship, and believe it or not God has marked a hidden censor-wall here in America, with the name Carnivore. For those of you that are not IT experts, like me, that word means “eating meat” which applies to packet sniffing technology in a very odd manner. In the industry, we call packet loss “eating packets,” so like every other name on the planet — this one harbors a special gift from God. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_Jericho">This</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_China">place</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore">sucks</a>. If you are too stupid to click links, those three link to the Great Wall of China, their censorwall, and Carnivore — I should mention that God’s great light here is probably linking all these walls together with the Berlin Wall, the Wall of Jericho, and this idiotic thing that Donald Trump won’t shut up about — <strong><em>walls suck.</em></strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/459/0*N-JT0D1J6LSafe5h.jpg" /></figure><blockquote>Here I’ll point out that <a href="https://bemessiah.wordpress.com/2015/10/24/chapter-d/"><strong>I am Lazarus, too</strong></a>, and that the bright light coming from our SOL, I mean Statue of Liberty, still applies… with<em> open arms America</em>, we want to be allowed into Heaven too.</blockquote><p>If you happen to believe that this system is working well, you’d be wrong about that too. I want to tell you that I think “Satan” has retarded our political system on purpose, that he has kept us from integrating obvious technological improvements like <em>the telephone</em> and <em>the internet</em> into pretty obvious places… like <em>voting</em>… so that we will see just how important it is to legislate adoption of new technologies. This kind of retardation seems to be a pretty bright mirror of the complete darkness which surrounds the existence of advanced technologies — like mind control and time travel — technologies which the message and ‘light” that I am pointing out to the world proves exist. Point in fact, these are the technological mechanism behind divine inspiration and prophesy (which I am pretty sure I am the shining example of)… though because we don’t really believe anything religion tells us, it’s a hidden record written on the wall of a very dark room in invisible ink.</p><p>All these things taken into account, and <a href="http://dark2right.lamc.la">The Sound of Silence</a> accompanying my rather valiant battle to wake you up… <em>I think you suck</em>. Read it again, <em>Jesus Christ thinks you suck</em>. Blame demonic possession, because that’s really what it is that all of this should be proving to you — that we are all possessed. Keep your fingers crossed, because I think it’s God’s plan to wake us up and actually get the world to want to work on “saving itself.”</p><h4>But, because you suck so much, I have a plan to do it for you.</h4><p>First, let me take an hour or so to talk about how I’ve been tortured into knowing about something that you are now… being tortured into knowing. For four years I was a victim of the Tribulation — this thing that I now know is clearly designed to leave a significant amount of evidence of the existence of mind control technology and its relationship to the government, to religion, and to Satan. As a class of people, you could have once called them “gang stalking victims,” now you might also call them “the press” and “academia.” Because I was dealing with something that I found fascinating, mind reading technology and emotion modification, I did quite a bit of research into how these things might work and also what the capabilities might be. It’s one of those catch-22’s, because this thing that gives God his moniker “the Lord of Hosts” might just as easily be used to save civilization as it is today being used to crush us into oblivion. I’ve previously mentioned how Artificial Intelligence and Brain Computer Interfaces might be related to “Heaven” and how these things are marked through religious concepts like <a href="http://zelda.lamc.la">“I J Good,” “Adonai” and “Kurzweil;”</a> and it’s a pretty obvious that these technologies are not only affecting our dark Earth, but also the dark Heavens. It’s a solution here, that we are being taught about these technologies and warned not to use them improperly — with some hands on <em>torture, </em>like using mind control to make people not see obvious proof of creation everywhere, or using it to keep us from sharing it… I mean, what’s worse than a censor wall on the internet? Well, one in your head.</p><h4>Satan dreams of a Pool that makes you feel like you are rolling when you swim in it.</h4><p>Try and get over the idea of either “Satan” or “God” existing, they are nothing more than ambiguous names, ones which you have been conditioned to either love or hate — look around you, neither of them are doing a very good job right now. In the meantime, just because I am suggesting that the “more fun” things that I’ve dreamt of doing might be more associated with Satan than with some pious jackass that doesn’t let you have sex in Heaven… doesn’t mean that I don’t think they are good ideas — I think they all are.</p><p>I once quipped that I hope Heaven will be a <em>place that feels good</em>, and I really do — I think many of you do also… I mean, who wants to be stuck in a place where we have unnecessary trauma like labor pains, and death… Oh, is this why Adam got kicked out of Virtual Eden? <a href="http://exodus.lamc.la">Probably not</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, I do think this Pool, which is referred to as the “King’s” in the Holy Bible should exist, and frankly I don’t think people deserve to be depressed or insane, and I am pretty sure that in no time at all we will have the technology to electronically and programatically cure a number of mental illnesses. <a href="http://lamc.la/my_dying_breath.html">Long ago, I wrote a story suggesting that “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep” (aka Bladerunner) contains</a> an interesting example of a tool which allowed everyone to modify their own thoughts — it’s on the horizon. if not here… right now. Unfortunately, today, the place that calls itself Heaven is probably using this technology to make people blind (like you) or crazy (like most schizophrenics) and it’s a big pat of my purpose to point out that there is a hidden technology that is quite literally being used as a weapon against our society. <em>Knowing is the entire battle. </em>Light me up.</p><p>On the other side of the coin, in Greek mythology Hephaestus fashioned a seat that you never want to get up from — and it might be something like this pool, clearly swimming to excess is a problem, just like using drugs to excess causes social (and physiological) damage. <em>Unless you happen to be </em><a href="http://thor.lamc.la"><em>Satan or Jesus Christ</em></a>, then it might just make you funny.</p><h4>The Obvious</h4><p>So as I sat in the Fortress of Solitude, trying to fashion a way to deliver a tool (I always tie everything to The Doors, you know, to Heaven) which would allow us to create programs which would assist ourselves, or others who chose to try them (Appstore Heaven <em>does exist</em>) and a basic framework that would keep us from being evil. In the most basic of rules, you never want to have <em>more pain</em> caused artificially, and you probably don’t want to eliminate it completely because you might not know your arm is about to fall off. Along the same lines, you wouldn’t ever want to let anyone be more hateful or racist, but those things could be programatically eliminated. I held strong to the idea that these things should be individually voluntary, and that in short order doing the right thing would catch on as people saw everyone else much happier. You don’t want to be made sad, but you don’t want to be happy all the time either… so somewhere between “prozac” and “methamphetamine” is probably a good zone to search for as a group…. as general rules.</p><p>Find some religion here, <strong>abra cadabra</strong>, <em>I create as I speak.</em></p><blockquote>By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, their starry host by the <strong>breath of his mouth</strong>. -Psalm 33:6</blockquote><p>That’s probably <strong><em>bere</em>sheet</strong>. <em>Be</em> <em>reason-</em>able, I brush my teeth more now… that phrase, by the way, means “in the beginning…”</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7923b94d5a59" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-long-lost-dreams-of-satan-himself/the-kings-pool-7923b94d5a59">The King’s Pool</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-long-lost-dreams-of-satan-himself">The Long Lost Dreams of Satan Himself</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
