					<description><![CDATA[“Deepwater Horizon is not the worst-case scenario,” one oceanographer warned.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This</em> <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/deepwater-horizon-oil-spill-10-year-anniversary_n_5e9a369ec5b63639081e9f8b?guccounter=1"><em>story</em></a> <em>was originally published by <a href="http://wired.com">HuffPost</a> </em><em>and is reproduced here as part of the</em> <a href="http://climatedesk.org/"><em>Climate Desk</em></a> <em>collaboration.</em></p>
<p>On the evening of April 20, 2010 &#8212; 10 years ago today &#8212; BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded while the fossil fuel giant was drilling an exploratory well off the coast of Louisiana, nearly a mile below the ocean surface.</p>
<p>The catastrophic event killed 11 workers and, over 87 days, unleashed a torrent of more than <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a6032/bp-oil-spill-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">200 million</a> gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico &#8212; the largest oil spill in U.S. history. An estimated 1 million birds and countless marine animals perished. Oil washed up along more than 1,300 miles of coastline in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, devastating local economies.</p>
<p>In the weeks after the blowout, President Barack Obama likened the spill to “an epidemic &#8212; one that we will be fighting for months and even years.” He vowed to hold responsible parties accountable and implement whatever regulatory reforms were needed to prevent similar disasters.</p>
<p>Indeed, a lot changed after the catastrophic incident. The Obama administration divided the Minerals Management Service, a <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/05/20/20greenwire-interior-unveils-plan-to-split-mms-into-3-agen-72654.html?pagewanted=all&amp;scp=7&amp;sq=restructure%2520MMS&amp;st=cse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scandal-plagued</a> federal agency that both issued offshore leases and policed drilling operations, into three separate agencies to avoid conflicts of interest. The oil industry created the Marine Well Containment Company, an independent nonprofit that has equipment at the ready to respond to future deepwater well incidents and contain the flow of gushing oil. And in 2016, the Interior Department’s <a href="https://www.bsee.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement</a> finalized major offshore drilling safety regulations.</p>
<p>But a decade after Deepwater, experts and environmental advocates warn that the U.S. remains woefully unprepared for a major spill &#8212; and is perhaps even more at risk of one due to the Trump administration’s relentless push to expand offshore drilling and gut environmental regulations.</p>
<p>“The question of whether we’re any better off &#8212; my concern is we’re actually headed towards the exact same type of circumstances that were in place” at the time of the Deepwater disaster, Elizabeth Johnson Klein, the Interior Department’s associate deputy secretary under Obama, told HuffPost. “I don’t feel good about it.”</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda has put pressure on industry to develop in new, riskier, and more expensive areas, Klein said. When companies are forced to cut costs, safety is typically one of the first things to take a back seat. Then there’s the industry-tied political leaders at Trump’s Interior Department, who Klein says “have not demonstrated that they’ve learned lessons from Deepwater Horizon.”</p>
<p>Interior Secretary David Bernhardt is a former oil and gas lobbyist whose clients included Halliburton, the oil services giant that in 2014 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/02/halliburton-11bn-settlement-deepwater-horizon-spill" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agreed to a $1.1 billion settlement</a> for its role in the 2010 blowout. Scott Angelle, the director of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, is a former board member of oil and gas pipeline company Sunoco Logistics Partners LP who, during his brief stint as lieutenant governor of Louisiana, led the state’s push to lift the moratorium on offshore drilling in the Gulf that the Obama administration put in place after Deepwater Horizon.</p>
<p>With little regard for climate change and other environmental impacts, the Trump administration has sought to transform the U.S. into the world’s leading fossil fuel behemoth. In January 2018, it rolled out a <a href="https://www.boem.gov/NP-Draft-Proposed-Program-2019-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial plan</a> to make nearly all U.S. waters &#8212; roughly 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf &#8212; available for oil and gas leasing, including large swaths of the Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans. In its proposal, Trump’s Interior Department <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-offshore-drilling-safety-regulations_n_5bc8dfe7e4b055bc947eb6b0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cited</a> Obama-era safety regulations put in place after Deepwater Horizon, noting that while offshore oil and gas production “will never be totally risk-free” the agency “has made, and is continuing to make, substantial reforms to improve the safety.” Those changes, it said, included rules to reduce the risk of a rig losing control of a well, as happened in the Deepwater disaster.</p>
<p>The administration then turned around and gutted the very safeguards it highlighted to make its case for expanded drilling, arguing that the regulations were burdensome on offshore producers. It <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-offshore-safety-measures_n_5a4590d4e4b06d1621b7e666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weakened</a> the Production Safety Systems Rule, loosening notification and certification rules for fossil fuel companies and scrapping a requirement that offshore equipment be designed to withstand the most extreme weather and pressure conditions. And it overhauled the Well Control Rule, a monitoring regulation that took effect in 2016 and required additional inspection and maintenance of blowout preventers, devices designed to automatically seal a well and stop an uncontrolled release of oil and gas. The Trump rollback eased inspection and oversight requirements.</p>
<p>“Today’s final rule puts safety first, both public and environmental safety, in a common sense way,” Bernhardt said in a <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/bsee-finalizes-improved-blowout-preventer-and-well-control-regulations">statement</a> at the time.</p>
<p>With fewer safeguards in place, the administration has plowed ahead with offshore leasing. Last month, as the deadly coronavirus pandemic gripped the nation, Interior offered at auction 78 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas producers. The lease sale brought in approximately $93 million for just shy of 400,000 acres, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-drilling-offshore/could-have-been-substantially-worse-u-s-offshore-oil-lease-sale-weakest-since-2016-idUSKBN2151E8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smallest total</a> for an offshore auction since 2016.</p>
<p>“As I see it, the essential lesson from Deepwater Horizon is that industry and government should be putting their greatest energies into preventing operational accidents, blowouts, and releases,” Donald Boesch, a professor of marine science at the University of Maryland who served on the bipartisan commission that investigated the causes of the Deepwater Horizon, wrote in a recent piece published in The Conversation. “Yet the Trump administration emphasizes increasing production and reducing regulations. This undermines safety improvements made over the past 10 years.”</p>
<p>The seven-member oil spill commission concluded in a 2011 report that a “culture of complacency” by both industry and government led to the Deepwater disaster. And while industry often says that offshore drilling has never been safer, others see things quite differently.</p>
<p>“Never safer than what?” Mark Davis, director of the Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy at Tulane University, said during a call with reporters last week. The underlying issue prior to Deepwater Horizon and still today is that the federal government has a “financial stake in the success” of offshore fossil fuel development, he said. Extracting oil is driven by policy rather than data.</p>
<p>“It was policy to believe that bad things wouldn’t happen, and it was policy that you don’t waste time planning for things that aren’t going to happen,” Davis said.</p>
<p>“Until we get our policies and legal architecture in line with the risks we are running, we are going to be very vulnerable,” he added.</p>
<p>Last week, ahead of the 10-year anniversary of Deepwater Horizon, ocean advocacy group Oceana <a href="https://usa.oceana.org/publications/reports/hindsight-2020-lessons-we-cannot-ignore-bp-disaster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a report</a> that documented the many economic and environmental impacts of the spill and concluded that “the poor safety culture and lack of oversight that led to the BP disaster persist.”</p>
<p>“If anything, another disaster is more likely, because the industry is drilling deeper and farther offshore, which increases the likelihood of a spill and makes responding to a spill more difficult,” the report stated.</p>
<p>“Indeed, Deepwater Horizon is not the worst-case scenario,” Ian MacDonald, an oceanography professor at Florida State University, said on a call with reporters last week.</p>
<p>The next one could be far more catastrophic — perhaps on par with the ongoing Taylor oil spill, which began in September 2004, after Hurricane Ivan ripped through the Gulf of Mexico and triggered submarine mudslides that toppled a Taylor Energy platform 11 miles off the coast of Louisiana. At least 25 wells were damaged, and oil has been leaking from the site for the last 15 years. A federal government study published in June 2019 and coauthored by McDonald estimated that as much as 4,500 gallons of oil is leaking from the site each day ― a figure orders of magnitude higher than Taylor’s estimates.</p>
<p>McDonald warned this could be the future of deep ocean oil spills. Subsea landslides are not unusual in the Gulf of Mexico, and are often the result of earthquakes. More than 50 percent of the oil produced in the Gulf is from platforms at depths greater than 1,000 meters, McDonald said.</p>
<p>“I would submit that the worst case scenario for a future oil spill is not loss of exploration well drilling, but the catastrophic destruction of a production platform in deep water,” McDonald said. “If a mudflow were to destroy one without warning, we could get a discharge of oil that could continue for years.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Whether it's pandemics or climate change, models help us avoid the worst.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a few weeks ago, researchers at Imperial College London released a model of the coronavirus pandemic that shocked policymakers into action. It <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf">predicted a staggering 2.2 million deaths</a> from COVID-19 in the U.S., and up to 510,000 in the U.K. &#8212; causing both countries to abruptly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/world/europe/coronavirus-imperial-college-johnson.html">change course</a> on containing the outbreak.</p>
<p>U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who had said that he wanted to allow the virus to spread through the country to build “herd immunity,” instituted a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/uk/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-gbr-intl/index.html">nationwide stay-at-home order</a>. President Trump also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/podcasts/coronavirus-trump-united-states.html">changed direction</a>, switching from calling it a hoax one week to saying “every one of us has a critical role” to play in slowing the disease.</p>
<p>But 10 days after the report’s release, the epidemiologist who led the modeling effort, Neil Ferguson, appeared before the U.K. parliament, arguing that he now expected the country’s fatalities to be less <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2238578-uk-has-enough-intensive-care-units-for-coronavirus-expert-predicts/">than 20,000</a>. (He didn’t touch on projections for the U.S.) Some saw this as a <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1243133211011690499">troubling reversal</a>. The conservative media outlet the <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/26/the-scientist-whose-doomsday-pandemic-model-predicted-armageddon-just-walked-back-the-apocalyptic-predictions/">Federalist</a> announced that Ferguson had retracted the findings of his “doomsday pandemic model.”</p>

<p>Models are simplified representations of reality and an often-maligned tool of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/no-senator-science-cant-do-away-with-models/">modern science</a>. Those that estimate how much greenhouse gases will heat up the planet have <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/07/26/heartlands-6-reasons-to-be-a-climate-change-skeptic-are-six-demonstrable-lies/#58f85ee26189">been attacked for years by deniers</a> who argue that they have little connection to the real world. In the face of a global pandemic, when lives and jobs are on the line, epidemiologists are suddenly facing <a href="https://grist.org/climate/misinformation-kills-the-link-between-coronavirus-conspiracies-and-climate-denial/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">the same criticism</a>. (Senator John Cornyn from Texas <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnCornyn/status/1248581686352318464">complained on Twitter</a> that modeling of both the current pandemic and climate change “isn’t the scientific method, folks.”)</p>
<p>Built using statistics and mathematics, scientific models can present possible futures &#8212; how a disease might spread, for example, or how rising CO2 levels will change our climate. But they can’t account for all aspects of reality, and will always come with uncertainty. They are tools, not crystal balls.</p>
<p>So those who criticized the Imperial College model for “wrongly” predicting millions of deaths in the U.S. and U.K. were off-base. Ferguson and his colleagues had <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-16-COVID19-Report-9.pdf">predicted</a> that over half a million Britons would die without mitigation measures &#8212; and that approximately 250,000 would die with the measures the government was implementing. With optimal social-distancing measures, which the U.K. put into place shortly after the report was released, the researchers expected deaths in the tens of thousands. (The Imperial College group did not model U.S. deaths with strict social-distancing measures.)</p>
<p>So the model didn’t change; the policies did. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/14/coronavirus-models-ihme-ic/">relying </a>on a model by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. That model initially projected between <a href="https://time.com/5813489/white-house-projects-100k-240k-deaths-coronavirus/">100,000 and 240,000 deaths</a> from the coronavirus &#8212; now, that estimate has been revised down to between <a href="https://time.com/5813489/white-house-projects-100k-240k-deaths-coronavirus/">30,000 and 170,000</a>. That’s because it incorporated new social distancing data from Spain and Italy, suggesting that lockdown measures could be more effective at slowing the spread in the United States than previously believed.</p>
<p>“I think in this pandemic it’s particularly difficult because we’re making assumptions in these models about human behaviors &#8212; which are incredibly difficult to capture in a model and put a single number to,” said Helen Jenkins, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Boston University. Most epidemiological models simulate the number of people who are susceptible, infected, and have recovered: <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-model-a-pandemic-134187">a so-called S-I-R model</a>. But that requires making estimates for how often people interact and how much social distancing they are doing &#8212; a difficult job in a country of 300 million people and 50 states pursuing slightly different lockdown strategies.</p>
<p>Researchers face similar hurdles when predicting climate change. On the one hand, they use easier-to-model processes like convection, heat and fluid transfer. But at some point they also have to incorporate human and group behavior, at least if they want to predict how greenhouse gas emissions might change in the future.</p>
<p>“You could have the very best physical model in the world, but if you get future human behavior wrong, you’d end up with a pretty bad future projection,” said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at the Breakthrough Institute. “The uncertainties in climate change to our choices as individuals and as societies matter just as much &#8212; if not more &#8212; than the uncertainties in the physical climate system that we’re trying to model.”</p>
<p>What makes the job even trickier is that once a projection is made public, the <em>model itself</em> can lead people to change their behaviors. If it projects millions of deaths from a pandemic, governments might tighten travel restrictions and people might decide to stay indoors. Zeynep Tufekci, associate professor at the University of North Carolina, wrote <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-models-arent-supposed-be-right/609271/">in the Atlantic</a> that this is part of what models are supposed to do. They present a range, or a “tree” of possibilities, some of which are so disastrous that immediate action should be taken to prevent them. By changing behavior, she argues, we can prune those “catastrophic branches” and direct governments towards a safer future.</p>
<p>Hausfather and other scientists argue that we have already trimmed one potentially catastrophic branch when it comes to climate change. Back in the mid-2000s, it seemed possible that “<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario">business-as-usual</a>” carbon emissions could lead to 5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100. China was in a rush to open coal plants, and it looked like coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, was on track to dominate for another century. Today, a “business-as-usual” approach <a href="https://grist.org/climate/that-dystopian-hellscape-keeping-you-up-at-night-its-less-likely-than-you-think/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">would likely lead to around 3 degrees Celsius of warming</a> &#8212; in part because world governments have begun cracking down on coal and boosting renewable energy.</p>
<p>“Even though it’s nowhere near the level of action that would be required to meet Paris commitments, it’s still enough to start ‘bending the curve’ away from these worst-case outcomes,” Hausfather said.</p>
<p>That’s part of why Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, has repeatedly said that appropriate action &#8212; in hindsight &#8212; will look like an overreaction. “If it looks like you’re overreacting, you’re probably doing the right thing,” he <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-dr-anthony-fauci-discusses-coronavirus-on-face-the-nation-march-15-2020/">told Margaret Brennan on Face the Nation</a>. Success can wind up looking like a failure.</p>
<p>What does that mean for addressing the pandemic? Social distancing appears to have helped the U.S. avoid the worst-case scenarios, but other questions remain. Researchers are now trying to understand which measures have been most effective (Closing schools? Limiting social gatherings?), so that some restrictions can be slowly lifted. But not every option can easily fit into epidemiological models. Public health officials and governors still have to use their own judgement, balancing health risks with other social and economic needs.</p>
<p>The German sociologist Ulrich Beck once wrote that “expected risks are the whip to keep the present in line.” Models are intended to do just that, to keep things from going off the rails. They can’t provide certainty &#8212; but for both climate change and coronavirus, they can help us avoid the worst.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[None of the passengers, tons of emissions: 'Ghost flights' are taking off all over the U.S.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Sorry for the long wait,” the TSA agent joked from behind his surgical mask. It was March 28, and I was the only person in the security line at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. I was trying to get home to San Jose, California, to quarantine with my recently widowed father. Sea-Tac was eerily, frighteningly quiet. When I got on an inter-terminal train, there were only two people on board &#8212; me and the pilot of my flight.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has frozen many Americans in place, and the fallout is hitting airlines hard. On Thursday, only around 95,000 passengers passed through TSA checkpoints, compared to 2.6 million on the same day last year: <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput">a drop of more than 96 percent</a>.</p>
<p>But even with most of the country staying home, the federal government is forcing planes to stay in the air. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, airlines are only eligible for their portion of the $25 billion aviation bailout that the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/business/coronavirus-airlines-bailout-treasury-department.html">recently negotiated</a> if they maintain “<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/03/31/coronavirus-stimulus-package-us-airlines-must-continue-flying/5093641002/">minimum service requirements</a>.”</p>

<p>That’s part of why, even though passenger numbers have plummeted, flights are still taking off all across the country. “The number of flights has only dropped something like 50 or 60 percent,” said Daniel Rutherford, program director for marine and aviation at the International Council on Clean Transportation. Flights that were once mostly full are now carrying a few passengers.</p>
<p>Other countries are flying markedly less. The commercial flight-tracking website <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/">Flightradar24</a> shows swarms of flights over the United States, while Europe has dramatically reduced its numbers of planes in the air.</p>
<p>The conditions of the federal bailout stipulate that if an airline flew a route at least once a day, five times a week before March 1, it must continue to do so during the pandemic &#8212; or request an exception.</p>
<p>At least nine airlines, including American, United, and Delta, have asked for exceptions so far, arguing that keeping planes in the air is neither “reasonable nor practical” during the current crisis. But the Department of Transportation has refused to grant most of them. On Thursday, the agency <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/04/15/bailed-out-airlines-seek-cut-routes-these-cities-during-covid-19/5139537002/">ordered Spirit Airlines to reinstate flights to 25 cities</a> or risk losing government aid.</p>
<p>Rutherford believes that the minimum service requirements are only part of the story behind why U.S. planes are still flying. Airlines have been slow to adapt to the drop in demand, and are still figuring out how to adapt to fewer flights and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/grounded-plane-storage-coronavirus/index.html">where to park</a> grounded aircraft. “By some analyses, airlines are still flying way more than they’re required to,” he said. “But I’m on the side that we don’t need a lot of these flights &#8212; and any government policy standing in the way of canceling them is a bad move.”</p>
<p>Flying is one of the most carbon-intensive actions an individual can take, and aviation currently accounts for about <a href="https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-the-growth-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-commercial-aviation">3 percent</a> of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Democratic lawmakers had previously <a href="https://grist.org/politics/democrats-want-travel-industry-to-reduce-emissions-in-exchange-for-coronavirus-bailout/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">called for the airline bailout</a> to include provisions for lowering emissions from the aviation industry; in the end, however, the money came with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/business/coronavirus-airlines-bailout-treasury-department.html">no climate strings attached</a>.</p>
<p>Future stimulus plans could still encourage more environmentally friendly policies. The government could attach future funding to requirements that domestic flights offset climate-warming emissions &#8212; or the EPA could, at long last, announce greenhouse gas emissions standards for aviation.</p>
<p>Those policy changes will be all the more important as aviation rebounds post-pandemic. Rutherford thinks that, once the worst of the outbreak has passed, people will be excited to travel again. “History has shown that leisure travel rebounds pretty quickly,” he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Five Fixers weigh in on the state of our food system, during and after the coronavirus pandemic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From restaurant closures to empty grocery-store shelves, it’s obvious that the food system has been taking a hit in the new global reality of COVID-19. This pandemic has exposed the fact that many of our country’s food supply-chain workers have <a href="https://www.eater.com/2020/3/16/21182291/restaurants-wont-survive-coronavirus-pandemic-without-bail-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zilch in the way of a safety net</a>. Meanwhile, without schools and restaurants to supply to, many farms are <a href="https://grist.org/food/coronavirus-myth-busting-the-truth-about-empty-shelves-and-toilet-paper-shortages/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having trouble pivoting to new markets</a>, while many farmworkers <a href="https://grist.org/justice/farmworkers-are-risking-their-lives-to-feed-a-nation-on-lockdown/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack basic protections</a> to carry out their essential work. Put simply: It’s a mess.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also bright spots. Acclaimed chefs like José Andrés of World Central Kitchen are <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/03/how-the-coronavirus-outbreak-has-the-worlds-chefs-springing-into-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing thousands of free or low-cost meals</a> for communities in need. Locals in places like the San Francisco Bay Area are <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/peninsula/half-moon-bay-seamstresses-team-up-to-make-masks-for-farm-workers/2271814/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sewing masks for nearby farmworkers</a>. And “<a href="https://crosscut.com/2020/03/wwii-era-victory-gardens-make-comeback-amid-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">victory gardens</a>” are starting to come back in vogue.</p>
<p>What’s still unclear is how the long-term economic fallout from the pandemic and subsequent shifts in <a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/consumer-trends/how-will-covid-19-crisis-change-consumer-dining-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumer behavior</a> will affect our many-tentacled food system in the months and years to come. So we went to the experts: chefs, farmers, food activists, rural community leaders, and academics.</p>
<p>Here’s what food-focused Fixers <a href="https://grist.org/grist-50/2020/#anthony-myint?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Anthony Myint</strong></a>, <a href="https://grist.org/grist-50/2020/#shane-bernardo?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Shane Bernardo</strong></a>, <a href="https://grist.org/grist-50/2020/#liz-carlisle?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Liz Carlisle</strong></a>, <a href="https://grist.org/grist-50/2019/#rey-leon?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Rey León</strong></a>, and <a href="https://grist.org/grist-50/2019/#leah-penniman?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leah Penniman</strong></a> had to say about how the pandemic is affecting us, from farm to table to community, and what the path forward might look like.</p>
<p><strong><em>The following responses have been edited for length and clarity.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<h3>Survival today, sustainability tomorrow</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-461279" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/myint-circle.png?w=200&#038;h=200" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/myint-circle.png?w=200&amp;h=200 200w, https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/myint-circle.png?w=400&amp;h=400 400w, https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/myint-circle.png?w=330&amp;h=330 330w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://grist.org/grist-50/2020/#anthony-myint?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Anthony Myint</strong></a>: <em>Chef, activist, and cofounder of Zero Foodprint in San Francisco</em></p>
<p>Let’s start with the bad news: COVID-19 has been devastating for our food system in general. Since so many workers on farms, at grocery stores, and at restaurants are low-income, the whole sector is disproportionately impacted. That represents a lot of people. One out of 10 workers in the U.S. are employed by restaurants and cafeterias, and that doesn&#8217;t even include farms and retail. Many small businesses will not have the savings or the kind of credit needed to reopen, and when things do reopen, there may not be anywhere near the traffic or revenue needed to sustain business.</p>
<p>So we expect there will definitely be a recession in the hospitality sector. But on the other hand, the restaurants that do survive may individually be better off — say, if demand falls 20 percent and supply falls 30 percent (because a lot of restaurants don&#8217;t reopen).</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a more important time than ever to talk about sustainability in the food system. But not the usual approach (eat less factory-farmed meat and waste less food). The new approach has to be around changing the way we farm and focusing on healthy soil, which would reduce the risk of fire, drought, flood, and chronic disease from nutrient deficiency, as well as conserve water, remove carbon from the atmosphere, and create better-tasting ingredients. It would be along the same lines as converting patches of the energy grid to renewables, only for acres of farmland.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Rethinking local food systems from the ground up</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-461276" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bernardo-circle.png?w=200&#038;h=200" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bernardo-circle.png?w=200&amp;h=200 200w, https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bernardo-circle.png?w=400&amp;h=400 400w, https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bernardo-circle.png?w=330&amp;h=330 330w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://grist.org/grist-50/2020/#shane-bernardo?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Shane Bernardo</strong></a>: <em>Cofounder of Food as Healing in Detroit</em></p>
<p>This pandemic has exposed the precariousness of our relationship to an extractive, market-based economy that relies on the exploitation of our labor and our planet. For instance, food workers in the gig economy have been left to fend for themselves working jobs that pay them low wages with little to no benefits to protect them. These are frontline workers! They have become critical to our survival because of our dependence on a system that extracts as much profit as it can by exploiting its workforce and our natural resources.</p>
<p>The best way we can address food insecurity and address long-term consequences of the pandemic is by creating hyper-local responses that are rooted in mutual aid, collaboration, and a sense of shared risk and autonomy. We need to think in broader, holistic terms that don&#8217;t recreate the violence of the industrial food system. We have an opportunity to create a paradigm shift right in our own neighborhoods, and it all starts within ourselves, our relationships with one another and the land.</p>
<p>My work around growing food, healing, and cultural organizing has become even more prominent as the need for physical, emotional, and spiritual sustenance has increased along with the level of anxiety and uncertainty that this pandemic and its mismanagement has brought on. I tend to focus on growing food as a way of building and maintaining relationships with the Earth and people around me in my community. It&#8217;s within these connections that we start to feel stable, safe, and whole.</p>
<hr />
<h3>An opportunity to invest in a more sustainable food economy</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-461277" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/carlisle-circle.png?w=200&#038;h=200" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/carlisle-circle.png?w=200&amp;h=200 200w, https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/carlisle-circle.png?w=400&amp;h=400 400w, https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/carlisle-circle.png?w=330&amp;h=330 330w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://grist.org/grist-50/2020/#liz-carlisle?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Liz Carlisle</strong></a>:<em> Assistant professor in the Environmental Studies Program at University of California, Santa Barbara</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s very clear right now that we are making a public choice about what kind of economy we&#8217;re going to invest in. This is a chance to invest in an economic stimulus and economic recovery that is equitable and sustainable from its very root. Are we going to bail out large, concentrated supermarket chains? Or are we going to really invest in the viability of small farms, agroecological practices, networks of small businesses, and regional food economies? We have that opportunity now — when we&#8217;re just kind of fighting over incremental amounts of funding in a typical cycle of year-to-year legislative process, we tend to be looking more at nickels and dimes. Now we&#8217;re really looking at trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>In terms of what happens next, there&#8217;s a huge spectrum of possibility here. We could become more vulnerable to future shocks if we don&#8217;t learn these lessons. And there is the potential for even deeper concentration in our food system if small, family-run restaurants close — because the restaurants that are best positioned to survive are large chains that have these store houses of capital. That’s something of great concern.</p>
<p>On the positive side, we might see an acknowledgement, now that farmworkers and grocery-store workers have been formally declared essential workers in this time of coronavirus. These are workforces that have been left out of bedrock labor legislation since the New Deal. Perhaps going forward, we will actually come to see these workforces as essential, and we&#8217;ll treat them as such.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Growing appreciation for where food comes from</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-461278" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/leon-circle.png?w=200&#038;h=200" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/leon-circle.png?w=200&amp;h=200 200w, https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/leon-circle.png?w=400&amp;h=400 400w, https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/leon-circle.png?w=330&amp;h=330 330w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://grist.org/grist-50/2019/#rey-leon?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Rey León</strong></a>: <em>Mayor of Huron, California</em></p>
<p>I live in a tiny farming town where 98 percent of residents are Latino and 44 percent live in poverty. What I’ve noticed is that farmworkers don’t have masks here. It would be great if their employers could provide them with personal protective equipment as they continue performing their essential duties necessary to feed the country. I would really love to see the farmworkers being protected, being provided with the appropriate equipment. That doesn&#8217;t seem to be happening right now.</p>
<p>That being said, it’s important that non-farming communities are now thinking about where their food comes from as a result of the pandemic. Some people seem to be thinking about how to be more independent in the way they eat — after all, depending on meat from across the country is showing to not be so resilient, not so sustainable. Maybe nature wants us to kind of step away from so much milk and so much meat, and eat more veggies and probably plant our own gardens.</p>
<p>Our communities, I think, should take the lesson on this one, to grow a network of community gardens where we can start learning how to be more resilient in times like this. I hope that this experience gets us more on that route, and not on the route of conspiracy and fear and mistrust.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Drawing on our roots, planting justice</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-461280" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/penniman-circle.png?w=200&#038;h=200" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/penniman-circle.png?w=200&amp;h=200 200w, https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/penniman-circle.png?w=400&amp;h=400 400w, https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/penniman-circle.png?w=330&amp;h=330 330w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://grist.org/grist-50/2019/#leah-penniman?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leah Penniman</strong></a>: <em>Farm manager and codirector of Soul Fire Farm in Petersburg, New York</em></p>
<p>(Contributions from the whole Soul Fire Farm team, including Lytisha Wyatt and Larisa Jacobson, are below.)</p>
<p>At Soul Fire Farm we believe that “to free ourselves we must feed ourselves,” and the challenges the COVID-19 outbreak is posing to our communities exemplify the need for collective food sovereignty.</p>
<p>The stakes are high: Before, during, and after the outbreak, food apartheid continues, and will continue, to disproportionately impact black, indigenous, and people-of-color communities that  also face higher vulnerability to COVID-19 due to factors like shared housing, lack of access to health care, environmental racism, job layoffs, immigration status, employment in the wage economy without worker protections, and more. The emergency food system is struggling to keep up with increased demand as more people experience loss of income, while food banks and food pantries are receiving fewer donations from grocery stores. Individuals and families who are limited to WIC and SNAP-designated food purchases — and do not have the space or financial resources to stockpile food — may be experiencing more acute food insecurity. Folks who rely on free- and reduced-lunch programs are also at risk with schools and other institutions closed indefinitely.</p>
<p>But there are steps we can take to help. In addition to systems and policy change, home and community gardening can help fill gaps in food access while bolstering longer-term community food sovereignty. Black, indigenous, and people-of-color-led organizations and communities have a rich history of growing food through provision gardens — we see this work as a continuation of that legacy.</p>
<p>To meet some of the needs of our community members we are offering materials, labor, and guidance to support folks in establishing upwards of 34 raised-bed gardens this spring. We’ve been collaborating with Northeast Farmers of Color Land Trust, Black Farmer Fund, HEAL Food Alliance, and the Castanea Fellowship to host bimonthly virtual skill-shares. These meetings catalyzed the creation of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B66EvxSza8_zPdEqF0rYUXGJqA5vRBCqu7zPPPDRQlw/edit#gid=821769033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Food &amp; Land Sovereignty Resource List for COVID-19</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the middle of a pandemic, the landmark anniversary is getting a digital makeover.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Picture the biggest protest you’ve ever seen. Crowds stretch on for miles between downtown skyscrapers on streets normally bustling with cars. From a birds-eye view, the moving bodies form a glittering mosaic. Zoom in, and the mass of chanting people brims with bright signs and unmistakable enthusiasm.</p>
<p>That scene can only happen in our imaginations for now. A march was part the original plan for Earth Day’s 50th anniversary this week, planned in tandem with the March for Science NYC, along with workshops, talks, live concerts, and more. But in the middle of a pandemic, few things are proceeding as planned. And so like everything else these days, the Earth Day happenings are going digital. The events are <a href="http://www.earthdayinitiative.org/virtual-kick-off">kicking off on Sunday with a livestream</a> featuring Senator Elizabeth Warren, the actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, leading up to Earth Day on April 22.</p>
<p>So what would success look like for a movement that’s previously relied on taking to the streets to galvanize people? The answer is pretty much the same for a splashy in-person protest. For lasting political change, it’s <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/12/climate-change-is-finally-having-a-political-moment-thats-no-accident/">what happens afterward</a> that matters &#8212; whether people stay involved and committed to the cause.</p>

<p>“The goal of these virtual events is to not let this landmark anniversary pass us by,” said John Opperman, executive director of the Earth Day Initiative, the organization that plans the annual events. Opperman said recent years have brought new energy and new faces to the climate movement, with the rise of the Youth Climate Strikes and the talk of a Green New Deal. The important thing, Opperman says, is that this momentum around climate action doesn’t get eclipsed by coronavirus.</p>
<p>Moving online means different challenges. There’s the potential loss of the excitement of attending a live event, with music blaring and banners streaming. Protests are often judged by the crowds, but there won’t be any. To make matters more complicated, some environmentalists think the day has <a href="https://grist.org/article/love-it-or-hate-it-earth-days-just-not-what-it-used-to-be-what-happened/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">lost its edge</a> over the decades, saying that it’s been taken over as a marketing opportunity by companies and puts the focus on <a href="https://grist.org/climate/how-people-came-to-believe-that-individual-choices-could-save-the-earth/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">personal habits</a> like bringing tote bags to grocery stores.</p>
<p>With the pandemic looming, the situation is reminiscent of the first Earth Day. On April 22, 1970, an estimated 20 million Americans &#8212; 10 percent of the country’s population &#8212; took to the streets, demanding that political leaders clean up our environment. They were responding to the mess they saw around them: thick smog, oil spills, and trashed rivers. A week later, President Richard Nixon invaded Cambodia during the Vietnam War. The headlines were taken over by the escalating conflict in Southeast Asia and anti-war protests, wrote Denis Hayes, the national organizer of the first Earth Day, in a recent editorial in <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/in-2020-earth-day-will-be-nov-3/">the Seattle Times</a>.</p>
<p>What propelled the movement back then, Hayes wrote, was an enduring campaign to get some of the most anti-environment politicians out of Congress &#8212; the so-called “Dirty Dozen.” Voters ended up kicking seven of these incumbents out of office in the 1970 election, including former Representative <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/earth-days-unsung-hero">George Fallon</a> of Maryland, chair of the House Public Works Committee, and that victory sent a message to legislators.</p>
<p>The importance of the upcoming presidential election is not lost on Earth Day 50’s organizers. The March for Science has been running a <a href="https://www.researchamerica.org/news-events/newsletter/vote-science">get-out-the-vote campaign</a> since 2017, and that’s continuing into the election this fall, said Ingrid Paredes, co-chair of March for Science NYC. She’s hoping that this year&#8217;s online events can reach new people and help them get involved with the broader movement, learning the merits of voting for science-based policy along the way. Polls suggest voters are getting more climate-conscious. <a href="https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/documents/report-exploration-us-voting-behavior-attitudes.pdf">In a survey</a> at the end of last year, 14 percent of registered voters said addressing climate change was their top priority, compared to just 2 to 6 percent a few years earlier.</p>
<p>To complement the livestream for Earth Day 50, the organizers have developed an app that lets participants interact. They can discuss different issues in threads, engage with speakers, and go to a virtual exhibit booth. The app will stick around for a year after the event. “It’s really a chance for people to get engaged in action, beyond just learning about climate and climate action the day of,” Paredes said.</p>
<p>Opperman sees another parallel between the current moment and the original Earth Day. Leading up to 1970, people were already geared up from Vietnam War protests and the Civil Rights movement. They understood the environmental threats they faced thanks to books like Rachel Carson’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/27/books/silent-spring-20-years-a-milestone.html">best-seller</a> <em>Silent Spring</em>, published in 1962. The environmental catastrophes that happened in 1969 &#8212; an <a href="https://psmag.com/news/the-ocean-is-boiling-the-complete-oral-history-of-the-1969-santa-barbara-oil-spill">oil-drilling accident</a> in Santa Barbara and a <a href="http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Cuyahoga_River_Fire">full-fledged fire</a> on Ohio’s Cuyahoga River &#8212; were the wake-up call.</p>
<p>Today, political involvement is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-enthusiasm-exclusive/exclusive-ahead-of-2020-election-a-blue-wave-is-rising-in-the-cities-polling-analysis-shows-idUSKBN20D1EG">on the rise</a>, and the devastating effects of climate change are right in front of us, showing up in the form of intense wildfires, long droughts, and supercharged hurricanes.</p>
<p>“To me,” Opperman said, “it looks like such a perfect storm moment, really similar to that perfect storm that existed around that first Earth Day in 1970.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Markets are emerging to pay farmers to store more carbon in the soil by using improved agricultural practices.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This</em> <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/can-carbon-smart-farming-play-a-key-role-in-the-climate-fight"><em>story</em></a> <em>was originally published by <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/">Yale Environment 360</a> </em><em>and is reproduced here as part of the</em> <a href="http://climatedesk.org/"><em>Climate Desk</em></a> <em>collaboration.</em></p>
<p>Trey Hill led a small group of fellow farmers to a field outside his office in Rock Hall on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. It was a cloudy February day, but the ground was alive with color — purple and red turnip tops mixing exuberantly with green rye, vetch, and clover, and beneath it all, rich brown soil. Hill reached down, yanked a long, thick, white daikon radish from the earth and showed his visitors sumptuous coffee-colored clods clinging to hairy rootlets. Those clumps, he explained, hoard carbon — carbon that’s not heating the planet.</p>
<p>Hill didn’t adopt “carbon-smart” practices like cover-cropping to fight climate change. He did it to build soil, retain water, and make money. But when the <a href="https://www.harborviewfarms.net/">third-generation corn, wheat, and soybean farmer</a> learned about Nori, a Seattle-based startup looking to sell credits for carbon stored in the soils of farms like his, he was all in. Hill didn’t necessarily expect a windfall, but he wanted to show fellow farmers they could make money while helping fight climate change. “If it works out and we make some money on it, that’s great,” Hill says. “If it doesn’t, well, somebody’s got to be first, and we’re willing to take that risk.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Nori paid Hill $115,000 for just over 8,000 tons of carbon stored in Hill’s soil. In the future, if each of the 10,000 acres he farms can sock away an additional ton of carbon per year — around the best he could hope for, he says — he could earn up to $150,000 annually.</p>
<p>As efforts to wean society off fossil fuels have stalled, “natural climate solutions” such as soil carbon sequestration have rapidly gained steam. In 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine reported that “negative emissions technologies” — techniques for removing carbon from the atmosphere, rather than simply reducing new emissions of carbon — are needed to stabilize global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the level scientists believe could be catastrophic.</p>
<p>The Academies’ report identified soil sequestration as a cost-effective and readily available climate solution, with the potential to remove 250 million metric tons or more of carbon dioxide per year in the United States alone. That’s about 5 percent of the United States’ annual CO2 emissions, which totaled <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/energy-related-co2-emissions-flatlined-last-year-iea-says.html">5.4 billion tons in 2018.</a> This month, a team led by researchers at The Nature Conservancy (TNC) estimated that if implemented globally, soil conservation and soil-building activities could provide <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0491-z">nearly 10 percent of the carbon reduction needed</a> to avoid breaching the 2-degree barrier.</p>
<p>Millions of dollars are now pouring into soil-climate initiatives from corporations like Microsoft and General Mills, philanthropists like Leonardo DiCaprio, and governments large and small. A Boston-based agricultural technology firm, <a href="https://www.indigoag.com/">Indigo Ag</a>, says that thousands of farmers working more than 18 million acres of farmland, nearly all in the U.S., have expressed interest in enrolling in its carbon-sequestration program. A consortium of food giants and nonprofits like TNC has raised more than $20 million to build a marketplace to sell soil carbon credits. Cities such as Boulder, Colorado and San Francisco are including soil carbon storage in their climate action plans. California already pays some farmers for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, and Maryland legislators are considering new funding for “carbon-smart” farmers like Hill.</p>
<p>At the national level, U.S. Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, Representative Deb Haaland, a New Mexico Democrat, and Representative Chellie Pingree, a Maine Democrat, have introduced bills that would pay farmers to adopt climate-friendly practices. Even Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue has endorsed the concept.</p>
<p>But a growing number of scientists worry that mounting societal pressure to <em>do something</em> to counter climate change is pushing money into so-called carbon farming before the science needed to underpin it is mature. New studies reveal that even long-accepted carbon sequestration practices may not yield hoped-for climate benefits. Measurements of soil at depths down to 2 meters have cast serious doubt on the climate impact of reducing soil tillage, and similar studies are now questioning how much carbon cover crops can sequester in some circumstances. A massive ramp-up of soil carbon data from working farms is urgently needed, experts say.</p>
<p>Even some supporters want to rein in the hype.</p>
<p>“We’re in a period of carbon exuberance,” says Philip Taylor, an ecologist and cofounder of the Boulder-based regenerative agriculture organization <a href="https://www.madagriculture.org/">Mad Agriculture</a>. “Society’s hope and wish that agriculture will solve climate change is overstated.”</p>
<hr />
<p>From when the first plow broke ground, agriculture has emitted carbon dioxide. Turning topsoil mixes underground carbon-containing molecules with atmospheric oxygen, creating the greenhouse gas that, more than any other, is imperiling civilization. Recent estimates suggest that some 133 billion tons of carbon, roughly a fourth of all carbon emitted by humans since the Industrial Revolution, has been lost from soils globally.</p>
<p>Technological advances have dramatically upped farming’s emissions in the last century. Fossil fuel use by the food system, including fuel for tractors and transport and energy for fertilizer production, now accounts for more than 10 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions. Fertilizer added to soils can cause microbes to emit nitrous oxide, or N2O, a greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide per molecule. N2O is now responsible for around 6 percent of global warming, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>But there is hope that such trends could be reversed. In 2004, Rattan Lal, a soil scientist at Ohio State University, estimated that changes in farming and soil management practices could, in theory, coax up to two-thirds of all carbon lost from soils back underground, potentially drawing down atmospheric carbon dioxide considerably. Lal and others recommended practices shown to increase the fraction of carbon-containing compounds in upper soil layers, including reducing or eliminating tillage that exposes soil carbon to air, mulching fields with crop residues, and planting cover crops — cereals, legumes, or other vegetables grown not for harvest but to reduce erosion and enrich soil with nutrients and carbon-rich organic matter.</p>
<p>Some farmers, it turns out, were already adopting such practices. The United States&#8217; no-till movement began in the 1940s, when soil conservation became a priority after plowing of arid Western land sparked the ruinous Dust Bowl, and newly available herbicides allowed farmers to kill weeds without turning soil. More than a third of U.S. cropland is now farmed without tillage, and another third is under so-called low-till management, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) statistics.</p>

<p>Cover crops have also gained steam, though more slowly. In 1992, to reduce pollution into the Chesapeake Bay, the state of Maryland began paying farmers to plant cover crops on bare fields. Hill, despite being skeptical that he would benefit, was an early adopter. “It had nothing to do with climate or soil health,” Hill says. “All of us thought it was a bunch of environmental BS … Then we found that it works and saw that the soil started to change.” Where Hill grew cover crops, his soils eroded less and held more water.</p>
<p>Maryland now boasts the nation’s highest cover-cropping rate. Cutting-edge farmers like Hill have graduated from single-species plantings to diverse mixtures like the one he showed off in February, which provide not just erosion and runoff reduction but also nitrogen fixation and food for pollinating insects. The practice is starting to catch on widely, with a 50 percent increase in nationwide cover-cropping rates from 2012 to 2017.</p>
<p>The idea of paying farmers for actually drawing down carbon, however, has not taken off. No one knew how to accurately, yet affordably, measure the small, slow changes in soil carbon that might accrue over one or even multiple growing seasons. The gold standard for soil carbon measurement involves extracting multiple cylindrical cores from a field, drying them, combusting them in an oven, and measuring the carbon dioxide released — a time-consuming and expensive process.</p>
<p>Technology has finally started to catch up with ambition. Hill, like many farmers, now uses software that logs rivers of data about his farming practices — every time he drives a field, sprays a chemical, or plants a crop — into a software program called Granular, which helps him fine-tune his inputs and decision making. The same data, scientists realized, can be used to estimate a farm’s carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission rates.</p>
<p>Granular staff connected Hill with Nori, a startup company launched in 2017 by idealistic young environmentalists looking to use tech to bring down the costs of compensating farmers for carbon sequestration. Nori staff thought Hill’s Granular data could help crack the carbon measurement problem. What followed was an educational process for both sides. Nori’s founders weren’t familiar with the subtleties of conservation tillage. Hill didn’t know much about blockchain, the theoretically secure, bank-free technology that Nori wanted to use to funnel payments to farmers from carbon-dioxide emitters seeking offsets.</p>
<p>After two years of conversation, Nori decided to sell credits based on five years’ worth of Hill’s carbon-sequestering practices, from 2014 to 2018. Nori would calculate Hill’s climate impact using COMET-Farm, a digital tool produced by the USDA. COMET-Farm takes in farming practice information from platforms like Granular, mixes it with weather data from satellites and sensors and soil information from USDA databases, and uses sophisticated computer models to estimate how quickly carbon builds up in soils and greenhouse gases escape.</p>
<p>By not requiring a site visit or soil samples, which can run thousands of dollars, Nori kept verification costs low. The verification process cost Hill around $3,500, though he will need to pay for an audit in 10 years to confirm that carbon was actually stored.</p>
<p>On October 7, Nori offered Hill’s credits for $16.50 per ton, with $1.50 going to Nori and $15 to Hill. A total of 342 buyers purchased 8,010 tons’ worth of credits out of 14,011 offered, according to <a href="https://nori.com/supplier/1">Nori</a>. Available on the company’s website are satellite images of Hill’s fields along with the number of credits sold against each and even the names of some buyers, which included individuals looking to buy just a credit or two; companies such as the travel company BootsnAll, whose leaders wanted to reduce their firm’s carbon footprint; and institutions like Arizona State University and <a href="http://schwarzenegger.usc.edu/institute-in-action/article/the-schwarzenegger-institute-offsets-carbon-emissions-with-nori-carbon-remo">the University of Southern California’s Schwarzenegger Institute</a>.</p>
<p>That radical transparency is what sets apart Nori’s program for Hill. He now has blockchain-certified evidence that his crops are grown using climate-friendly methods, which he hopes will help him sell wheat and soybeans for a premium, perhaps to affluent, climate-conscious consumers in the nearby Washington, D.C. area. And he’s investing the money into making his operation even more sustainable. He just ordered a piece of equipment called a roller-crimper that kills cover crops without chemicals and plants a cash crop in the same field pass. Hill says the new machine will enable him to spray less herbicide and drive his fields fewer times in a season, racking up additional gains that will support further sales through Nori.</p>
<p>Despite the strong launch, Nori’s success is not assured. When I spoke with Christophe Jospe, Nori’s chief development officer, in December, he hoped to sell 100,000 tons’ worth of credits by the end of the first quarter of 2020, but to date the company has not held another sale; Jospe now says more than 150 farmers representing more than 500,000 acres are working through the verification process, with the plan to sell their credits later this year.</p>
<p>Competitors are close on Nori’s heels. Last June, Indigo Ag announced that it would open a carbon market. The company will publish its monitoring and verification methods this spring and hopes to sell credits by the end of the year. A third organization, the Ecosystem Services Market Consortium, will target corporate, municipal, and other large buyers, offering credits for carbon sequestration as well as water quality and avoided runoff. The marketplace is piloting its program on 50,000 acres of farmland and has announced a nationwide target launch date of 2022.</p>
<p>With legislation that would provide incentives to adopt regenerative agriculture techniques under consideration in both chambers of Congress, farmers may soon have even more ways to get paid for fighting climate change. Things are happening internationally as well. Australia and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan have paid farmers for soil carbon sequestration, and the French government in 2015 launched the “<a href="https://www.4p1000.org/">4 per 1000</a>” initiative to increase soil carbon stocks by 0.4 percent per year.</p>
<p>“There’s very strong momentum,” says Lal. “I’m very impressed with what is happening.”</p>
<hr />
<p>A growing number of scientists, however, are not as impressed as they’d like to be with the science underpinning the soil carbon sequestration gold rush.</p>
<p>In 2006, USDA soil scientist John Baker analyzed studies that had measured the effects of no-till on carbon through 1-meter-deep soil samples. Historically, most studies have measured only the top 20 or 30 centimeters (8 to 12 inches) — the so-called plow layer — and found carbon building up there. The few studies that went deeper, however, often found that a roughly equal amount of carbon disappeared in the layers below 30 centimeters. No-till appeared to change the vertical distribution of carbon rather than the total amount sequestered, Baker and colleagues <a href="https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/10042/PDF">reported</a>. More recent papers have confirmed Baker’s findings.</p>
<p>Cover crops have maintained a stronger reputation as a climate solution. The TNC study published this month estimated that if farmers around the globe adopted the practice, they could take up nearly half-a-billion tons of carbon dioxide annually.</p>
<p>But the study, like most others to date, relied on measurements made mainly in the plow layer. Recent deep-soil studies have questioned cover crops’ climate benefits. In a 10-year experiment that sampled down to 1 meter, soil scientists at Iowa State University found that deep-rooted perennials and cover crops revved up soil microbes that released much of the crops’ deposited carbon back into the atmosphere. “Simply adding more carbon in doesn’t necessarily mean that carbon is going to stay there,” says study coauthor Steven Hall.</p>
<p>University of California Davis researchers, in a 19-year study that measured down to 2 meters’ depth, found that cover-cropping alone didn’t add carbon, unless supplemented by compost, which can be expensive. “It was really surprising to us,” Nicole Tautges, the study lead, says. “The way we see it, at least in our semi-arid Mediterranean production context, cover crops don’t seem to be doing what people say they do.”</p>
<p>Still other studies have found that increasing soil carbon can, in some cases, supercharge soil microbes that consume nitrogen and emit the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, potentially offsetting carbon sequestration’s climate benefits unless nitrogen fertilizers are carefully managed.</p>
<p>Studies questioning soil carbon sequestration’s benefits, however, are often conducted at long-term university or government research plots, which do not necessarily replicate the many and various management decisions made on real-world farms, experts say. “The papers that go against the initiative I think have as many holes as the papers that argue that you can do it,” says Mark Bradford, a soil scientist at the Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies.</p>
<p>COMET-Farm, the tool Nori relies on, reflects both the promise and the limitations of today’s soil science. It is based largely on computer models that the U.S. uses to annually report agriculture-related greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations. Numerous people, including Bradford, say these models — validated by data gathered from more than 100 research sites — are among the best attempts to simulate soil’s complex chemistry and biology.</p>
<p>But even 100 sites capture only a tiny sample of the 300,000 known soil types and the thousands of decisions a farmer could make over a career’s worth of growing seasons. COMET-Farm also essentially punts on the deep soil question, considering only changes in carbon in the upper 30 centimeters of the soil.</p>
<p>For William Schlesinger, president emeritus of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York, who has <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.14478">strongly questioned</a> whether soil carbon sequestration can fight climate change, ignoring the subsoil is a potentially fatal flaw for emerging carbon markets. “Before payments were achieved, I’d want to see somebody having sampled down to 1 meter depth, and only pay for the net total accumulation, if any,” Schlesinger says.</p>
<p>Keith Paustian, a soil ecologist at Colorado State University who leads the development of COMET-Farm, says his team will soon publish statistical uncertainty estimates for the model’s predictions, which will aid Nori and other users. But he thinks the science is already robust enough to support carbon markets. “We’ve got a pretty solid empirical base from decades of soil science and field measurements,” Paustian says. “I definitely think that we know enough to move forward.”</p>
<p>Last year, Bradford assembled a group of researchers from academia and conservation to assess whether available science supported soil-based climate solutions. In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0431-y">a paper in Nature Sustainability</a>, the authors agreed that regenerative agriculture practices can sequester carbon. But they acknowledged that existing methods cannot accurately measure how quickly that carbon accumulates on a particular farm. One of Bradford’s doctoral students is developing <a href="http://www.quickcarbon.org/">a handheld field scanner</a> to provide such measurements by correlating properties of light reflected off of soils with soil carbon content.</p>
<p>Bradford also calls for dedicated experiments to sample a far wider range of farms, growing practices, and soil types. He is advising Indigo Ag on such a project, the <a href="https://www.indigoag.com/for-researchers/the-terraton-experiment">Terraton Experiment</a>, that’s slated to run through at least 2029 and will support the company’s carbon market. The study has already sampled soils on tens of thousands of acres, some to a depth of 1 meter, and will ultimately compile the biggest dataset ever collected to assess the climate impact of farming practices, says Dan Harburg, Indigo’s senior director of systems innovation.</p>
<p>One participating farmer, Tom Cannon of Oklahoma, told me Indigo researchers visit his farm weekly to take soil samples and interview him about his practices. “It’s the most comprehensive amount of data anybody has asked me for,” he says.</p>
<p>Beyond scientific and measurement uncertainties, scientists also worry that simple biophysical limitations of soil carbon sequestration are being overlooked. USDA’s Baker notes how easy it is for carbon stored in topsoil to be released back to the atmosphere if, say, a farmer decides to till after years of no-till, or soil microbe respiration rates increase as the globe warms — something predicted by multiple studies. “You’re not locking carbon in a vault,” he says.</p>
<p>Additionally, notes Hanna Poffenbarger, a soil scientist at the University of Kentucky, no soil is a bottomless carbon sink. Even topsoil, where potential carbon gains are best documented, re-equilibrates to a stable carbon concentration after a few decades of no-till farming or cover cropping. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.14066">A 2018 review from researchers in the United Kingdom</a> noted that that is already happening in some places.</p>
<p>Everybody I spoke with agrees that regenerative agriculture is good for soil health and has important environmental benefits that may be worth paying for. Most believe that soils may have a role to play in drawing down carbon. But nearly all scientists also want more certainty before wholeheartedly endorsing fighting climate change using farming practices.</p>
<p>Says Baker: “To rely on those for real mitigation of climate change is, I think, a risky business.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/oakland-california-slow-streets-coronavirus-us"><em>story</em></a> <em>was originally published by <a href="http://theguardian.com">the Guardian</a> </em><em>and is reproduced here as part of the</em> <a href="http://climatedesk.org/"><em>Climate Desk</em></a> <em>collaboration.</em></p>
<p>With many residents working from home and children out of school, the city of Oakland, California, is closing off 74 miles of its streets to passing cars, making it easier for residents to run, bike, or play.</p>
<p>Oakland’s “slow streets” initiative, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zly0Z9FJ8E">announced on April 9</a> by Mayor Libby Schaaf, sets aside up to 10 percent of the city’s streets for recreation. Starting last weekend with four specific intersections, affected streets will be closed to thru-traffic. A list of street closures was <a href="https://www.oaklandca.gov/projects/oakland-slow-streets">published</a> by Oakland’s department of transportation.</p>

<p>“Because of the reduction in car traffic, we will be closing off a number of streets so that bicyclists and pedestrians can spread out and take in fresh air safely on Oakland streets, free of cars,” <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/10/coronavirus-oakland-banishes-cars-from-74-miles-of-city-streets/">Schaaf said</a>.</p>
<p>Like many Californians, Bay Area residents have flooded parks and local beaches since a shelter-in-place order took effect in mid-March, prompting officials to close parks to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>City officials hoped the slow streets initiative &#8212; which they are calling an emergency measure &#8212; would give residents a safe way to get outdoors for Easter weekend while<a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/09/coronavirus-san-jose-regional-parks-to-close-on-easter-weekend-to-avoid-crowding/"> area parks were restricted,</a> but Schaaf cautioned residents that the initiative does not mean public health guidance should be ignored.</p>
<p>“Social distancing is the only vaccine we have to fight this deadly virus,” Schaaf said.</p>
<p>The news was met with resounding applause from local transportation advocates.</p>

<p>Schaaf asked motorists to adhere to the restrictions and be extra mindful of children on the streets, reminding residents streets will still be open to local traffic. But Schaaf stopped short of enlisting police to enforce the restrictions.</p>
<p>“We will not be giving out, at this time, citations,” said the mayor, adding that people have enough to worry about amid a pandemic.</p>
<p>Roughly 11 percent of the city’s land is made up of 6,000 acres of parks — streets and sidewalks make up an additional 20 percent to 30 percent, said a city official, adding that the city wanted to take advantage of its space for the sunny holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The news was especially welcome in East Oakland, a neighborhood historically overlooked and impoverished, residents said at a press conference about the initiative on April 10. Many East Oakland residents continue to work, despite the shelter-in-place orders, said one community advocate, often walking to their jobs to do so. Any effort to make streets safer is good news for the community, he said.</p>
<p>“Some of us have to survive and we survive by working,” he said at the press conference. “Living in East Oakland, every day is an emergency.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It was bad enough when Super Typhoon Yutu struck my childhood home of Saipan. Now the coronavirus is reviving that trauma.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This essay was first published in our semi-weekly newsletter, Climate in the Time of Coronavirus, which you can subscribe to <a href="https://go.grist.org/signup/coronavirus?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>It’s like <a href="https://grist.org/article/a-year-ago-this-island-was-hit-with-the-worst-u-s-storm-since-1935-what-happened-next/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">Super Typhoon Yutu all over again</a>, but worse: the worry, the fear, the anxiety. The distance between my parents and me has never felt as vast as it does now, amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Growing up in Saipan, a remote U.S. territory in the Pacific, I dreamed that someday I’d move to the mainland. When the time came, at age 18, I packed my bags, kissed my family goodbye, and moved to Portland, Oregon, for college. They couldn’t come to drop me, because we didn’t have the money. Round-trip flights from the mainland to the Northern Mariana Islands ranged from $1,000 to $2,000 per person, so I rarely visited home. I knew my parents were happy for me, but I also knew they were worried about sending their first child off into the world alone.</p>

<p>The distance between my family and me stretched farther when I moved to New York City after graduating in 2018. A couple months later, Super Typhoon Yutu was barrelling toward my hometown. I was working at the Financial Times, and I could barely focus as I constantly refreshed my social media feeds for updates. Despite the 17-hour time difference, I was tormented by the silence in my family group chat. The last message I received before the storm was my dad saying, “I love you, we’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>Thankfully they survived the typhoon. <a href="https://grist.org/article/this-u-s-commonwealth-is-still-rebuilding-6-months-after-super-typhoon-yutu-made-landfall/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">But the trauma of being far away from home</a> never left me.</p>
<p>I’m still in New York, and my younger sister is in her first year of college in California. My parents are now alone. Super Typhoon Yutu was terrifying, but my anxiety is much worse this time around. This global pandemic piles panic and distress on top of the fear I remember feeling during that earlier crisis.</p>
<p>Video calls with my parents are the only thing keeping me sane. As the number of cases in New York surges each day, what they don’t realize is that I fear for them, now that they are stuck on an island with few resources. The difference between New York City and Saipan is substantial: One is the center of attention, while Saipan and other U.S. territories, like Guam, and Puerto Rico, are often second thoughts. So when the first few COVID cases were announced in the Northern Mariana Islands last month, my anxiety level shot through the roof.</p>
<p>Each time I press the red button to end our now-daily family video calls (with representatives from three different time zones), I remind myself that it’s okay to feel anxious. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. It’s okay to be scared. It’s okay to cry.</p>
<p>And in these chaotic times, I know I have to hold on to the hope that this storm, too, shall pass.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Half a million clean energy workers could lose their jobs by the end of June, according to a new analysis.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In early March, when COVID-19 cases began popping up across the U.S., the Philadelphia-based company Solar States was having a really good year, with at least six months’ worth of contracts already lined up. The <a href="https://www.solar-states.com">30-person company</a> installs solar panels on homes and commercial buildings and hosts workforce training programs for high school students and unemployed Philadelphians, often hiring its graduates.</p>
<p>The fallout happened fast. The first thing Solar States did was distribute masks and gloves to workers, company founder Micah Gold-Markel told Grist. But with the number of cases going up and guidance from officials changing on a daily basis, soon the company was holding a meeting every morning at 6:30 AM to check in with the staff and rearrange crews based on who was still comfortable going into houses. Eventually clients didn’t want workers coming inside at all. The company considered continuing with whatever external work they could do, but a lot of clients were financing their panels through loans that would not pay out until the entire project was complete.</p>
<p>“It was becoming a real logistical nightmare,” said Gold-Markel. By late March, there was no alternative — Solar States closed up shop.</p>

<p>Gold-Markel said he applied for a Paycheck Protection Program loan to be able to pay his employees through the crisis but hasn’t received anything yet. On Wednesday, the White House announced that funding for the program, which was part of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr748/BILLS-116hr748enr.pdf">$2 trillion economic relief act</a> passed less than two weeks ago, has already <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/04/16/congress-coronavirus-small-business-trump/">run out</a>.</p>
<p>This story is not unique to Solar States, of course. All kinds of companies and their employees across the country experienced a similar free fall last month, and now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/business/economy/unemployment-numbers-coronavirus.html">22 million Americans</a> have filed for unemployment. But the clean energy sector has been hit especially hard. Solar States’ 30 laid-off employees are among more than 106,000 clean energy workers who lost their jobs in March, according to a new <a href="https://e2.org/releases/106000-jobs-in-clean-energy-lost-in-march-due-to-covid-19-economic-crisis/">analysis</a> released on Wednesday. BW Research Partnership, which performed the analysis, projected that number will go up to 500,000 by the end of June.</p>
<p>According to E2, a clean energy advocacy group that commissioned the analysis, “<a href="https://e2.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/E2-Clean-Jobs-America-2020.pdf">clean energy</a>” is a vast sector that employed nearly 3.4 million Americans in 2019. It includes more than 2 million jobs in energy efficiency, like weatherizing houses and manufacturing Energy Star appliances; half a million jobs in renewable energy, including solar, wind, hydropower, and <a href="https://grist.org/energy/as-oil-crashes-americas-untapped-energy-giant-could-rise/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">geothermal</a>; more than 250,000 jobs building hybrid and electric vehicles; about 150,000 jobs in power grid modernization and installing energy storage for the grid; and another 40,000 jobs in biofuels like ethanol and biomass. In total, clean energy workers outnumbered fossil fuel workers <a href="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/0a84f-useer20200323.pdf">three to one</a> last year.</p>
<p>“It’s a huge and important part of our economy,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe told Grist. “Anything that Congress does to get our economy back on its feet and to get America working again should absolutely include a focus on an industry of that size.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once people begin to move freely again, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/">whenever that may be</a>, Keefe is concerned that spending money on energy efficiency retrofits and solar panels will not be at the top of anyone’s list of priorities. Advocates are calling on Congress not only to rescue clean energy firms in future recovery packages, but also to use the industry as an economic driver to help the country rebuild, <a href="https://t.co/TmRbymZ1G6?amp=1">as it did in 2009</a> with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.</p>
<p>In an updated version of its <a href="https://e2.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/E2-Clean-Jobs-America-2020.pdf">2020 Clean Jobs America report</a>, E2 outlines what such a package should include: a $30 to $90 billion program to upgrade transmission lines, improving grid resilience and preparing it for widespread renewable energy deployment; a program to build a national electric vehicle charging network; a building electrification program. The report also calls for increasing funding to various Department of Energy programs like job training and research and development.</p>
<p>Keefe believes some of these initiatives don’t need to wait until the threat of COVID-19 has passed. “Why can’t we get some of the 150,000 or so people who work in grid modernization at utilities and in energy storage out there upgrading our ancient power grid in America?” he said. “You can do some pretty good social distancing when you’re a couple hundred feet up on a power line somewhere.”</p>
<p>Advocates are also asking Congress to extend and expand federal clean energy investment tax credits. Gold-Markel of Solar States said this was hugely important. The company had promised clients it would get their projects done by the end of the year so they could take advantage of the 26 percent solar tax credit, which will be <a href="https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/658">downgraded to 22 percent</a> next year, and is set to expire entirely at the end of 2022. “It’s going to be a much different value proposition for the customer if they don’t get it,” he said, “and it’s going to put us in a sticky situation.”</p>
<p>Despite getting the rug pulled out from under his company, Gold-Markel thinks that in the long term, the solar industry will bounce back. “I think solar is inevitable. It is the way of the future,” he said. “I just don’t know whether this year we’ll recover right away, or it’s going to be next year, or the year after.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shortly after the EPA’s March 26 <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-03/documents/oecamemooncovid19implications.pdf">announcement</a> that it would relax enforcement of the country’s environmental protection laws due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a coalition of environmental groups <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/media/2020/200401">called on</a> the agency to publish an emergency rule. That rule would require polluters taking advantage of the relaxed standards to submit written notice to the EPA. The petition also called on the EPA to make that information public.</p>
<p>The groups say that the EPA ignored their request. Now, the coalition is taking the agency to court.</p>
<p>The Natural Resources Defense Council announced Thursday that it is suing the EPA on behalf of a coalition of nearly two dozen environmental justice, climate, and public interest groups. The coalition is asking the court to intervene and procure an EPA response to their petition proposing the emergency rule.</p>

<p>“EPA has refused our call to fix this reckless policy, so we’re taking them to court,” said Judy Robinson, executive director of Coming Clean, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. “That’s how serious it is for us.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/complaint-epa-non-enforcement-20200416.pdf">complaint</a>, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that the EPA’s enforcement discretion policy creates a serious and immediate risk that industrial facilities and others will halt the monitoring and reporting that constitutes compliance with statutory pollution limits. The policy applies to every industry, including chemical manufacturing and coal-fired power, and “virtually all other sources of pollution,” according to a press release announcing the lawsuit. The type enforcement that the EPA relaxed provides the public with information about hazardous air pollutants, toxic chemical releases, drinking water safety, and more.</p>
<p>“The policy poses a huge risk to public health, especially to downstream, downwind, and already overburdened communities — who, without timely information about air and water emissions, cannot protect themselves from being harmed,” the lawsuit states.</p>
<p>The EPA published its new enforcement discretion policy three days after receiving a letter from an oil industry trade group requesting a broad waiver of environmental rules during the pandemic, according to the lawsuit. Coming Clean’s Robinson contrasted this with the lack of response that the environmental groups received when they subsequently petitioned the EPA for a rule asking companies for written notice if they take advantage of the waiver.</p>
<p>“If you want a waiver, we want to know. And we want to know that you need one,” said Robinson. “Then we can follow up through other mechanisms to ensure that the facilities are not, in fact, putting communities that are already at risk at greater risk by not adhering to the pollution regulations that we currently have.”</p>
<p>An EPA spokesperson told Grist that, though the agency does not comment on pending litigation, the new policy is a lawful and proper exercise of the EPA’s authority under extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p>“As we’ve stated previously, contrary to reporting, EPA’s enforcement authority and responsibility remains active and the temporary guidance does not allow any increase in emissions,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. “This is not a nationwide waiver of environmental rules. We will continue to work with federal, state and tribal partners to ensure that facilities are meeting regulatory requirements, while taking appropriate steps to protect the health of our staff and the public.”</p>
<p>Michele Roberts, national co-coordinator for the Environmental Justice Health Alliance for Chemical Policy Reform, said in a statement that the Trump administration is using the novel coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to give a free pass to polluters.</p>
<p>“We will not let this outrageous order stand,” said Roberts, whose alliance aids grassroots organizations working in communities burdened by toxic chemicals, polluting facilities, and contaminated sites.</p>
<p>A 2018 <a href="https://ej4all.org/life-at-the-fenceline">study</a> of cumulative health hazards in vulnerable communities found that nearly 12,500 high-risk chemical facilities across the country place 39% of the U.S. population (124 million people) in constant risk of a chemical disaster. Communities of color and low-income residents face a disproportionate risk to their health and safety from these facilities, including threats from potential chemical releases or explosions and daily exposure to toxic air pollution. (The study was produced by Coming Clean, the Environmental Justice Health Alliance for Chemical Policy Reform, and the Campaign for Healthier Solutions, which works to phase out harmful chemicals in the products sold by discount retail stores.)</p>
<p>Many communities rely on data collected through the EPA’s regulatory process to hold industries accountable for pollution, contamination, and emissions, according to Jose Bravo, the executive director of the San Diego-based Just Transition Alliance, a national coalition of environmental justice organizations and labor unions, and also one of the plaintiffs in Thursday’s suit. This data includes everything from the type of chemicals a facility has on site to the amount of emissions produced by that facility.</p>
<p>“We would like to see the EPA do its job,” Bravo told Grist. “We would also like to see communities not have to worry about both COVID-19 and even stronger emissions because nobody is regulating those industries.”</p>
<p>While advocates like Robinson say the EPA’s reliance on self-reporting compliance data was an “honor system” that created problems even before the new discretionary policy, grassroots organizations are now concerned that the new policy could block the flow of vital information altogether for the duration of the crisis.</p>
<p>“[The EPA] absolved facilities of the requirement to act upon an honor system that really is insufficient, given what we know about the heightened pollution levels and the heightened disease rates and disparities that exist in communities that live on the fence line of these facilities,” said Robinson.</p>
<p>This policy change places an additional burden on residents in fence-line communities — so-called because they are located at or near the boundaries of industrial facilities — to step up their own monitoring efforts at a time when most have been ordered by local and state governments to shelter in place. Residents in these communities often rely on what they see, hear, and smell to track potential safety issues like chemical leaks, refinery explosions, fires, and other incidents that could endanger the health of themselves or their neighbors. The EPA’s new policy decision makes this on-the-ground monitoring more critical than ever, according to Robinson.</p>

<p>In Texas, a 52-mile stretch of land from Houston to Galveston is choked with refineries and chemical plants that Juan Parras has monitored for years. As the founder and executive director of Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services (t.e.j.a.s.), he and his organization have worked to provide residents with the tools to protect themselves and the environment through legal action, community awareness and education, and stronger government policies and regulations. The EPA’s decision is a step in the wrong direction for these communities, he said.</p>
<p>“It’s creating a very toxic zone for us,” Parras told Grist.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/YJ4LUsQ2wHU">Manchester</a>, a historically Latino neighborhood in Houston, residents are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/09/02/548076049/the-chemical-dangers-in-houston-s-manchester-neighborhood">exposed</a> to toxic air <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5036672/">pollutants</a> on a daily basis from more than a dozen industrial plants and facilities, said Parras. Industry is such an overwhelming presence that young children mistake smokestack emissions for clouds. Residents suffer from high rates of asthma, breathing disorders, and <a href="https://grist.org/article/the-newer-greener-houston-isnt-for-everybody/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">cancer,</a> including a cluster of childhood leukemia cases, according to Parras.</p>
<p>The effects of living in polluted neighborhoods like Manchester are cumulative, putting those with weak immune systems and underlying health conditions most at risk. This is why t.e.j.a.s. has worked to strengthen policies that control emissions of air toxins. Now that Texas Governor Greg Abbott has <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/31/greg-abbott-texas-executive-order-closures/">ordered</a> residents to stay at home and schools to remain closed until at least May 4, the coronavirus threat has created an added threat for these already-vulnerable residents.</p>
<p>“The children who generally go to school away from Manchester — now they’re having to stay at home on a daily basis, so [asthma] is a bigger threat to them,” said Parras.</p>
<p>Understanding how and if local industrial facilities are meeting federal environmental standards is important to residents in communities like these. And, according to Parras, it’s why t.e.j.a.s joined as a plaintiff in Thursday’s lawsuit.</p>
<p>“The EPA, in allowing this to happen, is basically going against its very core value, which is to protect human and human safety [against] industrial pollution,” said Parras. “So it’s already failing in its mission to address that. It’s not in the business of protecting industry. It&#8217;s in the business to protect communities and public health.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Eat your food, save the climate. Sort of.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="qa">Q.</span> <strong>Dear Umbra,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’ve never cooked at home much before this coronavirus stay-at-home order, and I keep finding groceries I bought three weeks ago and forgot about now rotting in the back of my fridge. Help! I need a system.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8212; Not Even Worrying ’Bout Impending Expiration</strong></p>
<p><span class="qa">A.</span> Dear NEWBIE,</p>
<p>Did you say … <em>system</em>? Yes!!!! Maybe it’s because the days are all melting into one another during the pandemic, but I think structure could benefit many right now. When there is nothing left to burn, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Or6-HOveg">as they say</a>, you have to set your fridge on fire. In the <em>metaphorical </em>sense! On fire with <em>ambition</em>!</p>
<p>Food waste is not just a <a href="https://grist.org/article/what-does-it-mean-to-take-responsibility-for-our-waste/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">personal pet peeve of mine</a>; it also represents a huge opportunity for carbon savings, according to the climate solutions rankings of the research organization Project Drawdown. While <a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/reduced-food-waste/technical-summary">a lot of that potential savings</a> would come from large-scale reforms like better agricultural storage, more effective large-scale waste prevention tactics pushed by corporations, or more expansive municipal composting infrastructure, consumer-level carelessness still represents an <a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/reduced-food-waste">estimated 35 percent of food waste</a> in wealthy economies (like the United States). In other words: Eat your food, save the climate. Sort of.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons that food gets wasted at home; the demands of modern culture (Work! Family! Demise of society!) can take up significant brain space to the detriment of, say, home organization. That’s not necessarily a bad thing! But modern culture has changed a lot, very suddenly, in the past several weeks as we attempt to quell the coronavirus pandemic. Suddenly many of us are allotting a lot <em>more </em>mental real estate to the contents of our crisper drawers in an attempt to avoid unnecessary trips to the grocery store &#8212; we’re buying somewhere around <a href="https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/coronavirus-sales-boom-could-be-short-lived-costly-analyst-warns">30 to 60 percent more groceries than usual</a>, after all. But that ambition doesn’t necessarily mean all of us have the habits in place to keep that real estate in order, so to speak.</p>
<p>Keeping your fridge stocked without much of its contents ending up in your compost bin (note: this is also <a href="https://grist.org/article/its-so-easy-to-compost-so-why-am-i-still-not-doing-it/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">a great time to get a compost bin</a> if you don’t already have one) isn’t hard, but it does take a modicum of effort. To that end, I made up a very basic, fly-by-night system to organize yourself, your groceries, and your cooking. You can basically modify it however works for you! The idea is just to keep track of what you buy and when it will go bad using lists, and keeping that information in plain sight on your refrigerator.</p>
<p>The system is extremely low-tech, and it’s based on a series of lists: picking out a few exciting things you want to try cooking before you go to the grocery store, putting ingredients for those meals on your grocery list, writing down when all the food items you’ve purchased will start to go bad, and then making a cooking schedule to accommodate all those (approximate &#8212; <a href="https://grist.org/food/food-expiration-dates-are-garbage-heres-a-new-label-thatll-make-you-think-before-you-toss/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">we’re all guessing</a>) expiration dates. I suggest putting these lists in plain sight, like on your fridge, to keep your meal plan front-of-mind.</p>
<p>Watch the video below to get started.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='630' height='355' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-0MFlFPG8Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The more you cook at home and develop your own habits and systems, the <a href="https://grist.org/ask-umbra/how-do-i-make-myself-cook-at-home/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">more conscious you’ll be of food waste in general</a>. The biggest part of successful home cooking &#8212; and especially successful coronavirus cooking, when you may find yourself one or two ingredients short of a traditional recipe &#8212; is really just creativity: figuring out how to <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/pantry-recipe-finder-article">incorporate and substitute random ingredients</a> that you have to use before they go bad, inventively repurposing leftovers, <a href="https://www.eater.com/2020/4/14/21219885/freezer-defrosting-tips">learning how to freeze properly</a>, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>My hope is that this gives you a little inspiration to develop your own organizational systems to keep your kitchen relatively sane, because we could all <a href="https://grist.org/climate/miss-anthropocene-the-grimes-album-tailor-made-for-the-coronavirus-pandemic/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">use a little sanity</a> when and where we can get it right now.</p>
<p>Neurotically,</p>
<p>Umbra</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The climate wonks who helped Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington state and former presidential candidate, put out more than 200 pages of policy are back with a new group called the Evergreen Collaborative.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington state, distinguished himself as a presidential candidate last year by making climate change the <a href="https://grist.org/article/a-tale-of-two-washingtons-how-jay-inslee-aims-to-take-his-climate-plan-nationwide/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">foundational building block of his platform</a>. Inslee has been out of the 2020 race for almost eight months now, but his green legacy and his team of climate wonks are still thriving.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, several key members of the governor’s presidential climate team, the crew that helped Inslee pump out <a href="https://grist.org/politics/climate-candidate-2020-election-president-trump-biden-sanders-warren/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">hundreds of pages of policy proposals</a> in a matter of months last year, announced that they’re forming a nonprofit called Evergreen to shape Democratic climate politics in the coronavirus era. Evergreen kicked things off by unveiling a green stimulus plan dubbed the <a href="https://medium.com/@sam.t.ricketts/evergreen-action-plan-3f705ecb500a">Evergreen Action Plan</a> that revamps Inslee’s proposals for the unique, pandemic-ravaged moment we’re in.</p>
<p>Evergreen’s bigger aim is to build out a platform that can be used by presumptive nominee Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress to keep climate policy on the front burner in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis. Evergreen already sent its 85-page action plan to Biden’s team, in addition to the offices of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the House and Senate climate crisis committees.</p>
<p>“This is a critical juncture for climate policy, especially as Congress is debating stimulus,” Jared Leopold, formerly senior communications advisor for Inslee and a member of the new initiative, told Grist. “It’s clear that the next president and Congress will have to revitalize the economy coming out of this health and economic crisis, and we think building a clean energy economy that’s oriented around the future is one of the best ways to put people to work and to address the climate crisis that can’t wait any longer.”</p>
<p>The plan was written by former Inslee campaign staffers Sam Ricketts, Bracken Hendricks, and Maggie Thomas (who joined Elizabeth Warren’s team after Inslee dropped out). Inslee himself is not directly affiliated with the new group, but his fingerprints are all over its proposals.</p>
<p>The plan contains a 12-part roadmap to revitalize the economy and address the climate crisis simultaneously and breathes new life into many of Inslee’s greatest hits from his campaign. The plan is even more comprehensive than Inslee’s campaign proposals, which were already borderline encyclopedic. It includes a regulatory strategy to transition the U.S. off of fossil fuels and onto renewable energy, a blueprint for mobilizing global climate action beyond what’s called for in the Paris Agreement, and a proposal to establish a climate conservation corps, which would put young Americans to work on sustainability solutions at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The Evergreen Action Plan also contains <a href="https://grist.org/article/a-qa-with-the-policy-wonks-who-wrote-jay-inslees-climate-plans/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">some ideas</a> that didn’t make it into Inslee’s campaign proposals. For example, Ricketts, Hendricks, and Thomas make a case for the establishment of a White House Office of Climate Mobilization, similar to the World War II-era Office of War Mobilization, that would work with existing White House offices to enforce the president’s climate agenda across the entire federal government. Warren’s influence is evident in the plan, too. Her <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/blue-new-deal">Blue New Deal</a> proposal, aimed at protecting oceans and the flora and fauna living in them from climate change, has its own subsection.</p>
<p>Back in the Before Times, when more than 20 Democratic candidates were running for president, support for the Green New Deal was the <a href="https://grist.org/article/the-green-new-deal-is-here-and-its-quickly-becoming-a-test-for-2020-democrats/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">de facto litmus test</a> for whether a candidate was serious about climate change or not. Now, times have changed. The country is facing a historic recession, and economic recovery is the name of the game. But that doesn’t mean that the <a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1062737225">public’s appetite for climate policy</a> has changed.</p>
<p>Democrats tried to attach climate conditions to the federal government’s airline bailouts in the recent coronavirus relief package, but President Trump and Senate Republicans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/us-coronavirus-relief-package-airlines-fossil-fuel-companies-climate">blocked those efforts</a>. Democrats might have more success incorporating climate policy into future economic stimulus legislation if the Senate or presidency flips blue in November. The question then is, will a President Biden seek to make incremental progress on climate change as the economy recovers, or will he go all in on the kind of sweeping green stimulus bill outlined in the Evergreen Action Plan?</p>
<p>“We feel good about the momentum behind this issue, and we think it’s an issue that can galvanize supporters around the country,” Leopold said. “I think it’s a smart issue for any candidate to lean into.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's not all sunshine and happy chickens]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The natural world can be wonderful, but it’s often terrible. It tortures the creatures within it, kills infants, and, oh yeah, produces pandemic viruses. This isn’t incidental; it’s central, the very engine of evolution. Yet, when people see the word “natural” in the grocery store aisle, it conjures up sunshine, happy chickens, and warm hugs. You forget all the nasty bits.</p>
<p>“There’s no chance that supermarket shoppers will mistake ‘all natural’ for a warning instead of an endorsement,” writes Alan Levinovitz in his new book. <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Natural.html?id=rRmhDwAAQBAJ"><em>Natural: How Faith in Nature&#8217;s Goodness Leads to Harmful Fads, Unjust Laws, and Flawed Science</em></a>. It scrutinizes the way people use the idea of natural goodness to justify their position whether it&#8217;s free-market boosterism, opposition to birth control, or supporting farm-to-table restaurants. This naturalness, he writes, is “a mercenary ethic that anyone can hire to fight for their cause.”</p>
<p>Levinovitz teaches religion at James Madison University, and to him, the way we embrace the idea of natural goodness looks exactly like religion. So when the coronavirus began to spread earlier this year, Levinovitz waited for people to react as if it were an act of a vengeful God, retribution for humans sinning against nature. He didn’t have to wait long. You’ve probably seen the memes suggesting that “We are the virus.”</p>
<p>We asked Levinovitz what he means when he says allegiance to nature has the hallmarks of religion, why nature has such a strong grip on our collective unconscious, and how we might think differently if we stopped believing in a God-like nature.</p>
<p><span class="qa">Q.</span> <strong>Let’s start with the coronavirus. Why are people drawn to this idea of nature taking retribution on destructive humans?</strong></p>
<p><span class="qa">A.</span> When confronted with unexpected suffering we want to take universalizable lessons from it. It feels like we should have an existential solution to what feels like an existential problem. So with coronavirus, the real solutions aren’t universal truths. They are very local, specific fixes: Figure out how to better regulate our interactions with wild species; figure out how to slow the spread of viruses quickly; figure out the infrastructure to deal with sick people. But those kinds of solutions don&#8217;t address the existential angst, so people turn to things like, “This is our punishment for living wrong,” or the meme that “humans are the virus,” which is taken from the movie The Matrix.</p>
<p><span class="qa">Q.</span> <strong>So people are looking for a more meaningful way to explain the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p><span class="qa">A.</span> There are more sophisticated versions of the &#8220;humans are the virus&#8221; messages, but in the end they all boil down to: There is a harmony in nature, and humans disrupt it in a variety of ways whether it&#8217;s through burning forests, or industrial agriculture, or eating the wrong kind of animal. At the end of the day it&#8217;s this search for universal laws that we have violated. If you can explain the pandemic as the consequence of violating nature’s laws that is reassuring because it means you know what went wrong, you know how to fix it, and you know how to fix the future. That&#8217;s extremely important, especially in times of crisis. If you are not going to locate those universal laws in God, you have to locate them in some other harmonious entity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that the same narrative comes up all the time with religion: Why was there a hurricane? Because people were having unnatural sex. This idea that living unnaturally results in a punishment, has been around for a very long time. So I&#8217;m not surprised to see the same kinds of things coming up. The important thing to note is that this time they look secular, even when they are actually religious.</p>
<p><span class="qa">Q.</span> <strong>Some people might be thinking, “Wait, I say things like, ‘it’s only natural,’ all the time!” Is that a sign of stealth religious faith?</strong></p>
<p><span class="qa">A.</span> The idea that natural is good is so baked into our language, our consciousness, and even the subconscious myths that guide us through the world, that it can sometimes be difficult to get out of those myths and see them for what they are. One way to make it visible is to point to its inverse, the futurist&#8217;s myth. So the futurist looks to a utopia in which nature has disappeared and things are harmonious because humans have complete control. And to most people, myself included, that way of thinking makes no sense. We would never say, “The computer works because it is unnatural.” We would never say, “Eyeglasses are beneficial because they are artificial.” That is a bizarre way to think about things! Yet we attribute the same kind of causal goodness to nature all the time: This food is good for kids because it is natural. And we invert it too: Screens are bad for our children because they are unnatural. What I want people to understand is that that makes no more or less sense than saying things are good because they are artificial.</p>
<p><span class="qa">Q.</span> <strong>Why does this way of thinking have so much power over us?</strong></p>
<p><span class="qa">A.</span> The word natural itself has to do with origins and birth. It really is an organizing force from beyond and before humans. Nature really did give birth to our solar system, to life, to humans, plants, and animals. So there&#8217;s something tremendously compelling about that force. And there&#8217;s an intuition that we ought to be grateful for it, right? It&#8217;s a respect for a cosmic force, like the respect one might have for their parents. Surely it&#8217;s a good force, surely it&#8217;s a force we should not violate. So that&#8217;s a big part of why we have this reflexive respect for nature and naturalness.</p>
<p><span class="qa">Q.</span> <strong>I wrote a book, <em>All Natural</em>, on the same subject, and one of the conclusions I came to was that this nostalgia for a pre-industrial Eden was really a nostalgia for childhood. What do you think about that?</strong></p>
<p><span class="qa">A.</span> Nostalgia takes you back to a simpler time. But that simplicity comes from the fact that you are ignorant of the complexity. The childlike vision of the world is one where you don&#8217;t understand how things work: The dishes just magically get washed, and the food magically appears, and there&#8217;s something wonderful about that. People who don&#8217;t study the pre-industrial past have that same childlike vision of what life was like because they don’t know all of the bad things about it. Nostalgia is a selective forgetting.</p>
<p><span class="qa">Q.</span> <strong>How did your own belief system change as you investigated this?</strong></p>
<p><span class="qa">A.</span> I went into this book thinking it was going to be a straight debunking of naturalness. That&#8217;s not where I ended up. I ended up thinking it makes sense to value things simply because they are natural: Yellowstone National Park is valuable because it is more natural than other places. It&#8217;s fine to value naturalness in the same way that we might value freedom or beauty. The problem is that it&#8217;s not the only value &#8212; which is where you get when you confuse nature with God. That means there are going to be tradeoffs sometimes. Sometimes what&#8217;s natural is not going to be good for our health. Sometimes what&#8217;s natural &#8212; take Yellowstone &#8212; is not going to be good for something else we value, like accessibility. You have to have a road through Yellowstone Park or people can&#8217;t get to it, so you make it slightly less natural. I came out of this project thinking we need to be able to love and value nature without worshipping it. That is to say, without assuming that any departure from nature is corrupt or bad.</p>
<p><span class="qa">Q.</span> <strong>But where does that leave you? Practically, in your daily life.</strong></p>
<p><span class="qa">A.</span> My editors asked the same thing. What&#8217;s the alternative? We run into these questions all the time. How do I parent my kid? What do I eat? How should I choose to give birth? When you take away that simple and existentially satisfying rule of thumb that natural is good, you need to put something in its place.</p>
<p>My answer to that is that we need to be comfortable with uncertainty. Sometimes the natural approach will be better. Sometimes the natural approach will be worse. It&#8217;s unfortunate because that&#8217;s not a satisfying theological answer.</p>
<p><span class="qa">Q.</span> <strong>It can be an exciting answer though. Embracing uncertainty means embracing dynamism and wonder.</strong></p>
<p><span class="qa">A.</span> I love the word wonder because wonder is an optimist&#8217;s synonym for doubt or uncertainty. To wonder is to not know. But it&#8217;s to not know in a way that makes for awe and joy rather than anxiety and ignorance.</p>
<p>One thing that&#8217;s really helped me, especially during this uncertain time, is that I don&#8217;t see uncertainty as something that needs to be overcome, but celebrated instead. As I was talking to the experts I interviewed for this book, I noticed that the most knowledgeable people are more attuned to complexity: The more you learn, the more your expectations are overturned, and that experience of uncertainty becomes normal.</p>
<p>This is really important at this time of the pandemic. It&#8217;s OK &#8212; imperative even &#8212; to change our minds. When a scientific body or a government shifts its position on something because new data has come in, that does not represent weakness or a violation of a law that we used to think was universal. It just means that they are being responsible rather than dogmatic. Reframing uncertainty as wonder, and certainty as dogmatism, can do a lot for feeling more secure in our uncertainty.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At a hearing on Tuesday, Texas formally considered statewide cuts in oil production for the first time since the 1970s.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Texas just did something that only recently might have been unthinkable. The state whose name is synonymous with American oil took the unusual step of formally considering statewide cuts in oil production — a step that hasn’t been taken since the 1970s.</p>
<p>At an <a href="http://www.adminmonitor.com/tx/rrc/open_meeting/20200414/">online public hearing</a> the state hosted on Tuesday, oil and gas company representatives painted a picture of devastation — bankrupt companies and tens of thousands of jobs lost — if Texas and other states and countries didn’t deliberately scale back production to counteract a free fall in oil prices.</p>
<p>“If the Texas Railroad Commission does not regulate long term, we will disappear as an industry, <a href="https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IEEFA-comments-to-the-RRC-of-Texas-April-7-2020.pdf">like the coal industry</a>,” said Scott Sheffield, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources, referring to the state agency that oversees oil and gas production. “The Commission really does not have any wiggle room to do nothing in the unprecedented, disastrous circumstances of today.”</p>

	</aside></p>
<p>More than <a href="https://twitter.com/Mr_McCormick/status/1250157268433350660">20,000</a> interested viewers from across the world tuned in to the hearing, which had not even cycled through half of its <a href="https://www.rrc.state.tx.us/media/57311/speaker-order-april-14-2020-final.pdf">55 scheduled speakers</a> as the end of the day neared.</p>
<p>The intensity of interest is in part due to the fact that the hearing comes on the heels of a major international <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/business/energy-environment/opec-russia-saudi-arabia-oil-coronavirus.html">agreement</a> reached Sunday by more than 20 oil-producing countries. They agreed to slash global oil production by about 10 percent, or roughly 9.7 million barrels per day, in May and June. The companies represented at Tuesday’s hearing said that, while that agreement was a step in the right direction, it would not be sufficient to boost oil prices, which have fallen from about $60 per barrel in January to $20. Even with the upcoming international cuts, industry <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-global-oil-demand-trafigura/global-oil-demand-could-fall-around-a-third-next-month-trafigura-idUSKBN21H2WX">analysts</a> <a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/IEA-Boss-Warns-Demand-Will-Plunge-By-20-Million-Barrels-Per-Day.html">estimate</a> that there’s still an oversupply of about 10 to 20 million barrels of oil produced each day.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s hearing was called in response to a petition by Pioneer Natural Resources and Parsley Energy, two major producers in the Permian Basin, a shale play straddling West Texas and New Mexico that is responsible for <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/energy11/permian#Oil">almost 40 percent</a> of U.S. oil production. Over the past few months, a huge drop in global demand — caused by the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic — has combined with chronic oversupply to kneecap the industry.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, proration — the industry term for reducing production — appears to be a long shot. For one, oil and gas companies are divided over whether state regulators should get involved or wait and let markets correct the oversupply. The split is between smaller and larger companies, with independent producers in the former camp mostly supportive of production cuts. However, prorationing is opposed by major producers such as Marathon Oil as well as industry associations including the American Petroleum Institute, the Texas Oil and Gas Association, and the Texas Independent Producers &amp; Royalty Owners Association.</p>
<p>“The shale revolution would not have begun here in Texas without free market principles,” said Lee Tillman, CEO of Marathon Oil. “When a vocal minority takes a position in favor of artificial market manipulation that is so far removed from the consensus of a vast majority of operators, one can only surmise that their motives and objectives are primarily company-specific — as opposed to broadly industry-supportive.”</p>
<p>Texas producers also raised concerns that, if the state were to cut production, other states would simply fill the void and undo any potential benefits in terms of shoring up prices. In other words, Texas alone is unlikely to raise prices by prorationing. There are <a href="https://grist.org/energy/in-texas-a-half-baked-plan-to-save-the-oil-industry-from-a-coronavirus-fueled-crash/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">few indications</a> that other states will follow Texas’ lead, though oil and gas companies <a href="https://oklahoman.com/article/5659943/coronavirus-in-oklahoma-oklahoma-energy-producers-alliance-asks-corporation-commission-for-oil-production-cuts">filed</a> a similar request to consider production cuts with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission last week.</p>
<p>At Tuesday’s hearing, Texas environmental groups and some oil and gas companies made a different case for prorationing as well: that it could reduce an industry practice called flaring. Every year, oil producers burn off millions of tons of natural gas into the air — a <a href="https://grist.org/energy/how-the-oil-price-collapse-could-reduce-methane-emissions-or-make-them-much-worse/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">practice</a> that is both wasteful and harmful to the environment. Companies typically flare when there isn’t enough pipeline capacity to move natural gas to refineries, or when it simply isn’t worth the cost to do so.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rrc.state.tx.us/media/57250/cmts-recvd-apr14-conf-edf.pdf">written comments</a> submitted to the Texas Railroad Commission, Scott Anderson, a senior director at the Environmental Defense Fund, wrote that prorationing “must be designed to help reduce natural gas flaring” and that flaring is “the most obvious waste occurring in Texas today.”</p>
<p>Some oil and gas company representatives also echoed those sentiments at the hearing, noting that prorationing could be the perfect chance to cut down on flaring, given that the Commission has faced criticism in the past for not adequately addressing the issue.</p>
<p>“Flaring in the Permian Basin is the biggest black eye of our industry,” said Kirk Edwards, CEO of Latigo Petroleum, a small producer based in Odessa. “It is the biggest case for waste that we have — and what a great chance for all of y&#8217;all to do something about that.”</p>
<p>The commissioners, who are elected and serve six-year terms, struck a careful balance at the hearing. Though they said that they had “reservations” about a proration program, they also indicated that they wanted to gather additional information about its potential effects on both small and large producers, whether it would be effective in lowering prices, and how it might be structured. The commissioners <a href="https://www.mrt.com/business/oil/article/RRC-to-discuss-market-demand-request-15180680.php">could reach a decision</a> as soon as April 21.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Why public discourse seems to get stuck fighting everything.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do climate change, drugs, and Christmas have in common? The United States has supposedly been at “war” with all of them.</p>
<p>When facing any sort of crisis, big or small, Americans often frame the situation through the lens of a battle. So when coronavirus brought daily life in the United States to a halt last month, it seemed nearly inevitable that President Donald Trump would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/23/invisible-enemy-trump-says-he-is-wartime-president-in-coronavirus-battle-video">declare</a> himself a “wartime president.”</p>
<p>“The world is at war with a hidden enemy,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239997820242923521">tweeted</a>. “WE WILL WIN!”</p>

<p>Similar language has been invoked by leaders around the world. France’s President Emmanuel Macron deployed the phrase “we are at war” no less than <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/03/france-paris-emmanuel-macron-coronavirus-covid19/608200/">six times</a> in one speech last month. And in a rare special address to the United Kingdom last week, Queen Elizabeth II <a href="https://www.royal.uk/queens-broadcast-uk-and-commonwealth">invoked</a> the “Blitz spirit” of World War II, a time of shared sacrifice.</p>
<p>Wartime rhetoric serves as an aggressive moral appeal, drumming up emotion and calling people to action. But here’s the thing about the war on coronavirus: We’ve already lost it.</p>
<p>“I think war metaphors are best used as a mobilizing effort,” said Stephen Flusberg, an associate professor of psychology at Purchase College in New York. “And it’s too late in the United States. We’ve failed.”</p>
<p>If coronavirus were truly a “war,” the United States would be the best prepared in the world, with a so-called “defense” budget at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/what-the-pentagon-is-asking-for-in-its-705-billion-budget.html">$700 billion</a> a year and climbing &#8212; more than what the next seven largest countries spend <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/chart-archive/0053_defense-comparison">added together</a>. What the country was unprepared for was a pandemic, something infectious disease experts had warned was eventually coming.</p>
<p>Warlike language has been part of our speech for so long, it usually goes unnoticed. When the Spanish Flu hit England in the summer of 1918, newspapers <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/epub/10.5465/amj.2016.0054">warned</a> their readers to prepare “defenses” against the disease. Soon enough, they described the flu as a “new foe,” and people freaked out, panic-buying quinine. It sounds <a href="https://grist.org/food/coronavirus-myth-busting-the-truth-about-empty-shelves-and-toilet-paper-shortages/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">all too familiar</a> to anyone who’s been following the news of coronavirus, which the New York Times first painted as a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/asia/china-SARS-pneumonialike.html">mystery</a>” illness in January, something to “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-cuomo.html">combat</a>” in February, and an “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/health/coronavirus-china-aylward.html">all-out war</a>” in March.</p>
<p>Fighting words have their time and place, language experts say, but public discourse seems to get stuck fighting everything. Studies show that this framing can paralyze people with fear and limit our collective imagination about what can be done to fix complex problems. In times of pandemic, calling the virus an “invisible enemy” <a href="https://lighthouse.mq.edu.au/article/march/Fighting-words-how-war-metaphors-can-trigger-racism">can evoke</a> xenophobia and racism. The framing primes people to view problems like climate change as a battlefield &#8212; this side vs. that side &#8212; <a href="https://grist.org/climate/the-war-on-climate-the-climate-fight-are-we-approaching-the-problem-all-wrong/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">widening partisan divides</a> while obscuring any common ground.</p>
<p>“When a metaphor is used again and again and again, it really makes people experience something in those terms,” said Veronika Koller, a linguist at Lancaster University in England. In other words, people start to feel like they’re living in wartime. This can help governments gain public support for short-term actions that would normally be unpopular, like closing borders or exercising emergency powers. But for a prolonged crisis, it results in fatigue, Koller said. From climate change to cancer to coronavirus, the struggle is not a matter of weeks, but months, years, and decades.</p>
<p>Researchers say that it’s clear we need a new way to discuss big problems, a broader repertoire of metaphors to choose from. “There’s a paucity of the imagination around insurmountable challenges,” said Brent Ryan Bellamy, an instructor at Trent University in Canada.</p>
<p>Last week, Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1248630671754563585?s=20">tweeted</a>, “The Invisible Enemy will soon be in full retreat!” Though he didn’t mention the virus, no one seemed confused by what he was referring to &#8212; a sign that the war narrative has firmly taken hold. But others are already describing the pandemic in creative terms, comparing the government’s response to a storyline in a <a href="https://twitter.com/HannahLebovits/status/1246958138403753984">Harry Potter</a> book, or practicing social distancing to <a href="https://twitter.com/ClassicFM/status/1243472908581777408">a string section playing quietly</a> (it only works, after all, if everyone does it). A group of linguists are attempting to #ReframeCovid, tracking international efforts to put new words to the crisis.</p>
<p>Flipping the usual script can lead to fresh critiques, new alliances, and eventually, if the new metaphors take hold, different ways to cope.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[2020 Grist 50 Fixer Corina Newsome talks about a life-altering trip behind the scenes at the Philadelphia Zoo.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>These days, we all could use a little good news</em> — <em>so we’re presenting a few of this year’s </em><a href="https://grist.org/grist-50/2020/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist"><em>Grist 50</em></a><em> Fixers, in depth. For a </em><em>quick dose of hope and optimism, meet 2020 Fixer Corina Newsome.</em></p>
<p>As a child, Corina Newsome always loved animals, but she had no idea she could spend her life working with them, studying them, and making a difference in conservation and environmental issues. Newsome, who was recently named to the <a href="https://grist.org/grist-50/2020/#corina-newsome?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">2020 Grist 50</a>, is a former zookeeper and current master’s student at Georgia Southern University. She tells us about the fortuitous event that changed the direction of her life. Her words have been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>
<h3>“I was 18, and I’d never been to the zoo!”</h3>
<p>I grew up in Germantown, in Philadelphia. There was not a whole lot of wildlife, but I had a lot of books, I had a wildlife encyclopedia, and National Geographic magazines &#8212; hundreds of them. My favorite pastime was paging through those books and transporting myself to different parts of the world, seeing the wildlife in my mind. Also, both my parents were very outdoorsy, and my mom would take me way out of the city to go on hikes.</p>
<p>In a strange turn of events, a zookeeper at the Philadelphia Zoo, a black woman, reached out to me and asked if I wanted to go behind the scenes with her. I was 18, and I’d never been to the zoo! That was a transformative experience, and it kickstarted the zookeeper-wildlife conservation career for me. I was a zookeeper for about three and a half years, and it was the most fun thing I ever did with my time. I also did public outreach, animal shows, and educational programs around Nashville.</p>
<p>Just that one behind-the-scenes experience with a black woman changed the trajectory of my career, so I thought: What if we could have a program that gave those one-day experiences to students of color in the Nashville area who were impoverished, like I was growing up? In 2017 I created the Pathway to Animal Care Careers program that targeted high schools where 70 percent or more of the students are on free or reduced-price lunches. Each student spent a day with me, feeding and cleaning and taking tours of different areas of the zoo.</p>
<p>I found myself wanting to participate more in the science that undergirds conservation, for birds in particular. Now I’m studying the seaside sparrow, which is adapted to a very extreme environment. To watch these fragile and vulnerable creatures hatch out of the egg, survive, and grow blows my mind every time.</p>
<p>I’m also on the steering committee for <a href="https://yecaction.org/">Young Evangelicals for Climate Action</a>, which mobilizes Christian communities to act on climate change, through civic engagement and trying to influence policy. It also engages college-age students, who can apply for a stipend to institute a green or sustainability initiative on their campus.</p>
<p>When it comes to climate action, or any kind of social activism, the reason I’m doing it is central to my faith. In the Christian faith, there’s a huge emphasis on stewarding the natural world, and on loving your neighbor. Climate is a social-justice issue, because the people who least caused the problem, and are least able to cope with it, are those having to overcome the largest hurdles.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A showdown between tech employees and management over the company’s climate and coronavirus policies reached a tipping point last week.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is trying to establish itself as the most essential of essential businesses during the coronavirus outbreak. But the tech giant is struggling to keep a lid on internal turmoil, both at its warehouses, where workers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216172/amazon-coronavirus-protests-response-safety-jfk8-fired-covid-19">say they’re not being adequately protected</a> from COVID-19, and at its corporate offices, where a showdown between tech employees and management over the company’s climate policies reached a tipping point last week.</p>
<p>Last Friday afternoon, Amazon fired two of its tech employees after they publicly criticized its coronavirus policies. Those employees, Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, both user experience designers with 21 years of service at the company between them, were among the leaders of an internal worker group formed in December 2018 with the aim of pressuring Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to commit to more ambitious climate targets. The group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ), has recently <a href="https://grist.org/justice/amazon-climate-strikers-demand-stronger-coronavirus-protections-for-warehouse-workers/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">widened its focus</a> to embrace the struggles of frontline Amazon employees at fulfillment centers across the country.</p>
<p>Cunningham and Costa were fired after they wrote tweets criticizing the company for putting workers and the public at risk and offering to match up to $500 in donations to a fund for Amazon warehouse workers exposed to COVID-19.</p>
<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In addition to firing Cunningham and Costa, AECJ says the company deleted an invitation to a virtual event that the worker group had sent to Amazon employees to allow them to “hear directly from Amazon warehouse workers as they talk honestly about the real problems they&#8217;re facing as well as solutions.”</p>
<p>The goal of the AECJ webcast, which was to feature author and climate justice activist Naomi Klein, was to explore questions like, “How are Covid-19, the climate crisis, and the struggles of warehouse workers connected? How are all of these issues tied to racism and inequity?” More than 1,000 employees had RSVPed to the event before it was taken down, AECJ said <a href="https://twitter.com/AMZNforClimate/status/1250136257142775808">in a press release</a>, adding that internal emails about the event had also been deleted by the company.</p>
<p>“Why is Amazon so scared of workers talking with each other? No company should punish their employees for showing concern for one another, especially during a pandemic!&#8221; Costa said in a statement. She and Cunningham say they still plan to host the virtual event with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuadRhxbRzL0j_n8P12bKI0fW3oaYkpWh1wD7HGYBZ6HZZcA/viewform">new RSVP link</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/13/amazon-workers-fired/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook">statement to the Washington Post</a>, Amazon spokesperson Drew Herderner said, “We support every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies.”</p>
<p>AECJ has been publicly pushing Jeff Bezos to reduce the company’s contributions to climate change for more than a year now. In the summer of 2019, the group <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/22/18635604/amazon-shareholder-meeting-2019-climate-change-proposal">called on the company’s shareholders</a> to adopt a climate change resolution that was ultimately backed by more than 8,700 Amazon workers. It was voted down, but a few months later, Bezos unveiled a <a href="https://grist.org/beacon/bezos-unveils-a-climate-plan/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">climate plan</a> that aimed for net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 — a decade ahead of the deadline laid out in the Paris climate agreement. AECJ argued that the plan wasn’t comprehensive enough, and on September 20, in solidarity with the youth climate strikes happening all over the world, thousands of Amazon employees <a href="https://grist.org/article/hundreds-of-amazon-employees-walk-out-for-climate-strike/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">walked out</a> of the company’s headquarters in downtown Seattle.</p>
<p>Around the same time, the company updated its communication policies to require employees to seek approval from management before speaking publicly about Amazon. In October, when two of its employees, Costa and Jamie Kowalski, publicly criticized one of company’s climate policies, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/11/amazon-policy-manifesto-responds-environmental-workplace-data-privacy-critics/">telling the Washington Post</a> that it “distracts from the fact that Amazon wants to profit in businesses that are directly contributing to climate catastrophe,” the employees were warned that speaking out again would result in “formal corrective action.”</p>
<p>In response, 400 Amazon employees <a href="https://grist.org/climate/amazon-told-its-workers-not-to-criticize-its-climate-policies-they-didnt-listen/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">risked their jobs</a> to publicly speak out about the company’s climate policies. “We decided we couldn’t live with ourselves if we let a policy silence us in the face of an issue of such moral gravity like the climate crisis,” the group said in a tweet in January that has since been deleted.</p>
<p>It took a few months, but the company finally made good on its threat. Doesn’t look like the fired employees are going to stop speaking out anytime soon, though.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Environmental agencies are struggling to balance employee safety and their enforcement duties during the coronavirus lockdown.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a week after Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf announced a statewide shutdown, a journalist and activist in the western part of the state obtained video that appeared to show a large nearby storage tank leaking reddish-brown fracking wastewater.</p>
<p>Melissa Troutman, who co-founded a local muckraking publication and also works for the environmental nonprofit Earthworks, knew that fracking waste <a href="https://grist.org/energy/big-oil-wants-to-dump-more-wastewater-into-rivers-what-could-go-wrong/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">could be radioactive and toxic</a>, so she filed a complaint with the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Within a few hours, she received a surprising response: The agency would “look into the leak at the tank farm after the shutdown concludes.” With no end in sight to the nation’s coronavirus outbreak, Troutman was alarmed that the tank would leak indefinitely, potentially poisoning the surrounding land.</p>
<p>Troutman decided to share screenshots of the video with Grist. After Grist contacted the DEP to confirm Troutman’s account, the environmental agency sent an inspector to investigate. They found that what initially appeared to be a leak was, in fact, rust-colored staining from a previous leak that had been fixed. An agency spokesperson said that the DEP contacted JKLM Energy, the company that owns the storage tanks, after Grist contacted the agency. JKLM Energy provided photos to confirm the tanks weren’t leaking, and the agency concluded there was no evidence to suggest “the health of the local community [was] at imminent risk,” as Troutman suspected.</p>

<p>But Troutman isn’t satisfied with the agency’s response.</p>
<p>“Because of the reporter attention, they’ve changed their tune,” she said. “They only do the bare minimum when it comes to public health. But when it comes to industry, they use discretion.”</p>
<p>The DEP, for its part, says that additional safety features of the facility would have prevented a spill from spreading to surrounding areas, even if one had occurred. In any case, the agency planned to inspect the facility in a few days, a spokesperson told Grist.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_458006" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-458006" class="wp-caption alignleft image-container"><img class="size-full wp-image-458006" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tank-farm-leak.png?w=1024&#038;h=723" alt="photo of tank farm leak" width="1024" height="723" srcset="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tank-farm-leak.png?w=1024&amp;h=723 1024w, https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tank-farm-leak.png?w=330&amp;h=233 330w, https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tank-farm-leak.png?w=768&amp;h=542 768w, https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tank-farm-leak.png 1028w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-458006" class="wp-caption-text"><span class="caption">The discoloration surrounding one of the storage tanks, seen here in an image taken from drone footage, prompted Melissa Troutman to file a complaint with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.</span> <span class="credit">Courtesy of Melissa Troutman</span></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The incident highlights a key challenge that state environmental agencies are facing as local leaders across the U.S. announce shelter-in-place orders and social distancing measures. Regulatory agencies still have to enforce statutorily-mandated environmental requirements — which often require travel and human contact — while at the same time minimizing risks for their employees and doing their part to help contain the virus.</p>
<p>In states where many residents already consider environmental regulators too cozy with the polluting industries that form the bedrock of local economies, the balancing act could further erode public trust at a critical time — no matter how well it’s pulled off. The stakes are high: <a href="https://grist.org/justice/study-even-the-tiniest-amount-of-air-pollution-makes-covid-19-more-deadly/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">Research is beginning to show</a> that poor air quality is linked to a higher rate of fatality among those who contract COVID-19, and people of color who are disproportionately exposed to pollution are <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pke94n/cancer-alley-has-some-of-the-highest-coronavirus-death-rates-in-the-country">among the worst hit</a> by the virus.</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has delegated states <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34384.pdf">substantial authority</a> to enforce several major environmental programs under the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and other federal laws. As a result, state agencies are primarily responsible for assessing when companies violate those laws.</p>
<p>“Typically the state is presumed to have the lead role for most enforcement matters,” said Tracy Hester, an environmental law professor at the University of Houston. “If it’s delegated [to the] state, state carries water.”</p>
<p>In order to better understand how state environmental regulators are adapting to the crisis, Grist contacted six agencies representing Texas, Pennsylvania, Colorado, New Mexico, Washington state, and New York. We found that most states have scaled back field inspections to some degree, set up processes to receive documents online, and asked companies to submit requests for enforcement discretion if they want to claim that they’re unable to meet regulatory requirements due to the pandemic. When inspectors go out into the field, they’ve been instructed to wear protective gear and call ahead to determine whether there have been COVID-19 cases at the facilities they’re inspecting.</p>
<p>“The worst-case scenario for us would be if we have our folks exposed as well as the people in drinking water plants or sewage treatment plants,” said John Putnam, director of environmental programs at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. “If too many of them get sick, we&#8217;re going to have a hard time protecting the environment in the weeks to come. So we&#8217;re trying to look at the long game.”</p>
<h3><strong>Ongoing Fieldwork</strong></h3>
<p>Field inspections are a critical part of an environmental agency’s mission. Broadly, agency inspectors are out in the field to either conduct routine inspections of industrial facilities or to investigate a complaint. Many states have halted routine inspections, particularly those that require company representatives to be present during the inspection.</p>
<p>Though Putnam’s concern for employees’ safety was echoed across all six agencies surveyed by Grist, differences in enforcement approaches did emerge. Some states are suspending all inspections, others are continuing with business as usual, and many fall somewhere in between based on their analysis of the risks and benefits of sending inspectors into the field.</p>
<p>After Washington Governor Jay Inslee issued a shutdown order, the state Department of Ecology suspended all routine inspections and audits, except for cases where inspections are necessary for the imminent protection of public health or safety, such as during dam construction and repair. In New Mexico, the oil and gas regulatory agency has also announced that its inspectors “will not be performing any inspections that require other parties to be on site.”</p>
<p>Other states, however, are assessing risk on a case-by-case basis to give themselves more flexibility to potentially continue their normal work. The Colorado agency’s field inspection team went on a two-week hiatus while staff received training and the agency secured personal protective equipment. Before inspectors visit a facility, they now call the employee they expect to meet to ask if they’re exhibiting any symptoms of COVID-19 or have been in contact with anyone who has tested positive.</p>
<p>Texas, too, is continuing routine investigations “as circumstances allow.” The state is also permitting companies to substitute photographs and documentation in place of physical inspections wherever possible. Brian McGovern, a spokesperson for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said that staff have also offered companies the option to meet by video instead of in person.</p>
<p>All six state agencies Grist contacted said staff were responding to emergencies that put public health and safety at risk. In the last couple of weeks, the Texas and Pennsylvania environmental agencies have responded to more than two dozen complaints about fish kills, odor from a controlled burn at a wildlife preserve, drinking water supply concerns, and manure spills, among other issues.</p>
<p></div></div><figure id="attachment_460561" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-460561" class="wp-caption alignnone jumbo image-container"><img class="wp-image-460561 size-full" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/ap_656028436223.jpg?w=2000&#038;h=1333" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-460561" class="wp-caption-text">A dead carp floats in water contaminated with manure spills and runoff from farm fields. <span class="credit">Charlie Neibergall / AP Photo</span></figcaption></figure><div class="row"><div class="lf-content"></p>
<p>Megan Lehman, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania DEP, said that the agency’s “first responsibility” is to protect the health of its employees and the general public, given the severity of the pandemic. The agency is prioritizing inspections of critical infrastructure such as drinking water and sewage treatment facilities and cases where there’s an imminent threat to public health, she said. Field inspections can create risks under the current circumstances because staff now have limited access to offices, vehicles, equipment, and support services — all of which are helpful if inspectors find themselves having to navigate an emergency, such as a vehicle breakdown.</p>
<p>“Such a decision must be made carefully,” Lehman said.</p>
<h3><strong>Discretionary Enforcement</strong></h3>
<p>State agencies are poised to play a particularly important role during the pandemic. The EPA announced last month that it would not issue fines to companies that fail to meet certain monitoring and reporting requirements. Environmental advocates say that the federal agency’s new policy is too broad and essentially places a moratorium on enforcement while the crisis plays out. The rollback also comes at a time when many industries are facing enormous financial pressure, potentially providing an incentive for unscrupulous companies to cut corners.</p>
<p>“I can see a company trying to operate in oil and gas, where <a href="https://grist.org/energy/coronavirus-fallout-could-be-the-nail-in-the-coffin-for-smaller-oil-companies/?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grist">prices have cratered</a> — they’re anxious and distracted,” said <a href="https://environmentalintegrity.org/who-we-are/our-staff/">Eric Shaeffer</a>, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former director of the EPA’s Office of Civil Enforcement. “That’s understandable, but it doesn’t let you off the hook. I don’t get to speed now because of coronavirus.”</p>
<p>Many state agencies are largely following the EPA’s lead in offering to exercise discretion in cases where companies say they are suddenly unable to comply with environmental rules. States have either set up email inboxes specifically to receive requests for enforcement discretion or posted points of contact for such requests.</p>
<p>The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/covid-19-and-environmental-compliance-business-usual-or-it">has said</a> it will use “reasonable discretion” in deciding when to pursue enforcement. In New York, a spokesperson for the Department of Conservation said the agency expected companies to document compliance challenges with a “reasonably direct connection to the COVID-19 emergency.”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve tried to get really creative in our processes,” said Adrienne Sandoval, director of New Mexico’s oil conservation division, <a href="http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/OCD/documents/How_To_OCD_Business_Operations_During_Emergency_Declaration_3-20-20.pdf">referring to systems her division has set up</a> to accept online applications. “We&#8217;re just trying to act and make sure that we&#8217;re still doing our job … while also making sure that our staff is safe.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether exceptions are made during the pandemic depends on how state agencies respond to those requests. Schaeffer said that there are legitimate reasons why businesses may not be able to comply with environmental regulations during the crisis — and that such enforcement requests aren’t inherently a sign of companies trying to cut corners. But those requests need to be scrutinized carefully, he said, and should not be granted without careful consideration. “It creates a wider range of excuses for some companies who can be fairly confident that claims of coronavirus won’t be followed up,” he said.</p>
<p>The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), for instance, said in an advisory email that if “noncompliance is unavoidable directly due to impact from the coronavirus,” it will consider requests for enforcement discretion. Such requests will be “expeditiously addressed” and companies will receive a response within 24 to 48 hours, it noted.</p>

<p>McGovern, the TCEQ spokesperson, said that the agency has received 73 requests from 45 companies as of April 5. The majority of requests were to allow delays in submitting reports as outlined in their permits. Some companies use third-party contractors to collect and report data, and with the shelter-in-pace orders, contractors are either not able to travel or companies are choosing to limit access to protect their workers, he said.</p>
<p>In contrast, some state agencies have responded with strongly-worded guidance documents to drive home the point that the pandemic does not provide a pass to pollute. In a March 17 advisory, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment stated that “regulatory requirements remain in place and must be followed.” The agency also released a three-page document answering questions about requests for permit extensions and submitting documents electronically. After the EPA’s announcement, it followed up with a press release highlighting its enforcement work to hold an oil and gas company accountable for emitting pollutants in excess of its permit limits — even during the pandemic.</p>
<p>An agency spokesperson said that its air pollution division has granted 12 enforcement discretion requests so far. Ten of those were for delaying emissions tests or audits of emission monitors.</p>
<p>Schaeffer and other environmental advocates have good reason to be concerned about enforcement at the local level. A 2019 Environmental Integrity Report <a href="https://www.eenews.net/assets/2019/12/04/document_pm_02.pdf">found</a> that between 2008 and 2018, 30 states — including Texas, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania — slashed their environmental agencies’ budgets.</p>
<p>For instance, the Pennsylvania DEP’s funding decreased by 16 percent, even as the state budget grew 18 percent and oil and gas companies drilled more than 19,000 new wells. In 2016, the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4Y3VQLxjkxObjZ0ZXlSVDZvRWc/view">EPA warned the agency</a> that its drinking water inspectors were overworked and were handling double the number of average cases nationwide. “This kind of excessive workload is not sustainable and program performance will continue to suffer,” it noted. (The <a href="https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/08/17/after-epa-warning-pa-hikes-fees-on-water-systems-to-hire-more-inspectors/">DEP raised fees</a> on public water systems to hire more inspectors in 2018.)</p>
<p>Environmental groups and community advocates say that, as the crisis unfolds, the lack of transparency from the EPA and some state agencies makes it challenging to assess how they’re responding to the energy industry’s requests for leniency.</p>
<p>Patrice Simms, vice president for healthy communities at the nonprofit Earthjustice, said that his group will “continue to keep an eye on both what EPA is doing and what we&#8217;re hearing from state enforcement authorities,” especially if it’s likely to increase the pollution burden for local communities. “The simple truth is that this is not the time to be cutting public health regulations — during a public health crisis.”</p>
