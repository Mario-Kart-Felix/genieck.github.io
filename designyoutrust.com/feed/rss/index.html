										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The lockdown is the ideal time to do the things around the house that you’ve neglected for way too long—things like finally getting rid of the stuff you stashed “just in case” and ended up not using in 5 years or sorting the heap of clothes on that one chair at home.

The pictures, each 8in by 10in, were taken by court photographer Anthony Buckley in 1963 to ­feature on Canadian notes.
