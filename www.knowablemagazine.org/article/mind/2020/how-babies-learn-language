    </aside><p>Children go from babbling, starting by about 6 months, to speaking their first words around the age of 1, to forming full sentences by their third year. This process, known as <a class="" href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/faq-how-do-we-learn-language" target="_blank">language acquisition</a>, happens with hardly any structured adult guidance. Compare that with the slog of memorizing conjugation tables and word lists in Spanish class, or your half-finished attempts to learn French on Rosetta Stone or Duolingo. Our painstaking, deliberate attempts to learn language later in life never match the ease of those early childhood years.</p><p>That fascinates Evan Kidd, a psycholinguist at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands. In a 2020 article in the <em>Annual Review of Linguistics</em>, Kidd and colleague Seamus Donnelly <a class="" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-linguistics-011619-030326" target="_blank">explore different theories for why some children acquire their first language faster than others</a>. <em>Knowable Magazine </em>spoke with Kidd about how theories of language acquisition have evolved, what the field has learned and where it’s going next. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p><strong>How did you get into language acquisition and why are you passionate about it?</strong></p><p>I studied psychology as an undergraduate and happened to come across psycholinguistics, and I found the problem of language acquisition really intriguing. Languages are these incredibly complex systems, yet children master them within their first five years. And even before that, as a 3.5- to 4-year-old, they are pretty good at engaging in conversations.</p><p>That became a problem for me to try to explain, though it’s not much of a problem if you’re a child — it’s probably a wonderful thing. But learning a language as an adult is incredibly effortful and error-prone, so it seems that children are pretty privileged language learners. And that’s the hook that made me interested in explaining the developmental processes related to language.</p><p><strong>What are some of the different theories around language acquisition and how have they evolved?</strong></p><aside class="promo -left"><div class="header">You May Also Like</div>

    </aside><p>Well, the influence of <a class="" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstb.1981.0135" target="_blank">Noam Chomsky</a> really is still all over the field. He came up with the idea that language is so complex, and children learn it so rapidly, that children must have innate knowledge about language. That’s an elegant solution to the problem, I suppose, but it’s probably not true.</p><p><strong>And that’s because it’s hard to imagine how a child could have innate knowledge that would apply to all languages, right? That’s a point you make in the review — that any child from anywhere in the world can learn any language.</strong></p><p>Exactly. Chomsky called this the Universal Grammar hypothesis: Children are born with what’s common to all languages across the world. But once you start looking, you start questioning whether there’s a lot that <em>is</em> common to all languages. And so the Universal Grammar hypothesis becomes hollow, because then you’re simply saying things like languages use little bits of sound to create syllables to create words. You’re not coming up with profound conclusions about what could be innate to all languages — such as children having innate knowledge of nouns, verbs and adjectives and how those combine to form sentences.</p><p><strong>It sounds like you’re arguing that a child’s environment is a more important factor. What’s your view of the role of nature versus nurture in language acquisition?</strong></p><p>I think there have to be innate processes that are involved, but I think <em>processes</em> is the key there. We’re born with what I like to think of as a cognitive tool kit. So very early on, as soon as you start hearing speech, you start to process it and then that starts creating knowledge.</p><p>We know, for instance, that children in the womb start to learn aspects of their language from the time the auditory cortex becomes mature. And in our own lab we found that, by around 9 months, kids can be very good at identifying words in running speech. Other people have shown this as well.</p><div class="article-image -caption-center" xml:space="preserve">

          <img alt="A timeline displaying various benchmarks in language development: birth to 3 month (pre-speech); 4 to 6 months (babbling stage); 7 months to 1 year (recognizing common words); 1 year is often when first words are spoken.

        <figcaption><div class="caption"><p>Babies reach a number of major language-learning milestones in their first year. During this time, children also make strides in picking out vowel sounds in their native tongue and recognizing what groups of sounds constitute words.</p></div>
  
          
          
        </figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>How do you know that infants can recognize words if they’re too young to speak? </strong></p><p>We put electrodes on their head to record electrical activity from the scalp. And then we just play them sentences. These are really simple sentences, such as, “The eagle is in the nest.” And 300 milliseconds later, we play “eagle.” And then we compare the response from the electrodes to “eagle” to the response to another word that they haven’t heard. If we get a deviation in the brain activity in response to the new word compared to the replayed word, we infer that they recognize the replayed word.</p><p><strong>Have you ever met a particular child whose language abilities gave you some new insight into language acquisition?</strong></p><p>One of my colleagues and I wrote a <a class="" href="https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2495925_2/component/file_2496119/content" target="_blank">paper</a> years ago on the errors that her daughter was making. Scarlett was saying things like, “I’m are good girl” instead of “I am a good girl.” We analyzed it, and she made these errors only in specific contexts where she said “are” but meant to say “am.” This gave us insight into how she was analyzing the grammar. Scarlett gradually stopped making these errors, but at different rates in different sentences. This suggests that she linked the use of “am” to the specific sentence itself, rather than having a broad command of the use of the verb.</p><p>This is consistent with a learning-based approach to language acquisition, where children learn grammar in a piecemeal fashion, rather than learning the broad rules (for example, be, is, am, are) and quickly generalizing use across a range of contexts. </p><p>Maybe a more common mistake, one that you hear children make a lot, are these overgeneralization errors. Children will say things like, “He hitted me,” or “I sleepded,” and those errors indicate the kinds of analyses that children are making about how to form the past tense. Another one that’s a famous example is children saying, “Don’t giggle me” for “Don’t make me laugh.”</p><div class="article-image -caption-left" xml:space="preserve">

        </figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>How could studying language acquisition in children help adults or kids who lag behind their peers?</strong></p><p>I’m not sure how much it would help an adult learning a new language, except to make them very jealous! I say that as an English speaker now living in the Netherlands. But if we can understand the mechanisms that underlie typical language development, then we might be able to understand how language acquisition is difficult for children with various types of language impairments, such as <a class="" href="https://kids.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frym.2019.00094" target="_blank">developmental language disorder</a>, a common condition in which children struggle to use and understand language. This disorder can have knock-on effects for things like dyslexia. Understanding that typical process means that you can try and develop remediation strategies for children who are behind the normal curve.</p><p><strong>There’s this <a class="" href="https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/TheEarlyCatastrophe.pdf" target="_blank">oft-cited statistic</a> that children in low-socioeconomic background households hear 30 million fewer words by age 4 than their more privileged peers. That finding has since been disputed, but how important do you think the number of words a child hears is?</strong></p><p>Some children are going to do well with 5,000 words a day, some children will do better with 10,000 words a day. But my general guidance is that what is important is the quality of the interaction. A lot of our studies and those of other people have shown that meaningful social engagement with a child is the real basis of early language acquisition. Children’s tendency to engage in conversation with other people, the sort of to and fro of language, is highly predictive of their language development. That basically means sitting down and not talking at them, but with them.</p><p><strong>What are some of the big unknowns in language acquisition, and what’s it going to take to answer them?</strong></p><p>There are a few things that worry me. One is how many of our theories are based on a very small set of languages, yet our theories have to explain how a child could learn any language. We do a lot of research on English or other European languages, but languages can be crazily different in wonderful ways. We need to be able to understand how, say, a child in the Philippines can acquire the complex set of verb systems in Tagalog.</p><p>I also think the frontier of the field will be the integration of neuroscience because, ultimately, it’s our brains that are learning language. Understanding that process may well bring us closer to more psychologically plausible theories of how language is not only learned but represented in the brain. </p><p><strong>Given how easily children pick up languages, are you ever surprised by how hard it is for researchers to understand this process?</strong></p><p>It’s a crazy, silly paradox. We have all these people in linguistics departments building theories of grammar and rarely agreeing, but then a child in any culture can master that grammar very quickly. It’s exciting, humbling and also very annoying that they can do it so well and we can’t explain it! </p>

Immune cells spread beyond infected body parts and start attacking healthy tissues, gobbling up red and white blood cells and damaging the liver. Blood vessel walls open up to let immune cells into surrounding tissues, but the vessels get so leaky that the lungs may fill with fluid, and blood pressure drops. Blood clots throughout the body, further choking blood flow. When organs don’t get enough blood, a person can go into shock, risking permanent organ damage or death.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMost patients experiencing a storm will have a fever, and about half will have some sort of nervous system symptoms, such as headache, seizures or even coma, says Randy Cron, a pediatric rheumatologist and immunologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and co-editor of the 2019 textbook \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030220938\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCytokine Storm Syndrome\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. “They tend to be sicker than you expect,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eDoctors are only now coming to understand cytokine storms and how to treat them, he adds. Though there’s no fail-safe diagnostic test, there are signs that a storm may be underway.

Physicians in Wuhan, in a study of 29 patients, reported that higher levels of the cytokines IL-2R and IL-6 \u003ca href=\\\"https://europepmc.org/article/med/32026671\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ewere found in more severe Covid-19 infections\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20026989v1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eIL-6 was also an early indicator of a cytokine storm-like condition\u003c/a\u003e in an 11-patient analysis by physicians in Guangdong.

Precise data aren’t in yet, but he says that a “sizable fraction” — perhaps 20 to 30 percent — of patients with severe cases and lung symptoms have signs of a cytokine storm.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture is still coming together. “Covid is — maybe — a relatively unique cytokine storm,” Cron says. Blood-clotting rates seem to go beyond those often seen in other storm conditions, but ferritin levels don’t rise to quite the same sky-high levels. In Covid-19, doctors may observe immune cells attacking the lungs so early, and so harshly, that a sort of scar tissue called fibrosis forms. “It seems to happen quickly with this virus.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not the first time a cytokine storm has been linked to a pandemic.

They are finding that exercise is both powerful and wide-reaching, affecting not just muscles and the cardiovascular system, but almost every part of the body, from the immune system to the brain to the energy systems within individual cells. And as scientists understand more precisely which levers exercise pulls to improve our health, clinicians are on the verge of being able to change their practice. The goal is to think of exercise as a medicine — a therapy that they can prescribe in specific doses for specific needs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s like your own personal regenerative medicine,” says Joyner. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBrain gains\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eScientists have long known that some of the benefits of exercise are a simple matter of plumbing. Exercise makes blood vessels bigger and keeps them functioning smoothly, which makes them less likely to plug up and cause a heart attack or stroke. There have been hints that this may also mean more blood flow to the brain, which could help prevent cognitive decline. For example, studies have linked exercise to a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow researchers are making a more explicit connection between exercise and brain health. They are discovering that the full benefit of exercise comes not from mere physical movement but from actual physical fitness, the body’s cardiovascular health.

Bente Klarlund Pedersen, an exercise physiologist at the University of Copenhagen, identified the most-studied of these signaling molecules back in 2000, and later coined a term for them: myokines. Since then, she and other researchers have found hundreds more, many of which are activated by exercise. These molecules, which are released in response to muscular exertion, help regulate muscle growth, nutrient metabolism, inflammation and a host of other processes. “I think for most people it’s difficult to understand why muscle work can influence my liver or be good for my brain or bones,” she says. Myokines serve as the link between muscle activity and these other organs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most important myokines in this crosstalk is interleukin-6. Released in response to muscular exertion, IL-6 has several effects, including \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-019-0174-x\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003esuppressing hunger\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(17)30567-3\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eenhancing the immune system’s response to cancer\u003c/a\u003e.

Several studies already point in this direction. For example, more than half of 64 adults with type 2 diabetes were able to \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2648632\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003estop taking medication to lower their blood sugar\u003c/a\u003e within a year of beginning a regular exercise program, Pedersen and her team found. And a survey of more than 300 randomized controlled trials found that \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5577\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eexercise was just as effective as drugs \u003c/a\u003efor people at risk of heart disease and diabetes, and was more effective than drugs for rehab after a stroke.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut if exercise is to truly become a medicine like any other, clinicians will need to learn how much to prescribe to maximize its benefits. “Just saying ‘be physically active’ is like telling people ‘eat better’ — it doesn’t tell us what we should be doing,” says Kirk Erickson, an exercise psychologist at the University of Pittsburgh. But developing more precise dosing recommendations is difficult, because there are so many ways to exercise, which vary in duration, intensity, frequency and kind. (Tailoring to individual disease risks — telling one person to do \u003cem\u003eX\u003c/em\u003e  because they’re at risk of diabetes, and another person to do \u003cem\u003eY\u003c/em\u003e  because of a family history of dementia — is an even more distant goal.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eResearchers are still working out what matters in this complex arena. Exercises that involve more muscle groups generate more IL-6, so full-body exercises like running have a greater anti-inflammatory effect than exercises that target just a few muscle groups, says Pedersen. And the benefits go away within a couple of days, suggesting that exercising frequently is important. “If it’s been 48 hours since you exercised, it’s time to do it again,” says Jill Barnes, an exercise physiologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA series of upcoming randomized trials may soon bring more certainty to the dosing question. One of the largest, which Bamman is involved with at the University of Alabama, will have nearly 2,000 volunteers undertaking either 12 weeks of endurance exercise, 12 weeks of weight training or no exercise program. Researchers will measure gene activity, molecular signaling and other changes within the body, which could allow them to \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://motrpac.org\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003epin down exactly how these two modes of exercise differ \u003c/a\u003ein effect. Because the study is so large, researchers should also be able to explore why some people respond more strongly than others to the same dose of exercise. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother large study that Bamman is participating in, funded by the US Department of Defense, aims to compare \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03380923\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003egenes activated by moderate exercise to those activated by high-intensity exercise \u003c/a\u003ein young, healthy volunteers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eErickson is trying to parse the specifics with a study that will assess the \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02875301\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eeffect of exercise volume on brain aging\u003c/a\u003e. Researchers will measure inflammation, signaling molecules, body composition and other markers, as well as mental acuity, on more than 600 volunteers ages 65 to 80, both before and after a year of exercise. Some of the volunteers will do 150 minutes per week of supervised moderate exercise, others will do 225 minutes per week, while a third group will do light stretching instead. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, even after the results of these and other forthcoming trials are in, the “right” amount of exercise for a particular person is likely to depend on their individual circumstances. “For someone with diabetes who wants to improve blood-sugar control, even 10 minutes is probably great,” says Barnes. “But for cardiovascular risk or brain health, that may be different.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBamman agrees. “There’s not a single organ system in the body that isn’t affected by exercise,” he says. “Part of the reason the effect of exercise is so consistent and so robust is that there isn’t a single molecular pathway — it’s going to be a combination of all these things. So at the end of all these trials, we’re going to look back and list off not just one or two mechanisms, but a number of them.

Now it’s becoming clear that those known slices don’t add up to the full pie. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“When people totaled up those effects, they only account for about half the benefit,” says Michael Joyner, an exercise physiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “So what’s contributing to the biomedical dark matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003caside class=\\\"promo -left\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"header\\\"\u003eYou May Also Like\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n      \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n\\n      \\n    \u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo solve that mystery, researchers are now digging deeper into the mechanisms that underlie the benefits of physical activity. They are finding that exercise is both powerful and wide-reaching, affecting not just muscles and the cardiovascular system, but almost every part of the body, from the immune system to the brain to the energy systems within individual cells. And as scientists understand more precisely which levers exercise pulls to improve our health, clinicians are on the verge of being able to change their practice. The goal is to think of exercise as a medicine — a therapy that they can prescribe in specific doses for specific needs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s like your own personal regenerative medicine,” says Joyner. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBrain gains\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eScientists have long known that some of the benefits of exercise are a simple matter of plumbing. Exercise makes blood vessels bigger and keeps them functioning smoothly, which makes them less likely to plug up and cause a heart attack or stroke. There have been hints that this may also mean more blood flow to the brain, which could help prevent cognitive decline. For example, studies have linked exercise to a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow researchers are making a more explicit connection between exercise and brain health. They are discovering that the full benefit of exercise comes not from mere physical movement but from actual physical fitness, the body’s cardiovascular health.

That benefits health in a number of ways, from minimizing the risk of diabetes to enhancing the body’s immune response to ills such as cancer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMuscle is the largest consumer of all the glucose that floods into the bloodstream after a meal. More muscle means quicker removal of this glucose surge, says Bamman — and therefore, less exposure to the harm caused by elevated blood sugar, a serious health issue for people prone to diabetes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe muscle-building aspects of exercise also help reverse a key change associated with aging: a decline in the function of mitochondria, our cells’ energy generators. This decline, often seen in sedentary individuals, can leave the mitochondria unable to completely burn the cellular fuel and that can lead cells to generate more oxidants, the oxygen-rich, reactive molecules that damage proteins and DNA. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMuscles are chock-full of mitochondria and exercise can help avoid this oxidative damage. Nair’s studies show that aerobic exercise, alone or in combination with strength training, \u003ca href=\\\"https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/100/4/1654/2815140\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eimproves people’s mitochondrial function\u003c/a\u003e, reduces the production of oxidants and forestalls oxidative damage.

Usually, when other organ systems need amino acids, says Bamman, “those are drawn from muscle.” That’s especially important when someone is sick because the immune system needs lots of amino acids to make antibodies that fight infection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe biggest benefit from building muscle, though, may come from the signaling molecules it pumps into the blood. Bente Klarlund Pedersen, an exercise physiologist at the University of Copenhagen, identified the most-studied of these signaling molecules back in 2000, and later coined a term for them: myokines. Since then, she and other researchers have found hundreds more, many of which are activated by exercise. These molecules, which are released in response to muscular exertion, help regulate muscle growth, nutrient metabolism, inflammation and a host of other processes. “I think for most people it’s difficult to understand why muscle work can influence my liver or be good for my brain or bones,” she says. Myokines serve as the link between muscle activity and these other organs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most important myokines in this crosstalk is interleukin-6. Released in response to muscular exertion, IL-6 has several effects, including \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-019-0174-x\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003esuppressing hunger\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(17)30567-3\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eenhancing the immune system’s response to cancer\u003c/a\u003e.

One reason abdominal fat is so bad for you is its partnership with inflammation. “If we take out visceral fat and study it in the lab, we see that visceral fat is more inflamed than subcutaneous fat,” says Pedersen. “This inflammation will spill over into the blood, causing chronic systemic inflammation.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChronic inflammation, Pedersen suggests in the 2019 \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Physiology\u003c/em\u003e, may be the underlying reason \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-physiol-020518-114339\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ewhy inactivity contributes to so many different diseases\u003c/a\u003e. “We know that being physically inactive increases the risk of approximately 35 different diseases or disorders,” she says. “And if you have one of these diseases — let’s say you have type 2 diabetes — you have increased risk of others, like cancer or heart disease. If we tie it all together, one feature of all these diseases is physical inactivity, and the other is chronic inflammation.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout a decade ago, Pedersen conducted an experiment in which she had healthy young men reduce their daily step count from about 10,000 steps per day to just 1,500. Within two weeks, the men showed a \u003ca href=\\\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/181635\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e7 percent increase in abdominal fat mass\u003c/a\u003e. Along with this change, the men showed hints of reduced insulin sensitivity, a change also seen in type 2 diabetes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterleukin-6 appears to be at the heart of exercise’s effect on visceral fat and inflammation. In a recent experiment, Pedersen and her colleagues put 27 potbellied volunteers on a 12-week exercise-bike program, while 26 other volunteers remained inactive. Half the participants in each group also received a drug that blocks the action of IL-6. At the end of the 12 weeks, the exercisers had lost abdominal fat, as expected — but \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(18)30744-7\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eonly if they had not received the IL-6 blocker\u003c/a\u003e. (Oddly, IL-6 is generally thought of as a pro-inflammatory molecule, because it is more abundant in obese people with systemic inflammation.

Several studies already point in this direction. For example, more than half of 64 adults with type 2 diabetes were able to \u003ca href=\\\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2648632\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003estop taking medication to lower their blood sugar\u003c/a\u003e within a year of beginning a regular exercise program, Pedersen and her team found.

But developing more precise dosing recommendations is difficult, because there are so many ways to exercise, which vary in duration, intensity, frequency and kind. (Tailoring to individual disease risks — telling one person to do \u003cem\u003eX\u003c/em\u003e  because they’re at risk of diabetes, and another person to do \u003cem\u003eY\u003c/em\u003e  because of a family history of dementia — is an even more distant goal.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eResearchers are still working out what matters in this complex arena. Exercises that involve more muscle groups generate more IL-6, so full-body exercises like running have a greater anti-inflammatory effect than exercises that target just a few muscle groups, says Pedersen. And the benefits go away within a couple of days, suggesting that exercising frequently is important. “If it’s been 48 hours since you exercised, it’s time to do it again,” says Jill Barnes, an exercise physiologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA series of upcoming randomized trials may soon bring more certainty to the dosing question. One of the largest, which Bamman is involved with at the University of Alabama, will have nearly 2,000 volunteers undertaking either 12 weeks of endurance exercise, 12 weeks of weight training or no exercise program. Researchers will measure gene activity, molecular signaling and other changes within the body, which could allow them to \u003ca href=\\\"https://motrpac.org\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003epin down exactly how these two modes of exercise differ \u003c/a\u003ein effect.

Researchers will measure inflammation, signaling molecules, body composition and other markers, as well as mental acuity, on more than 600 volunteers ages 65 to 80, both before and after a year of exercise. Some of the volunteers will do 150 minutes per week of supervised moderate exercise, others will do 225 minutes per week, while a third group will do light stretching instead. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, even after the results of these and other forthcoming trials are in, the “right” amount of exercise for a particular person is likely to depend on their individual circumstances. “For someone with diabetes who wants to improve blood-sugar control, even 10 minutes is probably great,” says Barnes. “But for cardiovascular risk or brain health, that may be different.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBamman agrees. “There’s not a single organ system in the body that isn’t affected by exercise,” he says. “Part of the reason the effect of exercise is so consistent and so robust is that there isn’t a single molecular pathway — it’s going to be a combination of all these things.

Medicine traditionally is guided by a patient’s physical symptoms and measurable changes to physiology — what biologists call the phenotype. Integrating genetic data — a patient’s genotype — into these deliberations could help tailor treatments to boost their effectiveness, or even identify people at higher risk of developing a given disease, who could be offered help earlier. But to make that work, scientists need to connect the dots: match genotype to phenotype, find patterns and connections in the way people’s DNA varies and the way their health does, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose connections are becoming clearer. In February this year, for example, scientists found genetic markers in the biobank data that \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25431\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003elinked high cholesterol to the development of motor neuron disease\u003c/a\u003e. Cholesterol-lowering drugs like statins, the results suggest, might prevent this deadly and incurable condition. Last month, a different team combed through the genetics of 334,000 of the half-million people signed up to the biobank project to identify genes associated with problematic metabolism of uric acid, which causes health problems including the painful condition gout. From head to toe, month by month scientists are using the biobank information to reveal everything from the benefits of being left-handed to the genetic basis for hearing loss and the damage that diabetes can do to the heart.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe UK project isn’t the first to recruit volunteers to identify links between genes and disease. National efforts are also under way in Estonia, Sweden, Iceland, China and Mexico. And back in the 1990s, the Icelandic company \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.decode.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003edeCODE\u003c/a\u003e set out to build a database of the genes they found in the country’s population.

Access. Other biobanks set up around the world are useful projects that can help answer some specific questions, Denny says. But it’s often difficult for outside scientists to get access to the data. Some national projects guard their secrets from foreign eyes as a way to give their own researchers a head start.

(Indeed, the carefully preserved samples at the Manchester HQ now represent the earthly remains of at least 20,000 volunteers who have since passed away.) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eParticipants weren’t paid and had to spend hours at one of several regional centers, where they surrendered blood and urine, had their health examined and filled in surveys on their habits and lifestyle. As a result, the biobank population is not as diverse as geneticists might like, Collins admits, especially if the results are supposed to be useful around the world. Some 94 percent of people the biobank signed up are white, and certain socioeconomic groups, including young, low-income white men, are underrepresented.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInitially, the blood samples were analyzed for simple variations in genetic sequence, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms.

That fulfilled the original plan, but as genetic sequencing has become faster and cheaper, other researchers wanted to go further — some of them in private companies. In 2017, the drug firms GSK and Regeneron offered to sequence the “exome” of 50,000 UK Biobank participants. This gives a readout of the sections of DNA that actually code for proteins, and is seen as a more powerful way to locate useful information that could be used to develop medicines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe companies agreed to pay the bill, but wanted something in return: exclusive access to the data. They were given 6 to 12 months, then earlier this year the information was released to the wider scientific community. A larger group of pharma companies is now working on exome sequences for the remaining 450,000 volunteers under the same arrangement, with the data due to be fully released next year. The total cost of the exome sequencing — paid for by the commercial firms — will be $150 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s a sensible and pragmatic way for publicly funded science to work with commercial companies, says cognitive epidemiologist \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/simon-cox\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eSimon Cox\u003c/a\u003e, who uses UK Biobank data to study cognitive aging at the University of Edinburgh. “It’s not necessarily ideal,” he says. “But if this is the model we have to adopt to get this stuff done then I don’t think it’s spectacularly untoward.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCox recently published a study that exploits another extension of the biobank’s original goals. In April 2016, organizers started to invite thousands of the participants back to take detailed MRI scans of their bodies, brains and other organs and add them to the database. Some 40,000 of the original volunteers have been scanned this way so far, and the project wants to make that 100,000 by 2022. Some of these volunteers also agreed to take a battery of psychological tests when they returned — to probe reasoning and intelligence with questions not asked in the original assessment. Cox and his colleagues took advantage of this to revisit one of the most controversial historic questions in psychology: \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/599472v1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eDoes a bigger brain make someone smarter?\u003c/a\u003e (Spoiler: It does, but not much.)

At a stroke, Cox says, the biobank’s massive numbers address one of the strongest criticisms of findings based on MRI scans — that they include too few people to give reliable results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s the biggest dataset there is,” says \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/lisa-nobis\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eLisa Nobis\u003c/a\u003e, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford.

The plan is to produce a reference tool of normal hippocampus size for different age groups that future clinicians can use to spot problems earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s the kind of study, Nobis says, that can only be done with a very large sample size. Scientists’ attempts to boost numbers of brains by combining results from sets of smaller MRI studies run into their own set of problems: Technical differences between the way scans are done in different centers often make it difficult to meaningfully compare them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe investment in MRI scanners and other shiny, new pieces of equipment gives the Manchester headquarters of the biobank the air of a wealthy private hospital. Elderly volunteers are helped along its spotless wide corridors and shuttled among different scanners, depending on the level of tissue detail required. In one room, staff are preparing to take ultrasound scans of the thickness of the wall of a patient’s carotid arteries. Again, it’s a measurement that is being taken because it can be, rather than because there’s a solid scientific or medical need for the data at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe scientists hope this type of basic anatomical information will be useful one day in the future — especially as the biobank database links to details about hospital admissions, treatments and surgery held in the electronic records of Britain’s National Health Service and aims to expand the links to even more granular clinical information about complaints, symptoms and prescriptions held in primary care health records of thousands of doctors’ offices. According to biobank staff, most volunteers realize that the data gathered from them and others is unlikely to benefit them directly, but they say they hope it will help future generations, either of their own family or someone else’s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne such volunteer is Irene Soulsby, a 61-year-old from Newcastle upon Tyne, in northeast England, who is happy to disclose and talk about her involvement.

Soulsby enrolled in 2008 and did so, she says, because she had previously benefited from successful treatment for cancer, which she knew was based on prior medical research. “I’m here because somebody’s done this for me,” she says. There is another motive too: Given her history, she welcomes the extra tests and ongoing scrutiny of her health. “It’s an amazing resource and I’m really proud to be part of it,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-left\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg alt=\\\"Photograph of a woman in a white jacket feeding a shaggy horse in a field.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/376/P-irene-soulsby_0.jpg\\\" title=\\\"Irene Soulsby\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n        \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eIrene Soulsby takes a walk in a park near her home town of Newcastle upon Tyne.

Before it even got off the ground, a 2003 editorial in the leading medical journal the \u003cem\u003eLancet\u003c/em\u003e voiced skepticism. It called the UK Biobank “\u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)13377-6/fulltext\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ea project in search of a protocol\u003c/a\u003e” that many researchers in Britain saw “as an ill-conceived, politically motivated project, in which consultations have only been done to give an appearance of legitimacy and in which the scientific case has not been made for its design.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd despite the apparent success and cranking up of the scientific output — more than 270 research papers appeared in 2018 alone based on UK Biobank data — such criticisms have not gone away entirely. \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://bio.psu.edu/directory/kmw4\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eKenneth Weiss\u003c/a\u003e is an emeritus professor of anthropology and genetics at Pennsylvania State University and a long-standing critic of mega-genomics projects based on the promise of big data. “There is a need for skepticism.

Having swallowed more than $250 million so far, the UK project is certainly an expensive option, and much of the burden is carried by UK taxpayers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs with all medical studies, the biobank results are only as strong as the data and assumptions they rest on. And in October, scientists discovered a flaw in a biobank analysis that proved fatal for the high-profile study that was based on it. A technical glitch led to the biobank undercounting how many older people carried a specific mutation in the \u003cem\u003eCCR5\u003c/em\u003e gene that confers resistance to HIV. Researchers used this as evidence in a paper that concluded that carrying this mutation could shorten people’s lives.

When participants sign up for the project, they do so without knowing exactly what will be done with the information they provide. Soulsby says she trusts the project officials to use it properly, but not everybody is happy with the arrangement. Traditionally, scientific research projects ask for explicit consent from volunteers after outlining exactly how the samples or data they provide will be used. The broad spectrum of research that blossoms from a biobank project make this impractical, so a more general type of “open consent” is used instead, under which volunteers essentially give blanket and open-ended approval for their samples to be used however project organizers deem fit, even after their own deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a critical essay published in 2017 in the journal \u003cem\u003ePLOS Biology\u003c/em\u003e, law and ethics experts Timothy Caulfield and Blake Murdoch, of the University of Alberta, Canada, \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002654\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eargued that this isn’t good enough\u003c/a\u003e. “There remains a deep lack of clarity around basic legal and ethical principles,” they wrote of UK Biobank and projects like it. “The international research community has built a massive and diverse research infrastructure on a foundation that has the potential, however slight, to collapse, in bits or altogether.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne issue that Caulfield and Murdock highlight is what lawyers call the “rights of control.” It’s possible for example, that participants, or their families, could seek payment for profitable outcomes, or even challenge the use of their data for specific projects they disagree with. And there could be more to disagree with than one might expect. The project was sold as a biomedicine effort — and the terms of the UK Biobank open consent process ask volunteers to agree to vague-sounding “health-related research purposes” — but some of the research does stretch the definition of what many people might think of as medicine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEarlier this year, for example, an international team of researchers used the biobank data to show how genetic variants associated with lower educational attainment and lower socioeconomic status bunched together in former coal-mining districts of the UK, a report that raised concerns among some in the field.

Some worry that the broad nature of the research done with the samples makes it impossible for volunteers to give proper consent. And in October, a high-profile paper was withdrawn because of technical problems in the way biobank data were analyzed. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut to scientists like Denny, the promise is clear. “This is a resource for the world,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMaking the genetic connection\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe principle behind the UK Biobank is ambitious: to link health outcomes to the genetic data that pour from DNA sequencing machines across the world. Medicine traditionally is guided by a patient’s physical symptoms and measurable changes to physiology — what biologists call the phenotype. Integrating genetic data — a patient’s genotype — into these deliberations could help tailor treatments to boost their effectiveness, or even identify people at higher risk of developing a given disease, who could be offered help earlier. But to make that work, scientists need to connect the dots: match genotype to phenotype, find patterns and connections in the way people’s DNA varies and the way their health does, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose connections are becoming clearer. In February this year, for example, scientists found genetic markers in the biobank data that \u003ca href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25431\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003elinked high cholesterol to the development of motor neuron disease\u003c/a\u003e. Cholesterol-lowering drugs like statins, the results suggest, might prevent this deadly and incurable condition. Last month, a different team combed through the genetics of 334,000 of the half-million people signed up to the biobank project to identify genes associated with problematic metabolism of uric acid, which causes health problems including the painful condition gout. From head to toe, month by month scientists are using the biobank information to reveal everything from the benefits of being left-handed to the genetic basis for hearing loss and the damage that diabetes can do to the heart.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe UK project isn’t the first to recruit volunteers to identify links between genes and disease. National efforts are also under way in Estonia, Sweden, Iceland, China and Mexico. And back in the 1990s, the Icelandic company \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.decode.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003edeCODE\u003c/a\u003e set out to build a database of the genes they found in the country’s population. Analysis of the Icelandic data, now owned by the US biopharmaceutical giant Amgen, continues — for example, the company is now working on medicines to mimic the heart-protecting effects of a gene variant carried by one in 120 Icelanders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven with its high volunteer numbers, the UK Biobank isn’t the largest project of its type either. The British effort can call on data from some 500,000 recruits — but, as it often does, the US military has gone further. In April, the US \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eMillion Veterans Program\u003c/a\u003e signed up its 750,000th participant since it began in 2011, and still wants more to reach its eponymous goal. The MVP screens the health and genomes of veterans to probe the genetics of post-traumatic stress disorder, diabetes, heart disease, suicide prevention and other topics of particular relevance to that community. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, what’s so great about Great Britain’s project? Access. Other biobanks set up around the world are useful projects that can help answer some specific questions, Denny says. But it’s often difficult for outside scientists to get access to the data. Some national projects guard their secrets from foreign eyes as a way to give their own researchers a head start. Others fret about privacy and losing the trust of participants if they were to start sharing their information more widely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe UK Biobank is unique because open and free data access for everyone was the plan from day one, says \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/team/rory-collins\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eRory Collins\u003c/a\u003e, an epidemiologist at the University of Oxford and chief executive of the UK Biobank project. “We wanted to build something, a resource, in the same way as they built CERN,” the European particle physics lab near Geneva, he says. “This wasn’t a grant application which has to have a specific hypothesis.” It’s a point that other people attached to the Biobank project make repeatedly: This is a basic science project. If they built it, they thought that scientists would come and want to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey have come, and continue to do so. At last count, 13,000 scientists in 77 countries, from Australia and Malaysia to Russia and Jordan, have been given access to data on topics from cognition and sleep to mental health.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMarshaling money and volunteers\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrompted by a call from British scientists to invest in the promise of DNA, the biobank started life as a funding pledge from Tony Blair’s new Labour government in 1998. Backed by the Medical Research Council, a state funder, and the Wellcome Trust, a biomedical charity, the project was based on the principles of the famous \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eFramingham Heart Study\u003c/a\u003e, an influential population cohort study that followed 5,200 residents of Framingham, Massachusetts, as a way to find factors that influence cardiac illness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe UK started to recruit volunteers to its study in 2006 and reached its half-million goal four years later. It focused on individuals ages 40 to 69 because organizers figured it would be most useful to study older people, who tend to more quickly show the signs of ill health that researchers are interested in. (Indeed, the carefully preserved samples at the Manchester HQ now represent the earthly remains of at least 20,000 volunteers who have since passed away.) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eParticipants weren’t paid and had to spend hours at one of several regional centers, where they surrendered blood and urine, had their health examined and filled in surveys on their habits and lifestyle. As a result, the biobank population is not as diverse as geneticists might like, Collins admits, especially if the results are supposed to be useful around the world. Some 94 percent of people the biobank signed up are white, and certain socioeconomic groups, including young, low-income white men, are underrepresented.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInitially, the blood samples were analyzed for simple variations in genetic sequence, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms. These single base-pair changes in DNA occur at specific places in the genome and can explain traits such as eye color and inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia. They also act as markers to indicate risk of complex diseases, including diabetes and Alzheimer’s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first of these genotyping data were made available for a group of 150,000 biobank participants in May 2015. Results from the other 350,000 people were added two years later. That fulfilled the original plan, but as genetic sequencing has become faster and cheaper, other researchers wanted to go further — some of them in private companies. In 2017, the drug firms GSK and Regeneron offered to sequence the “exome” of 50,000 UK Biobank participants. This gives a readout of the sections of DNA that actually code for proteins, and is seen as a more powerful way to locate useful information that could be used to develop medicines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe companies agreed to pay the bill, but wanted something in return: exclusive access to the data. They were given 6 to 12 months, then earlier this year the information was released to the wider scientific community. A larger group of pharma companies is now working on exome sequences for the remaining 450,000 volunteers under the same arrangement, with the data due to be fully released next year. The total cost of the exome sequencing — paid for by the commercial firms — will be $150 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s a sensible and pragmatic way for publicly funded science to work with commercial companies, says cognitive epidemiologist \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/simon-cox\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eSimon Cox\u003c/a\u003e, who uses UK Biobank data to study cognitive aging at the University of Edinburgh. “It’s not necessarily ideal,” he says. “But if this is the model we have to adopt to get this stuff done then I don’t think it’s spectacularly untoward.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCox recently published a study that exploits another extension of the biobank’s original goals. In April 2016, organizers started to invite thousands of the participants back to take detailed MRI scans of their bodies, brains and other organs and add them to the database. Some 40,000 of the original volunteers have been scanned this way so far, and the project wants to make that 100,000 by 2022. Some of these volunteers also agreed to take a battery of psychological tests when they returned — to probe reasoning and intelligence with questions not asked in the original assessment. Cox and his colleagues took advantage of this to revisit one of the most controversial historic questions in psychology: \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/599472v1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eDoes a bigger brain make someone smarter?\u003c/a\u003e (Spoiler: It does, but not much.) Particularly important, the research showed, is the structure of white matter and the relative size of individual regions such as parts of the frontal cortex.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo do this analysis, the scientists compared the test scores and brain volumes of more than 18,000 people — way more than had ever been gathered for such a study before. At a stroke, Cox says, the biobank’s massive numbers address one of the strongest criticisms of findings based on MRI scans — that they include too few people to give reliable results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s the biggest dataset there is,” says \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/lisa-nobis\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eLisa Nobis\u003c/a\u003e, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford. And it shows the way that science is going. “When MRI first came out, you could get a paper in  \u003cem\u003eNature\u003c/em\u003e or  \u003cem\u003eScience\u003c/em\u003e with just 15 people. But in the last few years, studies have shown that less than 50 people is not reliable at all” as a general rule. She is using the biobank scans to build up a picture of how the brain’s  \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/562678v1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ehippocampus shrinks with age\u003c/a\u003e and with dementia. The plan is to produce a reference tool of normal hippocampus size for different age groups that future clinicians can use to spot problems earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s the kind of study, Nobis says, that can only be done with a very large sample size. Scientists’ attempts to boost numbers of brains by combining results from sets of smaller MRI studies run into their own set of problems: Technical differences between the way scans are done in different centers often make it difficult to meaningfully compare them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe investment in MRI scanners and other shiny, new pieces of equipment gives the Manchester headquarters of the biobank the air of a wealthy private hospital. Elderly volunteers are helped along its spotless wide corridors and shuttled among different scanners, depending on the level of tissue detail required. In one room, staff are preparing to take ultrasound scans of the thickness of the wall of a patient’s carotid arteries. Again, it’s a measurement that is being taken because it can be, rather than because there’s a solid scientific or medical need for the data at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe scientists hope this type of basic anatomical information will be useful one day in the future — especially as the biobank database links to details about hospital admissions, treatments and surgery held in the electronic records of Britain’s National Health Service and aims to expand the links to even more granular clinical information about complaints, symptoms and prescriptions held in primary care health records of thousands of doctors’ offices. According to biobank staff, most volunteers realize that the data gathered from them and others is unlikely to benefit them directly, but they say they hope it will help future generations, either of their own family or someone else’s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne such volunteer is Irene Soulsby, a 61-year-old from Newcastle upon Tyne, in northeast England, who is happy to disclose and talk about her involvement. (The biobank promises confidentiality, if preferred.) Soulsby enrolled in 2008 and did so, she says, because she had previously benefited from successful treatment for cancer, which she knew was based on prior medical research. “I’m here because somebody’s done this for me,” she says. There is another motive too: Given her history, she welcomes the extra tests and ongoing scrutiny of her health. “It’s an amazing resource and I’m really proud to be part of it,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFrom the start, some skepticism\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe broad scope of the project was not always viewed as an asset. Before it even got off the ground, a 2003 editorial in the leading medical journal the \u003cem\u003eLancet\u003c/em\u003e voiced skepticism. It called the UK Biobank “ \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)13377-6/fulltext\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ea project in search of a protocol\u003c/a\u003e” that many researchers in Britain saw “as an ill-conceived, politically motivated project, in which consultations have only been done to give an appearance of legitimacy and in which the scientific case has not been made for its design.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd despite the apparent success and cranking up of the scientific output — more than 270 research papers appeared in 2018 alone based on UK Biobank data — such criticisms have not gone away entirely. \u003ca href=\\\"https://bio.psu.edu/directory/kmw4\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eKenneth Weiss\u003c/a\u003e is an emeritus professor of anthropology and genetics at Pennsylvania State University and a long-standing critic of mega-genomics projects based on the promise of big data. “There is a need for skepticism. There are better ways to find and document the complex causation of genetics than this open-ended genomic approach,” he says. Having swallowed more than $250 million so far, the UK project is certainly an expensive option, and much of the burden is carried by UK taxpayers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs with all medical studies, the biobank results are only as strong as the data and assumptions they rest on. And in October, scientists discovered a flaw in a biobank analysis that proved fatal for the high-profile study that was based on it. A technical glitch led to the biobank undercounting how many older people carried a specific mutation in the  \u003cem\u003eCCR5\u003c/em\u003e gene that confers resistance to HIV. Researchers used this as evidence in a paper that concluded that carrying this mutation could shorten people’s lives. The finding was significant because this is the genetic change the Chinese scientist  \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07545-0\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eHe Jiankui\u003c/a\u003e claimed to have deliberately introduced to twin baby girls in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe paper was retracted, but genetic experts who reanalyzed the data said the problem was a one-off that doesn’t undermine other studies using biobank data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are also concerns about ethics and consent. When participants sign up for the project, they do so without knowing exactly what will be done with the information they provide. Soulsby says she trusts the project officials to use it properly, but not everybody is happy with the arrangement. Traditionally, scientific research projects ask for explicit consent from volunteers after outlining exactly how the samples or data they provide will be used. The broad spectrum of research that blossoms from a biobank project make this impractical, so a more general type of “open consent” is used instead, under which volunteers essentially give blanket and open-ended approval for their samples to be used however project organizers deem fit, even after their own deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a critical essay published in 2017 in the journal \u003cem\u003ePLOS Biology\u003c/em\u003e, law and ethics experts Timothy Caulfield and Blake Murdoch, of the University of Alberta, Canada,  \u003ca href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002654\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eargued that this isn’t good enough\u003c/a\u003e. “There remains a deep lack of clarity around basic legal and ethical principles,” they wrote of UK Biobank and projects like it. “The international research community has built a massive and diverse research infrastructure on a foundation that has the potential, however slight, to collapse, in bits or altogether.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne issue that Caulfield and Murdock highlight is what lawyers call the “rights of control.” It’s possible for example, that participants, or their families, could seek payment for profitable outcomes, or even challenge the use of their data for specific projects they disagree with. And there could be more to disagree with than one might expect. The project was sold as a biomedicine effort — and the terms of the UK Biobank open consent process ask volunteers to agree to vague-sounding “health-related research purposes” — but some of the research does stretch the definition of what many people might think of as medicine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEarlier this year, for example, an international team of researchers used the biobank data to show how genetic variants associated with lower educational attainment and lower socioeconomic status bunched together in former coal-mining districts of the UK, a report that raised concerns among some in the field. Such analyses are controversial because they attempt to extend the links between genotype and phenotype from medical traits to complex — and contested — social behaviors and values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1487\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ePeter Visscher\u003c/a\u003e, a geneticist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, who worked on the study, says it does have a strong link to health — and that’s why the UK Biobank officials approved it. The genetic patterns on educational attainment that the team analyzed closely associate with risk of conditions like coronary heart disease and schizophrenia, he says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGenes, lifestyle, environment, health, social values, behavior: Scientists across the world are using the biobank data to help piece together and sort out the complexity of what makes people — of Britain, of Iceland, of the US military, and of the world — tick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s a collaborative effort, and the UK project — and UK science — is playing its part.

One: Males must be competing over either resources such as food or over females. Two: It’s possible for access to those resources to successfully be guarded. And three: Males of the species compete in one-on-one duels.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut the fighting is almost never to the death and rarely results in serious wounds. Scientists say that this supports the idea that these weapons are built for rivalry — their designs optimized not for destruction but for power struggles. Indeed, variation in the size of male weaponry is huge, Emlen notes: While overall body size among adult male elk might vary by a factor of 2 at most, their antler racks can vary by a factor of more than 30, he says. And the most dazzling weapons act largely as deterrents, with actual fights breaking out only when males are closely matched.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eWeapons for show\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAs the weapons grow bigger and flashier, they come with the cost of producing and lugging around such big structures. (And sometimes other costs: Male fiddler crabs can only stuff algae in their mouths with one claw.) Studies show that the weapons’ sizes are sensitive to nutrition, parasite load, stress and overall physical condition — and so the healthiest, most fit individuals sport the most impressive weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers consider these ostentatious male weapons to be honest signals — \u003ca href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jez.1961\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eadvertising the owner’s might\u003c/a\u003e and fitness accurately.

Some will cruise an area of multiple male burrows and size up the weapons being waved at them, among other things, before selecting a mate. “We don’t know what the female’s thinking, but she’s taking into account a bunch of complicated information,” Swanson says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThough scientists believe that the primary role for these animal weapons is in reproduction, there are cases in which the weapons also serve as deterrents or defenses against predators — likely as an evolutionary bonus. Elk antlers are a case in point. Unlike many other North American species in the deer family, elk hang onto their antlers until March, long after the mating season has ended in October. When Matt Metz, a PhD student at the University of Montana, and his colleagues tracked wolf kills in Yellowstone National Park they found that during March, \u003ca href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0657-5\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ewolves are three to four times more likely to attack an antlerless male elk\u003c/a\u003e than one still wearing his rack.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSince elk rarely use the antlers in defense, preferring to rear up and kick predators with their front hooves, presumably the structures serve as deterrents, Metz says. Yet if antler weapons had evolved primarily as a defense against predators, it wouldn’t make sense to shed them at all, he adds — and females should have them, too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eEmbellishments and frills\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWhy nature came up with such a bizarre array of weapon shapes and forms remains a bit of a mystery. But as a general rule, Swanson says, evolution tended to exaggerate structures already in existence. Crabs and lobsters have pincer claws that over evolutionary time became enlarged. And arthropods (spiders, insects and crustaceans) have exoskeletons that genetic changes could sculpt to form projections such as the horns or giant mandibles seen in beetles.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWeapons also are probably molded by the type of fighting and where it’s done — as borne out by work on the shapes of rhinoceros beetle horns by evolutionary biologist Erin McCullough. As a graduate student with Emlen, she spent two summers in Taiwan videotaping battles of the Japanese horned beetle, which has a pitchfork-shaped horn. She compared its fights to those of the Hercules beetle, which sports thick, pinching horns, and a species of Golofa beetle, which has thinner, sword-like horns. Each fights in slightly different ways, all with the goal of flicking their opponent off a tree branch or bamboo shoot.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-video -full-width\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"video-container\\\"\u003e\u003ciframe allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2I2yc_OeoU\\\" width=\\\"560\\\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-video-caption\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eTwo Hercules beetles (\u003cem\u003eDynastes hercules\u003c/em\u003e) battle it out.

An example is seen in the horns and frills of the triceratops, a type of ceratopsid dinosaur — big-bodied herbivores that lived in large herds in open spaces, not unlike caribou. “They had the biggest skulls of land-living animals that ever lived, partly due to these big bony structures on their heads,” says Scott Sampson, paleontologist and executive director of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it’s tricky to study dinosaur behavior, or even determine a skeleton’s sex, from fossils. Paleontologists continue to debate whether such unusual face decor was used to help dinosaur species recognize their own kind, for male-male mating contests or signals to females, or for defense. But Sampson says several lines of evidence persuade him that these horns were sexual weapons or displays rather than spears to fend off predators.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eImportantly, these features weren’t fully grown until the animals reached adult size and reproductive age. And many of the features of dinosaur horns, spikes and frills were “lousy” as weapons against carnivorous predators, Sampson says. Some were thin to the point of fragility or curved in seemingly the wrong direction.

Biologists say that these fantastic shapes — from the giant curved tusks of woolly mammoths to the nightmarish jaws of stag beetles — evolved to ward off competition from rival males and to impress females.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003caside class=\\\"promo -left\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"header\\\"\u003eYou May Also Like\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eExamples of such sexually selected weapons abound throughout the animal kingdom in insects, fish, crustaceans, reptiles and mammals as varied as narwhal, rhinoceros and moose. Even extinct species such as trilobites and dinosaurs sported elaborate projections. The number and variety of examples argue that evolution has turned to weaponry time and again in the race to reproduce successfully.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s such a common theme that Emlen had to persuade his editors to include seven detailed, full-page line drawings in a survey of nature’s weapons that he wrote for the 2008 \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.39.110707.173502\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, featuring more than 280 examples of fantastical spikes, horns, antlers, pincers, tusks, claws, extended jaws, saws and spears. The illustration above offers a taste.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eScientists still debate the degree to which female choice plays a role in shaping the weapons’ flair and are still trying to figure out what factors drive the diversity of weapon forms seen among even closely related species. But it’s clear that the wild array of weapons evolved to aid successful mating.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eFighting for females\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLike the structures, types of combat vary greatly. Rhinoceros beetles, named for their rhino-like horns, guard access to the oozes of tree sap that females feed upon before laying eggs. Rival males size each other up, and if their horns’ sizes are similarly matched, a face-off ensues and each uses his horns to try to flip, pry and toss his rival off the tree branch.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMost species of male fiddler crabs guard their burrows, where mating takes place. Dueling males shove and tap on each other’s single, enlarged claw — and, should the fight escalate, they lock claws, secret-handshake style, as if they’re testing the other’s strength. If one decides he has the upper hand, he flings his opponent away from the burrow.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe fearsome weapons seem to evolve whenever three criteria are met, Emlen says. One: Males must be competing over either resources such as food or over females. Two: It’s possible for access to those resources to successfully be guarded. And three: Males of the species compete in one-on-one duels.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut the fighting is almost never to the death and rarely results in serious wounds. Scientists say that this supports the idea that these weapons are built for rivalry — their designs optimized not for destruction but for power struggles. Indeed, variation in the size of male weaponry is huge, Emlen notes: While overall body size among adult male elk might vary by a factor of 2 at most, their antler racks can vary by a factor of more than 30, he says. And the most dazzling weapons act largely as deterrents, with actual fights breaking out only when males are closely matched.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eWeapons for show\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAs the weapons grow bigger and flashier, they come with the cost of producing and lugging around such big structures. (And sometimes other costs: Male fiddler crabs can only stuff algae in their mouths with one claw.) Studies show that the weapons’ sizes are sensitive to nutrition, parasite load, stress and overall physical condition — and so the healthiest, most fit individuals sport the most impressive weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers consider these ostentatious male weapons to be honest signals — \u003ca href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jez.1961\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eadvertising the owner’s might\u003c/a\u003e and fitness accurately. And not just physical fitness. A study of nearly 200 Iberian red deer stags measured the size and complexity of the animals’ antlers and found that \u003ca href=\\\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2004.2933\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ebigger and more elaborate racks correlated with both bigger testes and faster-swimming sperm\u003c/a\u003e. From that and other evidence, many biologists think that bigger weapons can advertise reproductive superiority, too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while Emlen believes that male weapons evolved primarily for the purposes of male-male rivalry battles, comparative physiologist Brook Swanson of Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, argues that those signals are almost certainly also being assessed by females choosing mates. “Even if a male could beat up all the other males, females almost always have a choice among mates,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eTake those fiddler crabs. Males of more than 100 species of the crabs have enlarged claws, \u003ca href=\\\"https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/65/1/83/5050399\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eand research suggests that the females can be picky\u003c/a\u003e. Some will cruise an area of multiple male burrows and size up the weapons being waved at them, among other things, before selecting a mate. “We don’t know what the female’s thinking, but she’s taking into account a bunch of complicated information,” Swanson says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThough scientists believe that the primary role for these animal weapons is in reproduction, there are cases in which the weapons also serve as deterrents or defenses against predators — likely as an evolutionary bonus. Elk antlers are a case in point. Unlike many other North American species in the deer family, elk hang onto their antlers until March, long after the mating season has ended in October. When Matt Metz, a PhD student at the University of Montana, and his colleagues tracked wolf kills in Yellowstone National Park they found that during March, \u003ca href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0657-5\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ewolves are three to four times more likely to attack an antlerless male elk\u003c/a\u003e than one still wearing his rack.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSince elk rarely use the antlers in defense, preferring to rear up and kick predators with their front hooves, presumably the structures serve as deterrents, Metz says. Yet if antler weapons had evolved primarily as a defense against predators, it wouldn’t make sense to shed them at all, he adds — and females should have them, too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eEmbellishments and frills\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWhy nature came up with such a bizarre array of weapon shapes and forms remains a bit of a mystery. But as a general rule, Swanson says, evolution tended to exaggerate structures already in existence. Crabs and lobsters have pincer claws that over evolutionary time became enlarged. And arthropods (spiders, insects and crustaceans) have exoskeletons that genetic changes could sculpt to form projections such as the horns or giant mandibles seen in beetles.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWeapons also are probably molded by the type of fighting and where it’s done — as borne out by work on the shapes of rhinoceros beetle horns by evolutionary biologist Erin McCullough. As a graduate student with Emlen, she spent two summers in Taiwan videotaping battles of the Japanese horned beetle, which has a pitchfork-shaped horn. She compared its fights to those of the Hercules beetle, which sports thick, pinching horns, and a species of Golofa beetle, which has thinner, sword-like horns. Each fights in slightly different ways, all with the goal of flicking their opponent off a tree branch or bamboo shoot.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMcCullough, now a postdoctoral researcher at Syracuse University in New York, first measured how much force was needed to dislodge an average-size male from a branch. Next, she CT-scanned the critters’ horns, built 3-D computer models of the structures and used engineering tools to calculate the stresses and strains that the structures could withstand. She found that \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.pnas.org/content/111/40/14484\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eeach horn performed best under the forces of its species-specific fighting style\u003c/a\u003e. “This is a big component for why different species have different weapons,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn October, an international group of researchers used the same computer modeling techniques to suggest \u003ca href=\\\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2019.1873\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ethat the largest antlers ever to exist\u003c/a\u003e — the 12-feet-across by 5-feet-high rack of the prehistoric Irish elk — \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/giant-antlers-deer.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ewere used for male sparring, too\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut McCullough notes that the scariest, showiest weapons are not always very lethal. Some diversity, such as curlicues and extra tines, is probably driven by the display functions of weapons, she says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eHorn-y dinosaur courtship\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the largest animal weapons ever found adorned dinosaur heads. An example is seen in the horns and frills of the triceratops, a type of ceratopsid dinosaur — big-bodied herbivores that lived in large herds in open spaces, not unlike caribou. “They had the biggest skulls of land-living animals that ever lived, partly due to these big bony structures on their heads,” says Scott Sampson, paleontologist and executive director of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it’s tricky to study dinosaur behavior, or even determine a skeleton’s sex, from fossils. Paleontologists continue to debate whether such unusual face decor was used to help dinosaur species recognize their own kind, for male-male mating contests or signals to females, or for defense. But Sampson says several lines of evidence persuade him that these horns were sexual weapons or displays rather than spears to fend off predators.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eImportantly, these features weren’t fully grown until the animals reached adult size and reproductive age. And many of the features of dinosaur horns, spikes and frills were “lousy” as weapons against carnivorous predators, Sampson says. Some were thin to the point of fragility or curved in seemingly the wrong direction. Take, for example, \u003ca href=\\\"http://www.eartharchives.org/articles/weird-fossil-of-the-week-kosmoceratops/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eKosmoceratops\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a flamboyant fossil \u003ca href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012292\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003efound in southern Utah\u003c/a\u003e that sported 15 horns on its face, the top of its skull and its bony frill, some of which curve back on themselves. “I’m quite certain this pattern is all about show,” Sampson says.

But beauty, we know, is only skin-deep. Inside the human body, asymmetries abound. The liver stays to the right, the spleen to the left. The heart tilts leftward.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“Inside, you’re nearly wholly asymmetric,” says Angus Davison, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Nottingham, UK. And that, he adds, makes sense, because the body is trying to pack all the organs into a small space.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, our very molecules are often asymmetric: The complex arrangements of atoms that make up our cells usually come in mirror-image forms. As life developed on Earth, nature selected either the left- or right-handed version of each molecule to use: lefties for the building blocks of proteins, righties for the building blocks of DNA. This preference, Davison suggests, may kick off asymmetry in the early embryo. In particular, the meshwork of molecular struts that act as a cell’s internal skeleton seem to have a role in defining right and left, according to his recent work with snails.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut researchers know more about what happens at the whole-embryo level. Early in development — about Day 18 to 20 of a human pregnancy — a temporary structure called the left-right organizer forms in the embryo’s future belly. Inside it, cellular tentacles called cilia push fluid toward the left, and this sets off a chain of events that gives the embryo different left and right sides.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIf something goes wrong with the process, it may or may not cause problems down the line. In about one in 10,000 people, all the internal organs are reversed: heart on the right, liver on the left, etc. Their bodies work just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut in others, about one in 1,000 people, the reversal is only partial, leading to mix-ups, such as having no spleen at all. One of the biggest concerns for people born with this partial change to standard left-right organization — called heterotaxia — is heart defects, says Martina Brueckner, a pediatric cardiologist at the Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. The organ might have two right atria or two left atria instead of one of each, for example. These kinds of problems threaten survival and usually require corrective surgery.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-full\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"Drawing of four torsos showing the position of lungs, heart, liver, stomach and spleen in normal bodies and ones with left-right abnormalities.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/408/G-confusing-left-right_0.svg\\\" title=\\\"Left-right body abnormalities\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes an embryo gets its left-right signals crossed, and internal organs develop improperly. In the complete reversal known as situs inversus, organs like the stomach, heart, spleen and liver end up in mirror-image positions compared to the normal layout (known as situs solitus). And sometimes, the embryo ends up with two “right” or two “left” sides, a condition known as atrial isomerism, which can affect the structure of the heart, position of the liver, the number of spleens and the number of lobes in each lung, as well as other abnormalities. Whereas people can live perfectly healthily in cases of a complete reversal, the heart defects of atrial isomerism, particularly right atrial isomerism, can be severe.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\\n\u003c/figure\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eTo the left, to the left\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the earliest clues to how left-right decisions are made came from men with a condition called Kartagener’s syndrome. The condition can cause organs to be wholly reversed, as well as chronic sinusitis and lung-wall inflammations.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, men with Kartagener’s syndrome often are infertile. In the 1970s, Swedish scientist Björn Afzelius and colleagues linked that infertility to \u003ca href=\\\"http://jcb.rupress.org/content/66/2/225.long\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eproblems with the tail-like flagella that sperm use to swim\u003c/a\u003e. This led him to suggest that similar problems with cilia, which are related structures, could underlie the organ reversal, too. It would also explain the sinus and lung problems, because those body parts use cilia to sweep away dirt and mucus clogging the airways.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a leap of intuition, says David Smith, a specialist in biological fluid mechanics at the University of Birmingham in the UK, who coauthored \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-fluid-010518-040231\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ea 2019 article about asymmetry in the \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Fluid Mechanics\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/a\u003e And a leap in the right direction: Kartagener’s syndrome is now known as a subtype of primary ciliary dyskinesia (Greek for impaired movement). But at the time, recalls Brueckner, most scientists didn’t believe Afzelius. They didn’t think embryos even had moving cilia. It would take a couple of decades to prove his model right.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, scientists had begun to zero in on early events in the embryo as it sets up left and right. In a 1995 paper, geneticist Cliff Tabin and colleagues at Harvard Medical School in Boston described how \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867495904778\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ecertain proteins segregate to one or the other side of chick embryos\u003c/a\u003e. One of these is an important development regulator known as Sonic Hedgehog (yes, after the Sega video game). At first, the regulator is spread all over that left-right organizer structure, but later it’s found only on the left. As it turns out, Sonic Hedgehog and some other proteins that end up asymmetrically localized activate other ones. Together, these proteins create anatomical asymmetry.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eGoing with the flow\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut Tabin’s work didn’t explain how the initial regulators, like Sonic Hedgehog, got to the left side of the embryo. At that time, the cilia hypothesis was just one potential explanation. The breakthrough came in 1998 from Nobutaka Hirokawa, Shigenori Nonaka and colleagues at the University of Tokyo. The scientists examined mouse embryos with defective cilia. Although the embryos didn’t survive without these key structures anywhere in their bodies, the team could see that some of them were starting to arrange the heart in the wrong orientation. The researchers also captured live video, in normal mouse embryos, of cilia in the asymmetry organizer \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400817055\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003esweeping fluid toward the left\u003c/a\u003e. “This was really the giant step forward,” Brueckner says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe leftward sweep occurs because these special cilia in the left-right organizer spin asymmetrically. “Like a pinwheel,” Brueckner says, “they always move in one direction.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-left\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"This photograph of the mouse left-right organizer looks like a rough circle outlined in blue.

Brueckner’s team reported a clue in 2003. They found that cells on the left edge of the asymmetry organizer respond to the fluid by \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867403005117\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eallowing calcium to rush into their interiors\u003c/a\u003e. An influx of calcium like this can set off all kinds of cellular processes, including protein production.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eEvery answer raises yet another question: in this case, what, precisely, these left-side cells sense in the current of fluid washing over them.

But beauty, we know, is only skin-deep. Inside the human body, asymmetries abound. The liver stays to the right, the spleen to the left. The heart tilts leftward.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“Inside, you’re nearly wholly asymmetric,” says Angus Davison, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Nottingham, UK. And that, he adds, makes sense, because the body is trying to pack all the organs into a small space.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, our very molecules are often asymmetric: The complex arrangements of atoms that make up our cells usually come in mirror-image forms. As life developed on Earth, nature selected either the left- or right-handed version of each molecule to use: lefties for the building blocks of proteins, righties for the building blocks of DNA. This preference, Davison suggests, may kick off asymmetry in the early embryo. In particular, the meshwork of molecular struts that act as a cell’s internal skeleton seem to have a role in defining right and left, according to his recent work with snails.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut researchers know more about what happens at the whole-embryo level. Early in development — about Day 18 to 20 of a human pregnancy — a temporary structure called the left-right organizer forms in the embryo’s future belly. Inside it, cellular tentacles called cilia push fluid toward the left, and this sets off a chain of events that gives the embryo different left and right sides.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIf something goes wrong with the process, it may or may not cause problems down the line. In about one in 10,000 people, all the internal organs are reversed: heart on the right, liver on the left, etc. Their bodies work just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut in others, about one in 1,000 people, the reversal is only partial, leading to mix-ups, such as having no spleen at all. One of the biggest concerns for people born with this partial change to standard left-right organization — called heterotaxia — is heart defects, says Martina Brueckner, a pediatric cardiologist at the Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. The organ might have two right atria or two left atria instead of one of each, for example. These kinds of problems threaten survival and usually require corrective surgery.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eTo the left, to the left\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the earliest clues to how left-right decisions are made came from men with a condition called Kartagener’s syndrome. The condition can cause organs to be wholly reversed, as well as chronic sinusitis and lung-wall inflammations.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, men with Kartagener’s syndrome often are infertile. In the 1970s, Swedish scientist Björn Afzelius and colleagues linked that infertility to \u003ca href=\\\"http://jcb.rupress.org/content/66/2/225.long\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eproblems with the tail-like flagella that sperm use to swim\u003c/a\u003e. This led him to suggest that similar problems with cilia, which are related structures, could underlie the organ reversal, too. It would also explain the sinus and lung problems, because those body parts use cilia to sweep away dirt and mucus clogging the airways.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a leap of intuition, says David Smith, a specialist in biological fluid mechanics at the University of Birmingham in the UK, who coauthored \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-fluid-010518-040231\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ea 2019 article about asymmetry in the \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Fluid Mechanics\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/a\u003e And a leap in the right direction: Kartagener’s syndrome is now known as a subtype of primary ciliary dyskinesia (Greek for impaired movement). But at the time, recalls Brueckner, most scientists didn’t believe Afzelius. They didn’t think embryos even had moving cilia. It would take a couple of decades to prove his model right.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, scientists had begun to zero in on early events in the embryo as it sets up left and right. In a 1995 paper, geneticist Cliff Tabin and colleagues at Harvard Medical School in Boston described how \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867495904778\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ecertain proteins segregate to one or the other side of chick embryos\u003c/a\u003e. One of these is an important development regulator known as Sonic Hedgehog (yes, after the Sega video game). At first, the regulator is spread all over that left-right organizer structure, but later it’s found only on the left. As it turns out, Sonic Hedgehog and some other proteins that end up asymmetrically localized activate other ones. Together, these proteins create anatomical asymmetry.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eGoing with the flow\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut Tabin’s work didn’t explain how the initial regulators, like Sonic Hedgehog, got to the left side of the embryo. At that time, the cilia hypothesis was just one potential explanation. The breakthrough came in 1998 from Nobutaka Hirokawa, Shigenori Nonaka and colleagues at the University of Tokyo. The scientists examined mouse embryos with defective cilia. Although the embryos didn’t survive without these key structures anywhere in their bodies, the team could see that some of them were starting to arrange the heart in the wrong orientation. The researchers also captured live video, in normal mouse embryos, of cilia in the asymmetry organizer \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400817055\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003esweeping fluid toward the left\u003c/a\u003e. “This was really the giant step forward,” Brueckner says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe leftward sweep occurs because these special cilia in the left-right organizer spin asymmetrically. “Like a pinwheel,” Brueckner says, “they always move in one direction.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut how does that leftward current lead to the changes in protein location observed by Tabin? Brueckner’s team reported a clue in 2003. They found that cells on the left edge of the asymmetry organizer respond to the fluid by \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867403005117\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eallowing calcium to rush into their interiors\u003c/a\u003e. An influx of calcium like this can set off all kinds of cellular processes, including protein production.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eEvery answer raises yet another question: in this case, what, precisely, these left-side cells sense in the current of fluid washing over them. Hirokawa and colleagues suggest that swept along in the leftward current are \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/living-world/2019/bodys-tiny-cargo-carriers\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003elittle membranous packages\u003c/a\u003e — like messages in a bottle bobbing along in ocean currents — containing substances\u0026nbsp; \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03494\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003elike Sonic Hedgehog to promote left-ness\u003c/a\u003e. The alternative, suggested by Tabin and others, is that the receiving cells \u003ca href=\\\"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/17/1/1.short\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003esense the mechanical force of the leftward current\u003c/a\u003e, like seagrass pushed by ocean waves.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s possible both ideas are right, Smith says. “Maybe what’s going on is some sort of combination of force and biochemistry.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eWith a twist\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWhile humans keep their asymmetric nature shrouded in skin, garden snails wear theirs for all to see, in the turn of their shells. Some species have shells that tend to turn clockwise, and the rare misfits that spin counterclockwise may be unhealthy and less likely to hatch. In some other species, turning counterclockwise is common and seemingly harmless. But it does affect the snail’s love life, because the genitals of counterclockwise snails are on the wrong side to mate with the clockwise critters in the rest of the dating pool.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWorking with pond snails, \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982216000567\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eDavison’s lab\u003c/a\u003e and a \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep34809\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eJapanese group\u003c/a\u003e recently identified a gene that controls whether a snail mother’s offspring will be clockwise or counterclockwise. The gene carries instructions for a protein called formin, known to help assemble some of the cell’s interior struts. It turns out that snails with a disabled formin gene create babies with counterclockwise shells.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? Actin, the molecule that makes up those struts, naturally has a twist, explains Davison, but it relaxes a bit if formin is not working. \u0026nbsp;A subtle change to actin’s twist in the mother’s egg might, he suggests, cause the early snail embryo to switch its asymmetry pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s one way that nature’s asymmetric molecules could lead to asymmetry in whole animals.

Repeated attempts to find others had failed and by the end of 2017, Romeo gave up calling for females that never came.

The results, published in 2004, were shocking. Populations everywhere were plummeting; some species had vanished. The following year, international experts held a summit to thrash out an action plan, and one key recommendation was that zoos, aquariums and other organizations with suitable facilities should “rescue” the species closest to extinction and breed them in captivity.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIf all went well, those “assurance colonies” would maintain themselves and preserve what remained of their species’ genetic diversity. Where suitable habitat remained, surplus offspring could be returned to the wild to replenish dwindling populations or restore species to old haunts.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the plan. Conservationists scooped up rare frogs and toads, and the number of captive colonies proliferated. And some breeding programs have been a triumph. The Mallorcan midwife toad, for example, is now off the critical list, with 18 breeding populations reestablished in the wild. Tanzania’s Kihansi spray toad was declared extinct in the wild in 2009 after a hydro project destroyed its misty microhabitat alongside the waterfalls of the Kihansi Gorge. Painstaking efforts to replicate that misty atmosphere in breeding colonies paid off, and thousands of captive-bred tadpoles — along with an artificial misting system — have been returned to the gorge.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut for many rescued species, it was a different story. Some never developed eggs or sperm, or they produced them out of synch; some flunked the necessary mating behavior; a few produced embryos that rarely made it to tadpoles or toadlets. To add to the extinction crisis there was now a captive breeding crisis, I was told by conservation biologist Andy Kouba of Mississippi State University, who has worked with some of the US’s rarest amphibians.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-full\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"A global map is overlaid by a series of bar graphs classifying the severity of the effects of chytridiomycosis on amphibian species in different parts of the world.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/353/G-amphibian-decline-map.svg\\\" title=\\\"Chytridiomycosis\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDisappearing habitat, changing climate, pollution and overexploitation are all contributing to the global amphibian extinction crisis.

In large part, it comes down to how little is known about the finicky requirements of rare species. Frogs and toads are an extraordinarily diverse group of animals with many, often highly specialized reproductive strategies and mechanisms. Some breed in water, from placid lakes to fast-running streams and shallow temporary pools; others breed on land, from the rainforest floor to the canopy, beneath the moss of an alpine bog or balanced on reeds in a foamy nest of bubbles; most fertilize eggs externally though a few bear live young; some are monogamous, others promiscuous with multiple males piling in on spawning females.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s more, the changes in physiology and behavior that culminate in mating are prompted by a mix of environmental and social cues: changes in humidity, temperature or pressure; brighter, longer days; the calls of other frogs; a spell of hibernation or a sudden downpour that signals the start of the rainy season. Once a species is near extinction, there’s little chance of studying it in the wild to identify the triggers. “Sometimes we can figure it out and it works, but for other species, no matter what we try we still can’t get it right,” Kouba says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003caside class=\\\"article-sidebar -left\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-sidebar-img\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"Photograph of a dusky gopher frog\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/353/P-dusky-gopher-frog.jpg\\\" title=\\\"Dusky gopher frog\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-sidebar-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"source\\\"\u003eCREDIT: USDA / WIKIMEDIA COMMONS\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eSnapshot: Reversal of fortune\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the world’s most endangered animals, the dusky gopher frog (\u003cem\u003eLithobates sevosa\u003c/em\u003e) is becoming the poster frog for ART, demonstrating its potential to bring a species back from the very edge of extinction.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThese big-eyed, spotted frogs with their snore-like mating call were once down to around 100 wild individuals in Mississippi, with a similar number in captivity. The species is particularly picky about where it breeds, choosing fish-free ephemeral pools among longleaf pines. It has never bred naturally in captivity.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2006, Andy Kouba, with colleagues at the Memphis Zoo began developing hormone treatment and IVF for the frogs, eventually producing the first ever captive-bred dusky gophers. Since then, the team has honed a procedure for cryopreserving dusky gopher sperm, successfully used thawed sperm to fertilize fresh eggs and shown that male frogs produced that way grow up fit, healthy and able to reproduce.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s where the three arms of assisted reproductive technology (ART) come in: hormone treatments to persuade reluctant pairs to mate or to induce development and release of eggs and sperm; in vitro fertilization to increase the number and diversity of offspring; and cryopreservation of gametes so breeders can draw on them when they’re needed.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eA handful of endangered species have already benefited from one or more of this trio of technologies. In Australia, for instance, \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/RD/RD18011\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ehormone treatment has transformed unwilling pairs of northern corroboree frogs into ardent lovers\u003c/a\u003e, ensuring that they all contribute their genes to the next generation. The Wyoming toad from the Laramie Plains is officially extinct in the wild but has begun to make a comeback thanks to hormones and IVF. And the endangered boreal toad from the southern Rockies has gained some extra toadlets thanks to frozen sperm.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut it’s been hard going. Though science labs have used hormones and IVF for almost 70 years to supply amphibian eggs and embryos for basic research, when conservation biologists turned to the technology in the 1990s in an attempt to boost output, they found they couldn’t just adopt procedures worked out for a narrow set of lab models. It took years of tweaking and testing hormones at different doses to establish the first effective therapies; even the simpler task of mixing gametes in a dish needed work.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWith the number of rescue colonies rapidly proliferating — and many failing to breed naturally — there was a mounting sense of urgency. “We realized we had to ramp up this research,” Silla told me. And that’s now paying off. “The past few years have seen things progressing faster.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMost efforts to develop hormone treatments to stimulate gonad maturation and release of eggs and sperm have focused on injection of two hormones: gonadotropin-releasing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin (whose ability to trigger spawning in toads was the basis of human pregnancy tests until the 1970s). Some species respond best to one hormone, some to the other, and the dose and regimen of shots is critical. “Every species is different and it can take several years to get the right suite of hormones and figure out the timing and frequency of treatment,” Kouba says. For a long time, finding the right treatment for a new species was mostly a matter of trial and error. Today, recipes laying out the what, how and when are in place for some two dozen species.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as the number grows, patterns are emerging that should help speed the process. For example, it’s starting to look as if an amphibian’s ancestral line might dictate choice of hormone, with members of some frog and toad families responding best to one hormone, and those of other groups to the second.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-full\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"A graphic shows two hormone treatments used in breeding programs for endangered frogs and toads.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/353/G-hormone-therapy-in-frogs.svg\\\" title=\\\"Hormone treatment\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWith the right dose of the right hormone, frog and toad breeders can bypass nature’s cues and trigger production of eggs and sperm. Most efforts to artificially induce spawning rely on one of two hormones. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH-a), normally produced by the hypothalamus, prompts the pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulate the production of steroid hormones. In males, that leads to the release of testosterone, causing spermatogenesis, maturation and release of sperm. In females, it leads to ovulation, transport of eggs through the oviduct, production and secretion of egg jelly and spawning. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) acts directly on the gonads by mimicking luteinizing hormone.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eEvolutionary considerations might also prove key to predicting the best time for sperm collection, suggest Silla and Byrne. That’s because the quantity of sperm males make, and the speed at which they release it, ties in to a species’ mating strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn promiscuous species, competition between males for females drives the evolution of larger testes that make more sperm and release them faster. Take Western Australia’s quacking frog (yes, it quacks like a duck): It exhibits simultaneous polyandry, where many males cluster round a spawning female. Those males have huge testes packed with tens of thousands of sperm. Inject hormones and they start to release sperm within minutes, although the best time to collect is when sperm output peaks seven hours after treatment, Silla found.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eContrast that with the \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/profile.aspx?id=10693\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003esouthern corroboree frog\u003c/a\u003e, a critically endangered species from the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales. This frog is monogamous which, according to theory, means it needn’t produce many sperm or be in such a rush about it. Its testes are tiny. By Silla and Byrne’s theory, after hormone injection they’d have a long wait for few sperm. And that’s what they saw. “It was 36 hours to peak sperm release, and we only collected a few hundred,” Silla says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eTricks of the fertility toolbox\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eHormone treatment and getting gametes is just the start. Tool number two is IVF, which provides a way to optimize genetic diversity in tiny colonies by giving breeders control over the parentage of offspring. Simple in theory, less so in practice. The traditional technique honed on aquatic frogs and toads is to put eggs and sperm from minced testes into a petri dish, leave for a few minutes then flood with water: The sudden dilution shocks the sperm into activity.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut in conservation, there’s no question of sacrificing animals for their testes. Instead, breeders must collect sperm after it’s traveled to the cloaca and mixes with urine. Some toads respond to mere handling by dumping the sperm-urine cocktail – just pick them up and hold them over a dish, and if that doesn’t work, a little gentle pressure on the abdomen should do the trick. Frogs are less obliging and may require the use of fine catheters.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-right\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"Photograph of a string of toad eggs floating in water.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/353/P-string-of-toad-eggs.jpg\\\" title=\\\"Toad eggs\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFemale Puerto Rican crested toads (\u003cem\u003ePeltophryne lemur\u003c/em\u003e) can produce 15,000 eggs a year, but this critically endangered species rarely breeds without hormone treatment.

Success depends on mixing the right proportion of sperm and eggs — in fluid with just the right properties to activate sperm, and as with so much else, every species seems to need something different.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe third tool, cryopreservation, is about boosting output and ensuring the genetic health of threatened species. Hormone-treated amphibians frequently produce sperm and eggs out of synch, so the solution is to store one sex’s gametes until the other’s are available.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLong-term storage of sperm also opens up new possibilities for optimizing genetic diversity. A single clutch of eggs can be fertilized with sperm from many males; zoos and aquariums can exchange sperm; it should even be possible to crossbreed wild and captive animals. And particularly valuable individuals, such as those with resistance to disease, can keep contributing their genes long after they die.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough — you guessed — it’s all a lot trickier than it sounds.

Both treatments produced spectacular results, improving the number of breeding pairs up from between 20 to 30 percent to between 80 and 100 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eEggs are another matter: Their large size, yolk, high water content and thick coat of jelly have so far defeated attempts to freeze them. Solving that problem is a must, Kouba told me. “Freezing sperm will make a big difference but we’ll only be preserving male genomes — and that’s only half the picture.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, the number of endangered species benefiting from ART is small even as the need is huge. In some programs, many or all of the resulting offspring remain in captivity, helping to sustain the assurance colonies. But others have provided a multitude of tadpoles and toadlets for reintroduction to the wild: More than 300,000 Puerto Rican crested toadlets \u003ca href=\\\"http://crestedtoadssp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ehave been released on their native island\u003c/a\u003e, for instance, and hundreds of northern corroborees are settling back into their subalpine bogs.

A recent \u003ca href=\\\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6434/1459\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e assessment of this catastrophic fungal disease\u003c/a\u003e concludes that it has led to the decline of at least 500 amphibian species and the extinction of at least 90.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eHerpetologists began sounding the alarm in the late 1980s, and their fears prompted the first global assessment of frogs and toads and their kin. The results, published in 2004, were shocking. Populations everywhere were plummeting; some species had vanished. The following year, international experts held a summit to thrash out an action plan, and one key recommendation was that zoos, aquariums and other organizations with suitable facilities should “rescue” the species closest to extinction and breed them in captivity.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIf all went well, those “assurance colonies” would maintain themselves and preserve what remained of their species’ genetic diversity. Where suitable habitat remained, surplus offspring could be returned to the wild to replenish dwindling populations or restore species to old haunts.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the plan. Conservationists scooped up rare frogs and toads, and the number of captive colonies proliferated. And some breeding programs have been a triumph. The Mallorcan midwife toad, for example, is now off the critical list, with 18 breeding populations reestablished in the wild. Tanzania’s Kihansi spray toad was declared extinct in the wild in 2009 after a hydro project destroyed its misty microhabitat alongside the waterfalls of the Kihansi Gorge. Painstaking efforts to replicate that misty atmosphere in breeding colonies paid off, and thousands of captive-bred tadpoles — along with an artificial misting system — have been returned to the gorge.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut for many rescued species, it was a different story. Some never developed eggs or sperm, or they produced them out of synch; some flunked the necessary mating behavior; a few produced embryos that rarely made it to tadpoles or toadlets. To add to the extinction crisis there was now a captive breeding crisis, I was told by conservation biologist Andy Kouba of Mississippi State University, who has worked with some of the US’s rarest amphibians.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was it so hard to produce tadpoles? In large part, it comes down to how little is known about the finicky requirements of rare species. Frogs and toads are an extraordinarily diverse group of animals with many, often highly specialized reproductive strategies and mechanisms. Some breed in water, from placid lakes to fast-running streams and shallow temporary pools; others breed on land, from the rainforest floor to the canopy, beneath the moss of an alpine bog or balanced on reeds in a foamy nest of bubbles; most fertilize eggs externally though a few bear live young; some are monogamous, others promiscuous with multiple males piling in on spawning females.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s more, the changes in physiology and behavior that culminate in mating are prompted by a mix of environmental and social cues: changes in humidity, temperature or pressure; brighter, longer days; the calls of other frogs; a spell of hibernation or a sudden downpour that signals the start of the rainy season. Once a species is near extinction, there’s little chance of studying it in the wild to identify the triggers. “Sometimes we can figure it out and it works, but for other species, no matter what we try we still can’t get it right,” Kouba says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003caside class=\\\"article-sidebar -left\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-sidebar-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"source\\\"\u003eCREDIT: USDA / WIKIMEDIA COMMONS\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eSnapshot: Reversal of fortune\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the world’s most endangered animals, the dusky gopher frog (\u003cem\u003eLithobates sevosa\u003c/em\u003e) is becoming the poster frog for ART, demonstrating its potential to bring a species back from the very edge of extinction.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThese big-eyed, spotted frogs with their snore-like mating call were once down to around 100 wild individuals in Mississippi, with a similar number in captivity. The species is particularly picky about where it breeds, choosing fish-free ephemeral pools among longleaf pines. It has never bred naturally in captivity.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2006, Andy Kouba, with colleagues at the Memphis Zoo began developing hormone treatment and IVF for the frogs, eventually producing the first ever captive-bred dusky gophers. Since then, the team has honed a procedure for cryopreserving dusky gopher sperm, successfully used thawed sperm to fertilize fresh eggs and shown that male frogs produced that way grow up fit, healthy and able to reproduce.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s where the three arms of assisted reproductive technology (ART) come in: hormone treatments to persuade reluctant pairs to mate or to induce development and release of eggs and sperm; in vitro fertilization to increase the number and diversity of offspring; and cryopreservation of gametes so breeders can draw on them when they’re needed.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eA handful of endangered species have already benefited from one or more of this trio of technologies. In Australia, for instance, \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/RD/RD18011\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ehormone treatment has transformed unwilling pairs of northern corroboree frogs into ardent lovers\u003c/a\u003e, ensuring that they all contribute their genes to the next generation. The Wyoming toad from the Laramie Plains is officially extinct in the wild but has begun to make a comeback thanks to hormones and IVF. And the endangered boreal toad from the southern Rockies has gained some extra toadlets thanks to frozen sperm.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut it’s been hard going. Though science labs have used hormones and IVF for almost 70 years to supply amphibian eggs and embryos for basic research, when conservation biologists turned to the technology in the 1990s in an attempt to boost output, they found they couldn’t just adopt procedures worked out for a narrow set of lab models. It took years of tweaking and testing hormones at different doses to establish the first effective therapies; even the simpler task of mixing gametes in a dish needed work.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWith the number of rescue colonies rapidly proliferating — and many failing to breed naturally — there was a mounting sense of urgency. “We realized we had to ramp up this research,” Silla told me. And that’s now paying off. “The past few years have seen things progressing faster.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMost efforts to develop hormone treatments to stimulate gonad maturation and release of eggs and sperm have focused on injection of two hormones: gonadotropin-releasing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin (whose ability to trigger spawning in toads was the basis of human pregnancy tests until the 1970s). Some species respond best to one hormone, some to the other, and the dose and regimen of shots is critical. “Every species is different and it can take several years to get the right suite of hormones and figure out the timing and frequency of treatment,” Kouba says. For a long time, finding the right treatment for a new species was mostly a matter of trial and error. Today, recipes laying out the what, how and when are in place for some two dozen species.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as the number grows, patterns are emerging that should help speed the process. For example, it’s starting to look as if an amphibian’s ancestral line might dictate choice of hormone, with members of some frog and toad families responding best to one hormone, and those of other groups to the second.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eEvolutionary considerations might also prove key to predicting the best time for sperm collection, suggest Silla and Byrne. That’s because the quantity of sperm males make, and the speed at which they release it, ties in to a species’ mating strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn promiscuous species, competition between males for females drives the evolution of larger testes that make more sperm and release them faster. Take Western Australia’s quacking frog (yes, it quacks like a duck): It exhibits simultaneous polyandry, where many males cluster round a spawning female. Those males have huge testes packed with tens of thousands of sperm. Inject hormones and they start to release sperm within minutes, although the best time to collect is when sperm output peaks seven hours after treatment, Silla found.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eContrast that with the \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/profile.aspx?id=10693\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003esouthern corroboree frog\u003c/a\u003e, a critically endangered species from the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales. This frog is monogamous which, according to theory, means it needn’t produce many sperm or be in such a rush about it. Its testes are tiny. By Silla and Byrne’s theory, after hormone injection they’d have a long wait for few sperm. And that’s what they saw. “It was 36 hours to peak sperm release, and we only collected a few hundred,” Silla says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eTricks of the fertility toolbox\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eHormone treatment and getting gametes is just the start. Tool number two is IVF, which provides a way to optimize genetic diversity in tiny colonies by giving breeders control over the parentage of offspring. Simple in theory, less so in practice. The traditional technique honed on aquatic frogs and toads is to put eggs and sperm from minced testes into a petri dish, leave for a few minutes then flood with water: The sudden dilution shocks the sperm into activity.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBut in conservation, there’s no question of sacrificing animals for their testes. Instead, breeders must collect sperm after it’s traveled to the cloaca and mixes with urine. Some toads respond to mere handling by dumping the sperm-urine cocktail – just pick them up and hold them over a dish, and if that doesn’t work, a little gentle pressure on the abdomen should do the trick. Frogs are less obliging and may require the use of fine catheters.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s the easy bit. Success depends on mixing the right proportion of sperm and eggs — in fluid with just the right properties to activate sperm, and as with so much else, every species seems to need something different.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe third tool, cryopreservation, is about boosting output and ensuring the genetic health of threatened species. Hormone-treated amphibians frequently produce sperm and eggs out of synch, so the solution is to store one sex’s gametes until the other’s are available.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eLong-term storage of sperm also opens up new possibilities for optimizing genetic diversity. A single clutch of eggs can be fertilized with sperm from many males; zoos and aquariums can exchange sperm; it should even be possible to crossbreed wild and captive animals. And particularly valuable individuals, such as those with resistance to disease, can keep contributing their genes long after they die.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough — you guessed — it’s all a lot trickier than it sounds. Storing sperm is proving the easier option: Trials with assorted cryoprotective agents, storage media and rates of freezing and thawing have seen success for a growing number of species. “We’ve gone from 5 percent recovery after thawing to between 50 and 70 percent,” says Kouba, who with colleagues is working to create a National Amphibian Genome Bank in the US. “We’ve also shown that we can preserve sperm from live animals and produce offspring with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003caside class=\\\"article-sidebar -right\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-sidebar-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"source\\\"\u003eCREDIT: AIMEE SILLA\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003eSnapshot : A little dab of love potion\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn Australia, Aimee Silla and Phillip Byrne recently achieved a world first by breeding amphibians with the aid of a love potion rubbed on the skin. This quick and easy method of delivering hormones could see ART applied to a much wider range of species, including tiny animals like Madagascan miniature frogs for which injection is considered too risky.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSilla and Byrne have spent several years working with herpetologist Michael McFadden at \u003ca href=\\\"https://taronga.org.au/animals/corroboree-frog\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eSydney’s Taronga Zoo, home to a colony of critically endangered northern corroboree frogs\u003c/a\u003e. McFadden has successfully produced froglets the natural way, but each breeding season some females failed to spawn, and fewer than a third of the males did all the mating, shrinking the gene pool.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe scientists developed a hormone treatment that would persuade females to accept any male the team chose to pair them with, not just those “stud males.” They also compared treatments applied to the skin and injections. Both treatments produced spectacular results, improving the number of breeding pairs up from between 20 to 30 percent to between 80 and 100 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eEggs are another matter: Their large size, yolk, high water content and thick coat of jelly have so far defeated attempts to freeze them. Solving that problem is a must, Kouba told me. “Freezing sperm will make a big difference but we’ll only be preserving male genomes — and that’s only half the picture.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, the number of endangered species benefiting from ART is small even as the need is huge. In some programs, many or all of the resulting offspring remain in captivity, helping to sustain the assurance colonies. But others have provided a multitude of tadpoles and toadlets for reintroduction to the wild: More than 300,000 Puerto Rican crested toadlets \u003ca href=\\\"http://crestedtoadssp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ehave been released on their native island\u003c/a\u003e, for instance, and hundreds of northern corroborees are settling back into their subalpine bogs. Silla tells me how proud she is that all the northern corroborees produced during her research have been released. “I’m excited that this isn’t just a lab-based study but conservation in action.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThere are more sophisticated reproductive technologies on the horizon, but little prospect of using them to generate amphibians any time soon. In the meantime, hundreds of amphibians are edging ever closer to extinction. “Right now,” Kouba tells me, “one of the biggest needs is to set up more breeding programs to save more species.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eWith luck, patience, and plenty of TLC, some will be able to help themselves; for others, there’s the prospect of a helping human hand. “In the overall scheme of things, we are making a small dent compared to the number of amphibians that are threatened,” says Kouba. “But for the frogs and toads we are actively working on, we are making a difference.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s music to my ears. From my desk I can hear a common frog calling. I feel lucky that three of the UK’s seven species of amphibians wander into my backyard, and even luckier when some decide to stay.

The cell forms as warm, moist air near the equator rises into the upper atmosphere and then, as it cools and dries, much of it sinks down toward Earth at about 30 degrees latitude in each hemisphere. Lower in the atmosphere, this air moves back toward the equator, completing the cell. Some of this downward-moving mass of air escapes the Hadley cell and moves away from the equator, and is deflected by Earth’s rotation, creating the westerlies. Because the westerlies form at the edge of each hemisphere’s Hadley cell that is closest to the pole, the bigger the size of the cell, the more the winds move toward the pole.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eData collected by weather balloons, satellites and other means going back to 1960 show that \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007JD008861\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eEarth’s tropical belt has widened\u003c/a\u003e in the past few decades by a few degrees of latitude, effectively expanding the size of the Hadley cells.

With less distance to cover as they circle a narrower part of the globe, the law of conservation of angular momentum dictates that the winds should increase in speed, much like an ice skater rotates faster when she draws in her arms.

Global atmospheric circulation systems called Hadley cells are created by warm air rising near the equator, traveling toward the poles and then cooling and sinking back toward Earth near 30 degrees latitude in each hemisphere. The Coriolis force created by Earth’s rotation deflects some of that downward-moving air toward the east, which forms the westerlies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n  \\n          \\n          \\n        \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs researchers were making sense of these changes to the westerlies, other scientists began using measurements of CO₂ levels in the atmosphere to determine whether the shifting, speedier westerlies are causing a drop in the amount of CO₂ being absorbed by the Southern Ocean. They had reason to suppose that this would happen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike any gas, carbon dioxide exerts a pressure that depends on the amount of the gas relative to other gases in a mixture. If this so-called partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO₂) of the atmosphere is greater than the pCO₂ of the ocean, then the ocean will absorb carbon from the atmosphere. Otherwise it will release it. And as the westerlies get stronger, the pCO₂ of the Southern Ocean could change, due to shifts in the pattern of ocean currents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe westerlies drive the Southern Ocean current that circles Antarctica. The predominantly west-to-east current is further acted upon by a force generated by Earth’s rotation, known as the Coriolis force, which deflects moving objects to their right in the Northern Hemisphere and to their left in the Southern Hemisphere. The current circling Antarctica is deflected to its left, or northward, pushing the surface waters away from the pole. This sets the stage for water from deep in the Southern Ocean to move to the surface. \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00197-0\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eUp to 80 percent of all the deep water that returns to the surface around the globe makes that return in the Southern Ocean\u003c/a\u003e. “It’s unique,” says climate scientist Joellen Russell of the University of Arizona in Tucson. “There's nothing like it in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis massive upwelling of the deeper, carbon-rich waters of the Southern Ocean increases the pCO₂ of the ocean surface, which decreases its capacity to act as a carbon sink, the argument goes.

This was a cause for concern, given that the Southern Ocean is “the most important marine carbon sink on the planet,” says ocean biogeochemist Peter Landschützer of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo Landschützer and his colleagues took a closer look at a global database of pCO₂ values, created from observations of surface waters by instruments deployed in the sea or carried on research and commercial ships.

Since data are sparser for the earlier decades than for recent years, Landschützer’s team filled in the gaps using other, less direct but more frequently measured parameters such as sea surface temperature and salinity and their well-understood relationship to pCO₂ of surface waters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey estimated that the Southern Ocean had indeed taken in less CO₂ than expected from 1982 to 2001. The trend reversed in 2002, with the ocean acting as a more vigorous carbon sink all the way up to 2011. \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43826-y\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eFrom 2011 to 2016, however, the Southern Ocean went back to being less effective in its carbon absorption\u003c/a\u003e. The team tried to find a link between the changes in the Southern Ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂ and the poleward-shifted westerlies. “We were quite surprised that we did not,” Landschützer says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis called for an explanation, and the answer turned out to be complicated. Further analysis showed that the changing westerlies are, indeed, increasing the upwelling of carbon-rich deep waters near Antarctica. This effect, though, is being offset further north in the Southern Ocean by an increased carbon uptake in regions where the westerlies are blowing less vigorously than in the past. This would imply that there should be no overall change in the absorption of carbon. But Landschützer’s team found that the Southern Ocean’s ability to absorb carbon is increasing or decreasing over timescales of roughly a decade. The researchers put these flips down to the local wind patterns in different parts of the Southern Ocean known as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian sectors. Winds there seem to change every decade, as evidenced by about 35 years of data, and those local alterations line up well with carbon absorption trends, Landschützer says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of the above analysis was based on data collected by ships plying the Southern Ocean mainly during summer. The data for the winter season was spotty; it is hard for ships to venture close to Antarctica at that time. So Landschützer’s team used the richer summer data and the sparse winter data to extrapolate and account for the winter months as best they could. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut in recent years, researchers have started using floats that are offering a new, broader glimpse of winter goings-on in the Southern Ocean.

One way to confirm that speedier westerlies have an impact on Southern Ocean outgassing, and thus on the levels of atmospheric CO₂, is to look at past climate evidence. Krystyna Saunders and her colleagues decided to look for some of that evidence on subantarctic Macquarie Island, which lies about 1,500 kilometers from Tasmania, midway between Australia and Antarctica. At latitude degrees 54S, it’s right in the main band of the westerlies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGetting to Macquarie Island is no small feat, even on the \u003cem\u003eAurora Australis,\u003c/em\u003e a 311-foot-long icebreaker.

That record lies at the bottom of Emerald Lake, a body of freshwater on the island’s western edge. It’s exposed to the westerlies and thus to salty ocean spray blown in by the winds: The greater the wind speeds, the higher the salinity of the lake. The salinity in turn affects which species of diatoms, types of algae, can thrive in the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen they die, diatoms sink to the bottom of the lake and are buried in sediments on the lakebed, creating a layered chronicle of the salinity of the lake — and by proxy the speed of the winds.

Changes in the extensive Atlantic Ocean circulation system that includes the Gulf Stream may also be exacerbating the warming of the Southern Ocean, which in turn could be adding to the poleward shift and intensification of the westerlies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis circulation system, called the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, or AMOC, brings warm, salty surface water to the north, where it cools and sinks and then heads back to the Southern Hemisphere through deeper ocean layers.

This fresh water reduces the salinity, and hence the density, of the surface waters. The formation of dense, salty, cold water is essential for it to sink down to the deep ocean in the North, from where it makes its return to the Southern Hemisphere. This process is being disrupted by climate change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince 2004, \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.rapid.ac.uk\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ea project called RAPID\u003c/a\u003e has deployed moorings across the breadth and depth of the Atlantic at latitude degrees 26N (stretching from Florida to Morocco), to directly measure changes in the velocity of the AMOC. The measurements show that the current is indeed slowing down. But because of inherent decade-to-decade variations in the climate system, 15 years’ worth of direct measurements isn’t enough to establish a trend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo Levke Caesar, then with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, and her colleagues extended this record back in time by using actual measurements of sea surface temperatures from 1870 to 2016, combined with a high-resolution climate model to \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0006-5\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ereconstruct the strength of the AMOC\u003c/a\u003e over the past 150 years or so. Their work shows that the circulation system’s strength declined to a minimum around 1990, then grew until the early 2000s, and then started declining again. Other scientists have found similar results. As long as greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, “all climate models predict a slowdown of the AMOC,” Caesar says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause the AMOC transports heat from the south to the north, a slowdown effectively cools the Northern Hemisphere and heats up the Southern Hemisphere. This warming also intensifies the westerlies and shifts them toward the South Pole, leading to a greater vertical churning of the Southern Ocean, which may contribute to global warming by weakening the ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂. Since the likely result is even more glacial meltwater flowing into the North Atlantic, this could further weaken the AMOC. It has all the makings of a system that’s slipping out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA similar runaway process is thought to have ended the last ice age, raising CO₂ levels from about 180 to 240 parts per million. This rise happened from about 17,500 years ago to 11,700 years ago, causing the deglaciation that made Earth more habitable. Atmospheric CO₂ levels are now past a whopping 410 ppm due to human activity, and rising. In a mere 250 years, we have increased CO₂ levels by more than the amount that melted an icy planet over thousands of years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe winds are howling again over the Southern Ocean and are dangerously close to awakening a beast that, until now, has been helping us by absorbing copious amounts of carbon.

And the Southern Ocean accounts for nearly 40 percent of this marine carbon absorption, even though it makes up only one-fifth of Earth’s ocean surface area.

If this link between wind and CO₂ holds true today, it will lead to higher levels of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, which will speed up climate change, which could further intensify the westerlies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s growing evidence that, at least in the winter months when the westerlies are at their most violent, some parts of the Southern Ocean are giving off more of the gas than was previously estimated.

The cell forms as warm, moist air near the equator rises into the upper atmosphere and then, as it cools and dries, much of it sinks down toward Earth at about 30 degrees latitude in each hemisphere. Lower in the atmosphere, this air moves back toward the equator, completing the cell. Some of this downward-moving mass of air escapes the Hadley cell and moves away from the equator, and is deflected by Earth’s rotation, creating the westerlies. Because the westerlies form at the edge of each hemisphere’s Hadley cell that is closest to the pole, the bigger the size of the cell, the more the winds move toward the pole.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eData collected by weather balloons, satellites and other means going back to 1960 show that \u003ca href=\\\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007JD008861\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eEarth’s tropical belt has widened\u003c/a\u003e in the past few decades by a few degrees of latitude, effectively expanding the size of the Hadley cells. This is partly due to global warming, as predicted by climate models. At the same time, the westerlies have been pushed poleward. With less distance to cover as they circle a narrower part of the globe, the law of conservation of angular momentum dictates that the winds should increase in speed, much like an ice skater rotates faster when she draws in her arms. And measurements during the past three decades show that the westerlies have, indeed, intensified.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs researchers were making sense of these changes to the westerlies, other scientists began using measurements of CO₂ levels in the atmosphere to determine whether the shifting, speedier westerlies are causing a drop in the amount of CO₂ being absorbed by the Southern Ocean. They had reason to suppose that this would happen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike any gas, carbon dioxide exerts a pressure that depends on the amount of the gas relative to other gases in a mixture. If this so-called partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO₂) of the atmosphere is greater than the pCO₂ of the ocean, then the ocean will absorb carbon from the atmosphere. Otherwise it will release it. And as the westerlies get stronger, the pCO₂ of the Southern Ocean could change, due to shifts in the pattern of ocean currents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe westerlies drive the Southern Ocean current that circles Antarctica. The predominantly west-to-east current is further acted upon by a force generated by Earth’s rotation, known as the Coriolis force, which deflects moving objects to their right in the Northern Hemisphere and to their left in the Southern Hemisphere. The current circling Antarctica is deflected to its left, or northward, pushing the surface waters away from the pole. This sets the stage for water from deep in the Southern Ocean to move to the surface. \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00197-0\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eUp to 80 percent of all the deep water that returns to the surface around the globe makes that return in the Southern Ocean\u003c/a\u003e. “It’s unique,” says climate scientist Joellen Russell of the University of Arizona in Tucson. “There's nothing like it in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis massive upwelling of the deeper, carbon-rich waters of the Southern Ocean increases the pCO₂ of the ocean surface, which decreases its capacity to act as a carbon sink, the argument goes.

This is due to the complicating effects of local wind patterns and the fact that researchers are only just beginning to make direct measurements of the outgassing of CO₂ during peak winter months there. So far, the data paint a somewhat confusing, and concerning, picture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrevious estimates had shown that between 1981 and 2004, the Southern Ocean \u003ca href=\\\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/316/5832/1735\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eabsorbed about 80 million fewer metric tons of carbon\u003c/a\u003e per year than expected. This was a cause for concern, given that the Southern Ocean is “the most important marine carbon sink on the planet,” says ocean biogeochemist Peter Landschützer of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo Landschützer and his colleagues took a closer look at a global database of pCO₂ values, created from observations of surface waters by instruments deployed in the sea or carried on research and commercial ships. Known as the \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.socat.info\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eSurface Ocean CO₂ Atlas\u003c/a\u003e (SOCAT) and established in 2007, it contains almost 26 million observations of global oceans and coastal seas from 1957 to 2019. Since data are sparser for the earlier decades than for recent years, Landschützer’s team filled in the gaps using other, less direct but more frequently measured parameters such as sea surface temperature and salinity and their well-understood relationship to pCO₂ of surface waters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey estimated that the Southern Ocean had indeed taken in less CO₂ than expected from 1982 to 2001. The trend reversed in 2002, with the ocean acting as a more vigorous carbon sink all the way up to 2011. \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43826-y\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eFrom 2011 to 2016, however, the Southern Ocean went back to being less effective in its carbon absorption\u003c/a\u003e. The team tried to find a link between the changes in the Southern Ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂ and the poleward-shifted westerlies. “We were quite surprised that we did not,” Landschützer says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis called for an explanation, and the answer turned out to be complicated. Further analysis showed that the changing westerlies are, indeed, increasing the upwelling of carbon-rich deep waters near Antarctica. This effect, though, is being offset further north in the Southern Ocean by an increased carbon uptake in regions where the westerlies are blowing less vigorously than in the past. This would imply that there should be no overall change in the absorption of carbon. But Landschützer’s team found that the Southern Ocean’s ability to absorb carbon is increasing or decreasing over timescales of roughly a decade. The researchers put these flips down to the local wind patterns in different parts of the Southern Ocean known as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian sectors. Winds there seem to change every decade, as evidenced by about 35 years of data, and those local alterations line up well with carbon absorption trends, Landschützer says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of the above analysis was based on data collected by ships plying the Southern Ocean mainly during summer. The data for the winter season was spotty; it is hard for ships to venture close to Antarctica at that time. So Landschützer’s team used the richer summer data and the sparse winter data to extrapolate and account for the winter months as best they could. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut in recent years, researchers have started using floats that are offering a new, broader glimpse of winter goings-on in the Southern Ocean.

The floats, which had continuously monitored the top 2,000 meters of the Southern Ocean waters from May 1, 2014, to May 1, 2017, have sensors for a range of ocean surface parameters, and these can be used to calculate the pCO₂ of the surface waters.  \u003ca href=\\\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL078013\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eThe analysis by Gray’s team showed that the Southern Ocean around Antarctica is outgassing significantly more CO₂ in the winter \u003c/a\u003e than Lanschützer’s methodology estimated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo see if they could resolve the discrepancy, Landschützer and colleagues combined the data sets and found that “the truth lies somewhere in the middle,” he says: The carbon uptake is not as low as the direct float measurements suggest, but neither is it as high as estimated by the ship-only data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile more work will help climate scientists understand exactly what’s happening in the Southern Ocean, for the University of Arizona’s Russell, the direct winter data from the SOCCOM floats is already raising alarms. “In the deep winter, when the winds are howling the strongest and the deepest layers are being stirred to the surface, that’s when we're tapping those older carbon waters,” she says. “And that's what's worrisome.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eA salty log\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-marine-010814-015924\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eThe deep waters are carbon-rich\u003c/a\u003e because of the microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton that live in the surface waters. The phytoplankton photosynthesize the CO₂ in the water into organic molecules to build their bodies. When they die, they sink to the ocean floor, sequestering the carbon for centuries. Some phytoplankton are consumed by larger organisms called zooplankton, which in turn are eaten by even bigger creatures whose carbon-rich fecal pellets and dead bodies can also end up on the ocean floor, burying ever more carbon in the deep waters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe evidence from the SOCCOM floats suggests that it’s these deep waters that are upwelling during the Antarctic winters. “It's the old rotted water that normally takes hundreds of years to circulate out of the deep,” Russell says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScientists surmise that intensifying westerlies are bringing more of this carbon-rich deep water to the surface — but they need more evidence. One way to confirm that speedier westerlies have an impact on Southern Ocean outgassing, and thus on the levels of atmospheric CO₂, is to look at past climate evidence. Krystyna Saunders and her colleagues decided to look for some of that evidence on subantarctic Macquarie Island, which lies about 1,500 kilometers from Tasmania, midway between Australia and Antarctica. At latitude degrees 54S, it’s right in the main band of the westerlies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGetting to Macquarie Island is no small feat, even on the \u003cem\u003eAurora Australis,\u003c/em\u003e a 311-foot-long icebreaker. Despite its size, the ship can be tossed around by massive swells, the kind Shackleton wrote about. “You can be lying down in your bunk, rolling from side to side and head to toe as the ship swirls around,” Saunders says. “If you get seasick like me, it’s quite horrible.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn Macquarie Island, Saunders and her colleagues capitalized on a fortuitous natural record that provides clues to how strongly the winds around the island have blown in the past. That record lies at the bottom of Emerald Lake, a body of freshwater on the island’s western edge. It’s exposed to the westerlies and thus to salty ocean spray blown in by the winds: The greater the wind speeds, the higher the salinity of the lake. The salinity in turn affects which species of diatoms, types of algae, can thrive in the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen they die, diatoms sink to the bottom of the lake and are buried in sediments on the lakebed, creating a layered chronicle of the salinity of the lake — and by proxy the speed of the winds. Saunders’ team extracted sediment cores from the lakebed, focusing on layers that had accumulated during the Holocene, the present epoch in Earth’s history that began about 11,700 years ago at the end of the last ice age.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving inferred the speeds of westerlies over the course of the Holocene, they then looked at data from ice cores drilled in Antarctica to get a direct measure of the amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere over that same time period. \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0186-5\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eThey found a clear correlation\u003c/a\u003e. “If you look at periods when the winds were above their average strengths, and periods when carbon dioxide was above its average concentration, they overlap,” Saunders says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis has implications for our understanding of the effect the westerlies have on the Southern Ocean’s capacity to absorb carbon. Saunders’ study supports the idea that as the westerlies speed up, the Southern Ocean will outgas more CO₂ — as shown by Gray’s report on wintertime data collected by the SOCCOM floats — and goes against the analysis of 35 years of ship-based data by Landschützer’s team. Only more studies, along the lines of Landschützer’s attempt to reconcile the various datasets, will help resolve this debate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAwakening a beast\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s one more factor that could feed into the vicious cycle that scientists fear may already be underway in the Southern Ocean. Changes in the extensive Atlantic Ocean circulation system that includes the Gulf Stream may also be exacerbating the warming of the Southern Ocean, which in turn could be adding to the poleward shift and intensification of the westerlies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis circulation system, called the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, or AMOC, brings warm, salty surface water to the north, where it cools and sinks and then heads back to the Southern Hemisphere through deeper ocean layers. Scientists have found evidence that \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0007-4\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ethe AMOC has been slowing down\u003c/a\u003e, particularly in the last 150 years compared to the preceding 1,500 years. One indication of this is that particles being deposited on the ocean floor have been getting smaller and smaller: Fast-flowing water can whisk away smaller particles, allowing only the larger particles to settle, whereas slower water allows smaller and smaller particles to drop to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of the AMOC’s slowdown can be attributed to one of the consequences of global warming: an increasing supply of glacial meltwater into the North Atlantic. This fresh water reduces the salinity, and hence the density, of the surface waters. The formation of dense, salty, cold water is essential for it to sink down to the deep ocean in the North, from where it makes its return to the Southern Hemisphere. This process is being disrupted by climate change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince 2004, \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.rapid.ac.uk\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ea project called RAPID\u003c/a\u003e has deployed moorings across the breadth and depth of the Atlantic at latitude degrees 26N (stretching from Florida to Morocco), to directly measure changes in the velocity of the AMOC. The measurements show that the current is indeed slowing down. But because of inherent decade-to-decade variations in the climate system, 15 years’ worth of direct measurements isn’t enough to establish a trend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo Levke Caesar, then with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, and her colleagues extended this record back in time by using actual measurements of sea surface temperatures from 1870 to 2016, combined with a high-resolution climate model to \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0006-5\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ereconstruct the strength of the AMOC\u003c/a\u003e over the past 150 years or so. Their work shows that the circulation system’s strength declined to a minimum around 1990, then grew until the early 2000s, and then started declining again. Other scientists have found similar results. As long as greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, “all climate models predict a slowdown of the AMOC,” Caesar says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause the AMOC transports heat from the south to the north, a slowdown effectively cools the Northern Hemisphere and heats up the Southern Hemisphere. This warming also intensifies the westerlies and shifts them toward the South Pole, leading to a greater vertical churning of the Southern Ocean, which may contribute to global warming by weakening the ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂. Since the likely result is even more glacial meltwater flowing into the North Atlantic, this could further weaken the AMOC. It has all the makings of a system that’s slipping out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA similar runaway process is thought to have ended the last ice age, raising CO₂ levels from about 180 to 240 parts per million. This rise happened from about 17,500 years ago to 11,700 years ago, causing the deglaciation that made Earth more habitable. Atmospheric CO₂ levels are now past a whopping 410 ppm due to human activity, and rising. In a mere 250 years, we have increased CO₂ levels by more than the amount that melted an icy planet over thousands of years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe winds are howling again over the Southern Ocean and are dangerously close to awakening a beast that, until now, has been helping us by absorbing copious amounts of carbon.

Helium is the second most common element in the universe, after hydrogen, and neon ranks fifth or sixth. And in interstellar space, where extreme temperatures and densities are the rule, noble gases do things they would never do on Earth. That includes forming molecules. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to providing insight into the universe’s infancy, these exotic molecules tell scientists about the current conditions in the space between the stars — the gases that make up the interstellar medium — which is of intense interest to astronomers. “The interstellar medium is the place where stars and planetary systems are born,” says Maryvonne Gerin, an astrophysicist at the Observatory of Paris and coauthor of a 2016 \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics \u003c/em\u003earticle on \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-astro-081915-023409\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003einterstellar molecules\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\\\"article-sidebar -right\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-sidebar-img\\\"\u003e\\n        \u003cimg alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/10.1146/knowable-121119-1/\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n      \u003cdiv class=\\\"article-sidebar-text\\\"\u003e\\n        \\n\\n        \\n          \u003ch2\u003eEarthly noble gas discoveries\u003c/h2\u003e\\n        \\n\\n         \\n\\n        \u003cp\u003eHere on Earth, scientists have been concocting noble gas molecules for nearly a century.

In 2009 the Herschel Space Observatory lifted off for space and literally kept its cool during the mission by carrying a tank of frigid liquid helium that lasted four years. This allowed Herschel to observe far-infrared wavelengths from distant objects without the interference its own warmth would have produced. Because many molecules absorb and emit far-infrared light, this spectral range is a good place to seek new space molecules. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithin a year of Herschel’s launch, astronomers began noticing that something in interstellar space was absorbing far-infrared light at a wavelength of 485 microns, a spectral line that hadn’t been observed before. “Nobody could figure out what it was,” says David Neufeld, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University and coauthor of the 2016 \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review\u003c/em\u003e article (and an acquaintance of the author of this story in graduate school). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSchilke consulted colleagues in his group at Cologne and elsewhere. “We sat in the office at the whiteboard,” he says, “and we put all the possible molecules on there, including argonium.” No known molecule matched the observed wavelength of 485 microns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Barlow’s team was using Herschel data to study the Crab Nebula, the remains of a massive star our ancestors saw explode in the year 1054.

After all, astronomers had been seeing that same 485-micron spectral line elsewhere. “When I first heard about the detection,” Schilke says, “I was extremely embarrassed that we had not spotted this ourselves.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe scientists were the victims of a down-to-earth mix-up. They thought they knew the wavelengths argonium produced, because scientists had created it in the lab decades earlier and measured its spectrum. But these laboratory molecules contained argon-40, which is by far the most common argon isotope — on Earth. But that’s only because the argon we breathe comes from the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe universe is different. “In the interstellar medium,” says Schilke, “argon-36 is by far the most abundant, and we were just too stupid to realize it.” Argonium made with argon-36 absorbs and emits light at slightly different wavelengths than it does with argon-40, explaining why the scientists had missed the identification.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, once they recognized the existence of interstellar argonium, Schilke, Neufeld, Gerin and their colleagues sought to explain its formation. “This is a molecule that doesn’t like molecules,” Schilke says, just as argon is an atom that doesn’t like atoms.

First, a cosmic ray — a high-speed charged particle — strips an electron from an interstellar argon atom, making Ar\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e. Then that argon ion can steal a hydrogen atom from a hydrogen molecule (H\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e) to create argonium, ArH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e, because the hydrogen atom is more attracted to the argon ion than to its hydrogen mate. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut argonium is fragile, and the same hydrogen molecules it requires for its formation can also destroy it. The noble gas molecule can therefore exist only where there’s just enough molecular hydrogen to create argonium but not so much as to tear it apart. This stringent requirement turns out to be handy for identifying which interstellar clouds aren’t likely to spawn new stars and planets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterstellar gas in our part of the Milky Way comes in two main types: atomic and molecular. The first and more common type consists primarily of individual hydrogen and helium atoms. Because atomic gas is diffuse, it rarely makes new stars. Instead, most stars arise in denser gas where atoms crowd together to create molecules. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt can be difficult to tell apart the interstellar clouds that consist mostly of atomic gas from those that consist mostly of molecular gas, and that’s where argonium comes in. “It’s a tracer of almost purely \u003cem\u003eatomic\u003c/em\u003e gas,” Schilke says. In fact, although argonium is a molecule, \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2014/06/aa23727-14/aa23727-14.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eit exists only in gas that’s 99.9 to 99.99 percent atomic\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause cosmic rays lead to the creation of argonium, its abundance in interstellar space has also helped nail down the number of cosmic rays darting through the galaxy. “There are more cosmic rays than we thought before,” Gerin says. That’s important not only for future Captain Kirks wishing to minimize their exposure to the destructive radiation as they travel between star systems, but also to scientists studying the chemistry of the interstellar medium, because cosmic rays are the first step in the creation of other molecules as well. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe universe’s first molecule\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven after the discovery of interstellar argonium, astronomers continued their quest for the simplest noble gas molecule, helium hydride, the one that theorists had predicted decades ago. “This is the first chemical bond that formed in the universe,” says astrophysicist Stephen Lepp of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe molecule arose because hydrogen and helium were the two chief elements to emerge from the big bang. At the beginning, the universe was so hot that any electrons either element managed to capture would immediately be stripped away by high-energy radiation generated by the extreme heat. But as space expanded, it cooled, and about 100,000 years after the big bang, each helium nucleus grabbed two electrons and became neutral.

Here, about 600 years ago, an aging star known as a red giant shed its atmosphere — something our own sun will do in about 7.8 billion years. This exposed the dying star’s hot core, which shines at a blistering 190,000 kelvins (340,000 degrees Fahrenheit) and emits extreme ultraviolet light that tears electrons from helium atoms, creating He\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e. Combine that with neutral hydrogen atoms from other parts of the nebula and you have HeH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e.

That’s because the outer shell of a noble gas atom already has its fill of electrons, so it won’t ordinarily exchange electrons to bond with other atoms and form molecules — at least, not here on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn retrospect, space seems the perfect place to seek noble gas molecules, because these gases abound in the cosmos. Helium is the second most common element in the universe, after hydrogen, and neon ranks fifth or sixth. And in interstellar space, where extreme temperatures and densities are the rule, noble gases do things they would never do on Earth. That includes forming molecules. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to providing insight into the universe’s infancy, these exotic molecules tell scientists about the current conditions in the space between the stars — the gases that make up the interstellar medium — which is of intense interest to astronomers. “The interstellar medium is the place where stars and planetary systems are born,” says Maryvonne Gerin, an astrophysicist at the Observatory of Paris and coauthor of a 2016 \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics \u003c/em\u003earticle on \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-astro-081915-023409\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003einterstellar molecules\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\\\"article-sidebar -right\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-sidebar-text\\\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEarthly noble gas discoveries\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere on Earth, scientists have been concocting noble gas molecules for nearly a century.

Though naturally occurring helium hydride has never been found on Earth, scientists were able to force the two atoms together in the lab almost a century ago. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo it seemed this combo would be the most likely quarry for astronomers as well. Instead, they were caught off guard by an even stranger molecule.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAn interstellar embarrassment\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eArgon is more than 20 times as common in Earth’s atmosphere as carbon dioxide but gets far less press. In fact, it is the third most abundant gas in the air you breathe. Nitrogen and oxygen make up 78 percent and 21 percent of Earth’s atmosphere, respectively, while argon accounts for most of the remaining 1 percent. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut nobody was looking for an interstellar molecule containing argon. “It was basically a serendipitous discovery,” says University College London astrophysicist Mike Barlow, who led the team that accidentally found ArH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e: argonium, which consists of argon and hydrogen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother noble gas element helped to make the find possible. In 2009 the Herschel Space Observatory lifted off for space and literally kept its cool during the mission by carrying a tank of frigid liquid helium that lasted four years. This allowed Herschel to observe far-infrared wavelengths from distant objects without the interference its own warmth would have produced. Because many molecules absorb and emit far-infrared light, this spectral range is a good place to seek new space molecules. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithin a year of Herschel’s launch, astronomers began noticing that something in interstellar space was absorbing far-infrared light at a wavelength of 485 microns, a spectral line that hadn’t been observed before. “Nobody could figure out what it was,” says David Neufeld, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University and coauthor of the 2016 \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review\u003c/em\u003e article (and an acquaintance of the author of this story in graduate school). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSchilke consulted colleagues in his group at Cologne and elsewhere. “We sat in the office at the whiteboard,” he says, “and we put all the possible molecules on there, including argonium.” No known molecule matched the observed wavelength of 485 microns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Barlow’s team was using Herschel data to study the Crab Nebula, the remains of a massive star our ancestors saw explode in the year 1054. The celestial fireworks forged argon and other “metals,” which astronomers define as all elements heavier than helium.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the nebula’s argon-rich gas, Barlow and his colleagues spotted \u003cem\u003etwo\u003c/em\u003e unidentified spectral lines. One was the same mysterious line everyone else had been seeing at 485 microns; the other had exactly half the wavelength — the hallmark of a molecule containing two atoms. Barlow identified it as argonium, publishing the discovery in 2013. It was \u003ca href=\\\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1343.abstract\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ethe first noble gas molecule ever found in nature\u003c/a\u003e. (Barlow notes that at the last minute the editors of his scientific paper changed “molecule” in the title to “molecular ion.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe discovery was a shock. “We were just stunned when we heard this,” Neufeld says. After all, astronomers had been seeing that same 485-micron spectral line elsewhere. “When I first heard about the detection,” Schilke says, “I was extremely embarrassed that we had not spotted this ourselves.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe scientists were the victims of a down-to-earth mix-up. They thought they knew the wavelengths argonium produced, because scientists had created it in the lab decades earlier and measured its spectrum. But these laboratory molecules contained argon-40, which is by far the most common argon isotope — on Earth. But that’s only because the argon we breathe comes from the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe universe is different. “In the interstellar medium,” says Schilke, “argon-36 is by far the most abundant, and we were just too stupid to realize it.” Argonium made with argon-36 absorbs and emits light at slightly different wavelengths than it does with argon-40, explaining why the scientists had missed the identification.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, once they recognized the existence of interstellar argonium, Schilke, Neufeld, Gerin and their colleagues sought to explain its formation. “This is a molecule that doesn’t like molecules,” Schilke says, just as argon is an atom that doesn’t like atoms. This peculiar characteristic is turning out to be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eArgonium’s cosmic origins\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBased on standard calculations of how chemical reactions proceed in space, scientists know the formation of the interstellar argonium molecule requires two steps. First, a cosmic ray — a high-speed charged particle — strips an electron from an interstellar argon atom, making Ar\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e. Then that argon ion can steal a hydrogen atom from a hydrogen molecule (H\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e) to create argonium, ArH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e, because the hydrogen atom is more attracted to the argon ion than to its hydrogen mate. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut argonium is fragile, and the same hydrogen molecules it requires for its formation can also destroy it. The noble gas molecule can therefore exist only where there’s just enough molecular hydrogen to create argonium but not so much as to tear it apart. This stringent requirement turns out to be handy for identifying which interstellar clouds aren’t likely to spawn new stars and planets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterstellar gas in our part of the Milky Way comes in two main types: atomic and molecular. The first and more common type consists primarily of individual hydrogen and helium atoms. Because atomic gas is diffuse, it rarely makes new stars. Instead, most stars arise in denser gas where atoms crowd together to create molecules. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt can be difficult to tell apart the interstellar clouds that consist mostly of atomic gas from those that consist mostly of molecular gas, and that’s where argonium comes in. “It’s a tracer of almost purely \u003cem\u003eatomic\u003c/em\u003e gas,” Schilke says. In fact, although argonium is a molecule, \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2014/06/aa23727-14/aa23727-14.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eit exists only in gas that’s 99.9 to 99.99 percent atomic\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause cosmic rays lead to the creation of argonium, its abundance in interstellar space has also helped nail down the number of cosmic rays darting through the galaxy. “There are more cosmic rays than we thought before,” Gerin says. That’s important not only for future Captain Kirks wishing to minimize their exposure to the destructive radiation as they travel between star systems, but also to scientists studying the chemistry of the interstellar medium, because cosmic rays are the first step in the creation of other molecules as well. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe universe’s first molecule\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven after the discovery of interstellar argonium, astronomers continued their quest for the simplest noble gas molecule, helium hydride, the one that theorists had predicted decades ago. “This is the first chemical bond that formed in the universe,” says astrophysicist Stephen Lepp of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe molecule arose because hydrogen and helium were the two chief elements to emerge from the big bang. At the beginning, the universe was so hot that any electrons either element managed to capture would immediately be stripped away by high-energy radiation generated by the extreme heat. But as space expanded, it cooled, and about 100,000 years after the big bang, each helium nucleus grabbed two electrons and became neutral. Put H\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e and He together and you have the universe’s first molecule, HeH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo this day no one has ever detected any helium hydride in the early universe; that would require the unprecedented feat of looking across more than 13 billion light-years of space to the dawn of time and discerning the faint spectral line that the molecule produces. In April 2019, however, astronomers led by Rolf Güsten of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany reported finding \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1090-x\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ethe long-sought molecule right here in the Milky Way\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGüsten’s team made the discovery not with a spacecraft but with a specialized airplane that flies above nearly all of the atmosphere’s water vapor, which blocks infrared radiation. The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy hunted for the coveted molecule using a telescope with a sensitive new high-resolution spectrometer. This instrument successfully detected the far-infrared signature of HeH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e at a wavelength of 149 micrometers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGüsten and his colleagues succeeded by searching the same nebula where their predecessors had failed: NGC 7027 in the constellation Cygnus. Here, about 600 years ago, an aging star known as a red giant shed its atmosphere — something our own sun will do in about 7.8 billion years. This exposed the dying star’s hot core, which shines at a blistering 190,000 kelvins (340,000 degrees Fahrenheit) and emits extreme ultraviolet light that tears electrons from helium atoms, creating He\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e. Combine that with neutral hydrogen atoms from other parts of the nebula and you have HeH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e. In the early universe it was the other way around — charged hydrogen and neutral helium — but the end result was the same: HeH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e, the first molecule to form after the big bang.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s the end of a long saga,” says Paul Goldsmith, an astronomer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was not involved with the discovery. The detection proves that the calculations predicting the exotic molecule’s existence were correct, lending credence to expectations that the molecule did indeed take shape soon after the universe’s birth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere might be other noble gas molecules, too. In space, neon atoms greatly outnumber argon, so neonium, or NeH\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e, could exist. If so, its abundance and the places it exists will further illuminate conditions in the interstellar medium. On the other hand, krypton is so rare that kryptonium probably poses little threat to any interstellar Superman, and xenon is rarer still.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it’s a vast universe with temperatures and densities that vary wildly from place to place and differ dramatically from those on Earth. Somewhere, in the nook of some distant interstellar cloud, the most unlikely atoms may have come together to create molecules even more bizarre than any yet found, awaiting only an intrepid observer to detect their spectral signature in the depths of space.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-info\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-doi\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e10.1146/knowable-121119-1\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-author\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"http://KenCroswell.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eKen Croswell\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is an astronomer and author.

As a consequence, certain small side streets end up being the fastest way to get from Point A to Point B. People here call them “cut-throughs.” These issues affect where people go grocery shopping, where they get gas and what kind of establishments they use.

For example, think about barbershops and hair salons. In the African American community and other ethnic groups where the management of your hair is an important part of your self-presentation, you could easily end up going to a barbershop weekly or biweekly, so you’re going to run into the same people 25 or 50 times a year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was an interesting study published in the 1990s that looked at \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.crcpress.com/Facing-the-Mirror-Older-Women-and-Beauty-Shop-Culture/Furman/p/book/9780415915243\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eelderly Jewish women in hair salons\u003c/a\u003e.

At others, like a beer garden, you have long tables where everybody just sits collectively and drinks beer, which is more equalizing.

The only way to make a friend, gain a collaborator or find a mate was in the flesh, face to face. The internet — as well as texting and other forms of electronic communication — has changed all that, but Harvard sociologist Mario Small argues that the physical spaces we inhabit still make a big difference in our social lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn an article in the \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Sociology\u003c/em\u003e, Small and his graduate student Laura Adler  \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-soc-073018-022707\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ereview nearly a century of research\u003c/a\u003e exploring the role of space in the formation of social ties. This work examines how certain places, from city parks and barbershops to office watercoolers and coffee stations, foster social connections. It also shows how architecture and urban design can alter social interactions in unexpected ways, often by influencing how people move through a building or a city. People tend to think of their social lives as products of their own choices — but, says Small, spatial factors exert more influence than we realize.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eKnowable Magazine\u003c/em\u003e spoke with Small about what’s changing in the internet era — and just as importantly, what’s not. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBefore the internet, what were the most important factors influencing how people meet and form social connections?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor as long as anybody has studied this question, the precondition for meeting anybody and forming a new social tie has been coming into contact with them in a physical space. As a result, there’s been a lot of work on the importance of proximity to interpersonal relations. It can be shown in a whole bunch of different ways that the more physically close you are to someone, the greater the probability that you get to know them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a very simple but powerful study from the 1930s that looked at \u003ca href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1086/216031\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ehow people found their spouses\u003c/a\u003e.

One-third of the marriages were between people who lived within five blocks of each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother famous study, in the 1950s, was based on the dorms at MIT that were built for returning war veterans and their families. The researchers found that residents who lived closer to one another were \u003ca href=\\\"https://archive.org/details/socialpressuresi00fest\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003emore likely to get to know each other\u003c/a\u003e, but there were also other features of the configuration of the space that mattered. The way you got to the second-floor apartments was through stairs on the exterior of the building, and the people whose apartments were closer to the stairs were more likely to get to know other people in the building than the people whose apartments were not close to the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecause the stairs forced people to go by those apartments more often?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExactly.

It wasn’t simply how close their offices were, but whether they crossed paths on their way into the building or on the way to places like the staff restroom or the principal’s office. The organization of work spaces can have an impact on how people collaborate. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo these factors play out on a larger scale in cities?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbsolutely. Think about the role of highways, bridges and the ease of transit between one space and another. Boston is a very old city with a lot of curvy streets that just sort of follow the growth of the city. As a consequence, certain small side streets end up being the fastest way to get from Point A to Point B. People here call them “cut-throughs.” These issues affect where people go grocery shopping, where they get gas and what kind of establishments they use. And all of these things in turn affect who runs into whom over the course of their daily activities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Hobart, Australia, there was a bridge that connected the eastern and western parts of the city, and at some point the bridge collapsed. Researchers found that people visited their friends — and even family — on the other side of the river \u003ca href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-8733(80)90007-6\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ea lot less than they did before\u003c/a\u003e. But it wasn’t that they became more socially isolated. They also increased their contact with people on their own side. What’s really interesting is that when they rebuilt the bridge, some of those changes persisted. People ended up visiting friends and family across the river less than they had before because of the new ties they had formed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo certain kinds of spaces promote social interaction more than others?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s some evidence that the degree to which the interactions in a space are frequent and intense, the more likely you are to form ties. For example, think about barbershops and hair salons. In the African American community and other ethnic groups where the management of your hair is an important part of your self-presentation, you could easily end up going to a barbershop weekly or biweekly, so you’re going to run into the same people 25 or 50 times a year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was an interesting study published in the 1990s that looked at \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.crcpress.com/Facing-the-Mirror-Older-Women-and-Beauty-Shop-Culture/Furman/p/book/9780415915243\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eelderly Jewish women in hair salons\u003c/a\u003e. The women were going there repeatedly and had to sit captive for a long period of time. They ended up developing friendships, but it’s not as if they were necessarily going there for the purpose of making friends. I think this is key. If you want to meet people, your best strategy might be going to places where people are forced to interact repeatedly and intensely, meaning you’re forced to actually interact with people while you’re there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can give you another example from my own \u003ca href=\\\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/mariosmall/unanticipated-gains\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eresearch on childcare centers\u003c/a\u003e. At a lot of centers the only thing they ask of you is to pick up your kid and give them a check. But there are other centers that regularly run activities, like taking the kids apple-picking or to the zoo, and they need parents to participate. That kind of focused activity — forcing you to do something or play a certain role — makes it more likely that you’ll form friendships.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePeople often talk about cafes and bars as good places to meet people, but it sounds like maybe they’re not?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt depends on the bar. There’s a very interesting book by [sociologist] Ray Oldenburg that talks about the \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.dacapopress.com/titles/ray-oldenburg-phd/the-great-good-place/9781569246818/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003echaracteristics of different kinds of drinking establishments\u003c/a\u003e. Some bars are more formal than others — the tables are arranged for parties of two, and you order from your table and get served a fancy martini, which has to be drunk carefully and is a kind of status signal. At others, like a beer garden, you have long tables where everybody just sits collectively and drinks beer, which is more equalizing. Oldenburg makes the case that the more equalizing the space, the more likely it is to foster interactions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere’s something a bit unsettling about the idea that the spaces we find ourselves in are, at least to some extent, choosing our friends for us.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think there’s a tendency to believe that we’re agents of our own destiny far more than we are.

The makeup of the field changed significantly after World War II, and its practitioners became much more middle class. One reason is there were a lot more jobs available, particularly at state universities. And you started to be able to get grants for fieldwork that wasn’t based on looking for objects or spectacular finds.

The older view of the Maya was of a non-urban, peaceful people ruled by priest-astronomers. The elaborate temples people had found at Tikal and elsewhere were thought to be merely ceremonial centers with minimal populations, and not cities in their own right. But mapping projects at Tikal and other places showed that they weren’t just ceremonial centers — there were large numbers of remains of houses. These were actually urban centers of some kind. That totally changed the understanding of the pre-Columbian Maya.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did you choose to focus on the archaeology of commoners?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are really two answers to that. One is, I was a student of Willey’s. I started in 1965 on a project in the tropical rainforest of Guatemala that was looking at the full range of Maya remains. So I was thrust into that. But also it was related to my general interest, which was: How do we understand the development through time of Maya civilization? Clearly, if you were going to ask questions like that and get useful answers, you had to look at the full range of ancient Maya society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you study settlement patterns?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe want to get a sense of the distribution of all the kinds of housing and how they’re situated on the landscape, and in particular find information about the inhabitants of the different kinds of architecture through detailed collection of materials on the surface, and excavation where that was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the projects that I co-directed was at the site of \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/laii_research/22/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eSayil\u003c/a\u003e in northern Yucatan, south of modern-day Merida. We wanted first of all just to produce a map of the urban area, so we could get some idea of the extent and nature of the structures. One reason we chose to work at Sayil is that there had been very little disturbance after the 16th century. Where there had been a wooden thatched house, the single row of stones that supported the wooden poles of the walls was still there, so you could actually see the layout of rooms, the platforms they might have been built on, and so forth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-right\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg alt=\\\"Photograph of a man crouched down brushing dirt.

Could we get a sense of household composition? How many rooms would a family have had? What would we find in the kitchen area? One of the interesting things we found is that open spaces between houses, which used to be thought of as small plazas or something, in fact were vegetable gardens where they’d been growing beans, squash, tomatoes and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe found stone tools made of obsidian, which is not available locally. So you start getting into questions of trade. Economically, where could you find marketplaces? What was being sold there? Were goods accessible to both elite and non-elite, or are some things available only to one and not the other? All of those let you ask questions about how the ancient society functioned, and also how this might have changed through time. It’s a much richer picture of pre-Columbian ancient Maya society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe richer picture we’re getting of the 100 percent is aided by tools that archaeologists 50 years ago just didn’t have available. In terms of settlement-pattern mapping, one of the huge technical breakthroughs in recent years is remote sensing, particularly LIDAR, where low-flying aircraft or drones send down laser beams and you can see the ground without the trees. You can see stone courses. You can see the remains of houses, causeways, roads, defensive fortifications. That’s going to make the mapping of sites much simpler, particularly in difficult situations like tropical rainforest or a heavily wooded area. We’re able to cover much bigger areas with much greater detail and accuracy than ever before. New LIDAR-based studies in the Southern Maya Lowlands are showing that many pre-Columbian Maya cities were more extensive than previously thought, although these new data are awaiting confirmation by on-the-ground research.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat were the lives of commoners like?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, what we learned is it’s difficult to talk about Maya peoples as a whole at any one time. Throughout the Maya area — and that covers parts of modern-day Mexico, Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador — there was a great deal of variability, both through space and through time. Someone living in a small town in Northern Yucatan may be different from Maya living in the highlands of Guatemala or Honduras.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an agricultural society. But clearly you had artisans of all sorts. Some of them are family-based, producing pottery, stone tools, decorative materials; others — for example, weavers or those making especially beautiful painted pottery — might be supported by the elite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHas looking at the whole picture given scholars a different view of postclassical Maya civilization?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the best sites for understanding that is the city of Mayapan, not too far from modern-day Merida in the Yucatan. There’s been work going on there for a number of years by a large international team. This was a walled city that thrived mainly from the mid-13th to mid-15th centuries. It was thought to be a decadent period — Maya gone downhill — because you didn’t have these large investments in beautiful architecture, in the temples and palaces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut we found that economically and socially, things were just as complex, if not more complex. The rulers of the city weren’t sinking their capital into grand architecture or elaborate tombs, they were using it to develop warehouses, trading routes, boats — all the infrastructure of local and long-distance trade. To my mind, that’s not decadent at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-left\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg alt=\\\"Photograph of stone ruins.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/318/P-mayapan-yucatan_2.jpg\\\" title=\\\"Mayapan ruins\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n        \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ruins of Mayapan, in Yucatan, Mexico, abandoned in the 15th century, has fewer and less elaborate temples and large buildings than older sites like Tikal.

They wanted spectacular finds — temples and palaces, not the remains of perishable structures of everyday life. They wanted royal burials, such as King Tut’s tomb, the royal treasures of Ur, great sculpture, murals, beautiful pottery, jade, what have you. They were looking for materials that they could bring back and display in museums.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd why did that change?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUntil the middle of the 20th century, much of archaeology was also carried out by people of wealth. The makeup of the field changed significantly after World War II, and its practitioners became much more middle class. One reason is there were a lot more jobs available, particularly at state universities. And you started to be able to get grants for fieldwork that wasn’t based on looking for objects or spectacular finds. All of this is related to the switch from the 1 percent to the 99 percent, as I’ve flippantly called it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the Maya area specifically, the galvanizer was \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/node/70\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eGordon Willey\u003c/a\u003e at Harvard. He had already been a pioneer in what was called the settlement pattern approach: He wanted to see the whole settlement of an archaeological site, not just the major buildings. He was just as interested in mapping the remains of perishable wooden thatched houses, what little was left, as in stone temples and palaces. It’s not that houses of ancient Maya peasantry had been ignored, but Willey was the first to concentrate attention on these and say: How can we understand Maya society as a whole?\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003caside class=\\\"promo -left\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"header\\\"\u003eYou May Also Like\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n      \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n\\n      \\n    \u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis concern with settlement pattern, with looking at the 100 percent instead of just the 1 percent, not only broadened our understanding, but completely changed it. The older view of the Maya was of a non-urban, peaceful people ruled by priest-astronomers. The elaborate temples people had found at Tikal and elsewhere were thought to be merely ceremonial centers with minimal populations, and not cities in their own right. But mapping projects at Tikal and other places showed that they weren’t just ceremonial centers — there were large numbers of remains of houses. These were actually urban centers of some kind. That totally changed the understanding of the pre-Columbian Maya.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did you choose to focus on the archaeology of commoners?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are really two answers to that. One is, I was a student of Willey’s. I started in 1965 on a project in the tropical rainforest of Guatemala that was looking at the full range of Maya remains. So I was thrust into that. But also it was related to my general interest, which was: How do we understand the development through time of Maya civilization? Clearly, if you were going to ask questions like that and get useful answers, you had to look at the full range of ancient Maya society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you study settlement patterns?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe want to get a sense of the distribution of all the kinds of housing and how they’re situated on the landscape, and in particular find information about the inhabitants of the different kinds of architecture through detailed collection of materials on the surface, and excavation where that was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the projects that I co-directed was at the site of \u003ca href=\\\"https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/laii_research/22/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eSayil\u003c/a\u003e in northern Yucatan, south of modern-day Merida. We wanted first of all just to produce a map of the urban area, so we could get some idea of the extent and nature of the structures. One reason we chose to work at Sayil is that there had been very little disturbance after the 16th century. Where there had been a wooden thatched house, the single row of stones that supported the wooden poles of the walls was still there, so you could actually see the layout of rooms, the platforms they might have been built on, and so forth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also did a little \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/jfa.1989.16.3.273\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eexcavation of these more perishable structures\u003c/a\u003e, so we could fill in a little more. Could we get a sense of household composition? How many rooms would a family have had? What would we find in the kitchen area? One of the interesting things we found is that open spaces between houses, which used to be thought of as small plazas or something, in fact were vegetable gardens where they’d been growing beans, squash, tomatoes and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe found stone tools made of obsidian, which is not available locally. So you start getting into questions of trade. Economically, where could you find marketplaces? What was being sold there? Were goods accessible to both elite and non-elite, or are some things available only to one and not the other? All of those let you ask questions about how the ancient society functioned, and also how this might have changed through time. It’s a much richer picture of pre-Columbian ancient Maya society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe richer picture we’re getting of the 100 percent is aided by tools that archaeologists 50 years ago just didn’t have available. In terms of settlement-pattern mapping, one of the huge technical breakthroughs in recent years is remote sensing, particularly LIDAR, where low-flying aircraft or drones send down laser beams and you can see the ground without the trees. You can see stone courses. You can see the remains of houses, causeways, roads, defensive fortifications. That’s going to make the mapping of sites much simpler, particularly in difficult situations like tropical rainforest or a heavily wooded area. We’re able to cover much bigger areas with much greater detail and accuracy than ever before. New LIDAR-based studies in the Southern Maya Lowlands are showing that many pre-Columbian Maya cities were more extensive than previously thought, although these new data are awaiting confirmation by on-the-ground research.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat were the lives of commoners like?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, what we learned is it’s difficult to talk about Maya peoples as a whole at any one time. Throughout the Maya area — and that covers parts of modern-day Mexico, Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador — there was a great deal of variability, both through space and through time. Someone living in a small town in Northern Yucatan may be different from Maya living in the highlands of Guatemala or Honduras.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an agricultural society. But clearly you had artisans of all sorts. Some of them are family-based, producing pottery, stone tools, decorative materials; others — for example, weavers or those making especially beautiful painted pottery — might be supported by the elite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHas looking at the whole picture given scholars a different view of postclassical Maya civilization?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the best sites for understanding that is the city of Mayapan, not too far from modern-day Merida in the Yucatan. There’s been work going on there for a number of years by a large international team. This was a walled city that thrived mainly from the mid-13th to mid-15th centuries. It was thought to be a decadent period — Maya gone downhill — because you didn’t have these large investments in beautiful architecture, in the temples and palaces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut we found that economically and socially, things were just as complex, if not more complex. The rulers of the city weren’t sinking their capital into grand architecture or elaborate tombs, they were using it to develop warehouses, trading routes, boats — all the infrastructure of local and long-distance trade. To my mind, that’s not decadent at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre there lessons we can learn from the Maya that apply today?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClassical Maya civilization collapsed in the 9th century, but the Maya didn’t disappear — there are over 10 million Maya speakers today. What allowed them to continue after their cities collapsed? This gets into questions of population growth, of \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/sustainability/2017/climate-change-can-set-stage-violence\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ewarfare, drought and climate change\u003c/a\u003e, which are all relevant.

What were they successful at? What did not work? How were they resilient in the face of drought or warfare?

So scientists like Cox are probing and tweaking farm practices to optimize soil health, and a soil-centric carbon marketplace has begun to emerge offering farmers financial incentives to adopt these practices. Now, as technologies allow farmers to share more data and monitor their soils more readily than ever, new tools are available to further cultivate this multipronged solution sitting right beneath their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo harness this momentum, Cox and colleagues have launched an ambitious project to pool all these new data into a single online platform and encourage researchers and farmers to share strategies on how best to keep carbon underground.

Soil carbon storage, he says, is a no-brainer tactic in mitigating climate change, though it is limited in how far it can take us: At their best, global soils can store just 2 to 5 of the roughly 37 gigatons of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere each year. And, over time, they can become saturated and stop absorbing more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut given all the ways that soil carbon boosts farm productivity, there’s no reason not to include it in the suite of tools used to meet the Paris Agreement, Smith says. “Just about everything it does is beneficial.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eShoots to soils \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCarbon worms its way into soil through several pathways that research has recently helped clarify.

But this is just a fraction of the story, Banwart says. “Plants are actually pushing carbon, minute by minute as they are photosynthesizing, out into the soil.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUp to a third of the sugars plants create during photosynthesis goes not to leaf and stem growth, but to growth of fungi that rapidly spread out of plant roots and into the soil — sometimes expanding by up to a centimeter per day.

In the lab, researchers can expose plants to carbon-14 — a radioactive carbon isotope — and use imagery to track the isotope as it travels from the air, into leaves and down through roots within hours. “You’ll suddenly find, within a day, bright spots on that image out at the tips of these fungi,” Banwart says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese images show that carbon storage calls for more than just compost — it requires an ongoing boost to those underground alliances. But many conventional farming practices hurt rather than help those relationships, Cox says. The heavy steel plows that churn up topsoil during tillage, for example, rip fragile fungal threads that facilitate symbiosis. Low-till or no-till methods keep those threads intact by more delicately managing fields.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut low-till methods take more time and effort than quick-tilling rides through fields on a tractor, and this can push farmers away from these practices. That’s especially since the capacity of soils to hold carbon — and thus crop yield and overall farm health — have largely been anecdotal, Cox says. He hopes that the data-driven evidence compiled through OpenTEAM will help persuade more farmers to adopt soil-friendly practices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCox describes OpenTEAM as an “ecosystem” of soil maps, satellite imagery, app software and other soil analysis technologies that have existed scattered around the Internet but have never been pulled together on a single platform.

The hummocky coastal landscape has begun to brown for the winter, and the scraggly pastures feel lifeless as we shiver in freezing rain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Cox, research director at the 600-acre Wolfe’s Neck Center for Agriculture and the Environment, paints a far brighter portrait of these dreary fields. He describes networks of fungi bustling with activity beneath the wilting grass — feeding on sugars at tips of roots, sponging up rainwater and extending tendrils that nourish the pasture with nutrients. To him, this ground is a subsurface garden teeming with life. “Soil is not built, it’s grown,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe key ingredient fueling all this life: carbon. Plants generate it through photosynthesis and \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/living-world/2019/climate-changes-so-does-life-planets-soils\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003etrade it with soil microbes \u003c/a\u003ein exchange for nutrients. It’s a virtuous cycle — the more carbon that plants send toward the soil, the more plentiful microbes become, and the healthier the plants grow. And because carbon locked up in soils is carbon not floating in our atmosphere, carbon-rich soils make for a healthier climate, too, Cox says. “It’s very difficult to improve soil health and not have a climate benefit.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLush soils appeal not just to farmers but, increasingly, to policymakers and entrepreneurs scrambling to slow climate change, with mounting pressure from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement that calls on nations to keep global warming from reaching 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels this century. (The United States has taken steps to \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.state.gov/on-the-u-s-withdrawal-from-the-paris-agreement/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ewithdraw from the agreement\u003c/a\u003e, but nearly 200 other nations remain committed.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.ipcc.ch/2019/08/08/land-is-a-critical-resource_srccl/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003egrowing body of research\u003c/a\u003e from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recognizes sustainable agriculture as key to slowing warming. So scientists like Cox are probing and tweaking farm practices to optimize soil health, and a soil-centric carbon marketplace has begun to emerge offering farmers financial incentives to adopt these practices. Now, as technologies allow farmers to share more data and monitor their soils more readily than ever, new tools are available to further cultivate this multipronged solution sitting right beneath their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo harness this momentum, Cox and colleagues have launched an ambitious project to pool all these new data into a single online platform and encourage researchers and farmers to share strategies on how best to keep carbon underground. Called OpenTEAM — Open Technology Ecosystem for Agricultural Management — the project aims to woo farmers to change their practices in relatively minor ways that could eventually have major impacts on their bottom line, and the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo far, the team consists of about 20 regional “hub farms” around the country including research farms, production farms and combinations of the two like the Wolfe’s Neck Center, which sells all its milk to the organic yogurt and dairy company Stonyfield. These hub farms will host field trials of the OpenTEAM software during the 2020 growing season to help iron out kinks and get other farmers on board and comfortable with the system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s exactly the sort of collaborative platform that’s needed,” says Peter Smith, a soil scientist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. Soil carbon storage, he says, is a no-brainer tactic in mitigating climate change, though it is limited in how far it can take us: At their best, global soils can store just 2 to 5 of the roughly 37 gigatons of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere each year. And, over time, they can become saturated and stop absorbing more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut given all the ways that soil carbon boosts farm productivity, there’s no reason not to include it in the suite of tools used to meet the Paris Agreement, Smith says. “Just about everything it does is beneficial.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eShoots to soils \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCarbon worms its way into soil through several pathways that research has recently helped clarify. It turns out that living plants play a much larger role in sending carbon underground than scientists had once thought, says Steven Banwart, a soil scientist at the University of Leeds and author of \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-earth-063016-020544\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ea report on soil ecology\u003c/a\u003e in the 2019  \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFarmers have perceived dead plant material as a key source of soil carbon (plants are roughly 45 percent carbon), and mulches and composts as the means to get it into farm fields. But this is just a fraction of the story, Banwart says. “Plants are actually pushing carbon, minute by minute as they are photosynthesizing, out into the soil.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUp to a third of the sugars plants create during photosynthesis goes not to leaf and stem growth, but to growth of fungi that rapidly spread out of plant roots and into the soil — sometimes expanding by up to a centimeter per day. In return, the fungi offer up nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus that plants can’t make on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBiologists have known about this symbiosis for years, but new technology allows scientists to quantify it and watch it unfold. In the lab, researchers can expose plants to carbon-14 — a radioactive carbon isotope — and use imagery to track the isotope as it travels from the air, into leaves and down through roots within hours. “You’ll suddenly find, within a day, bright spots on that image out at the tips of these fungi,” Banwart says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese images show that carbon storage calls for more than just compost — it requires an ongoing boost to those underground alliances. But many conventional farming practices hurt rather than help those relationships, Cox says. The heavy steel plows that churn up topsoil during tillage, for example, rip fragile fungal threads that facilitate symbiosis. Low-till or no-till methods keep those threads intact by more delicately managing fields.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut low-till methods take more time and effort than quick-tilling rides through fields on a tractor, and this can push farmers away from these practices. That’s especially since the capacity of soils to hold carbon — and thus crop yield and overall farm health — have largely been anecdotal, Cox says. He hopes that the data-driven evidence compiled through OpenTEAM will help persuade more farmers to adopt soil-friendly practices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCox describes OpenTEAM as an “ecosystem” of soil maps, satellite imagery, app software and other soil analysis technologies that have existed scattered around the Internet but have never been pulled together on a single platform. In many cases, they have been hard to find or difficult to use.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCox hopes pooling these tools will make them collectively stronger and more user-friendly for farmers. A Yale-based group called \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.quickcarbon.org/research-objectives\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eQuick Carbon\u003c/a\u003e, for example, is designing an app to help farmers estimate soil carbon out in fields based on reflectivity (darker soils tend to contain more carbon) using a handheld tool called a reflectometer. It would offer a less cumbersome and less expensive alternative to lab-testing soil samples. But to strengthen those field estimates, Quick Carbon needs ample, well-tested data to calibrate measurements, and OpenTEAM members could help compile them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCox and colleagues are now working to ease the flow of such data so that the information can travel seamlessly from one online platform to the next, with a goal of completing the preliminary setup this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBrewing the incentive \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePooling tools and data like this is “a terrific idea,” says Lini Wollenberg, a natural resource management specialist with CGIAR, a global research consortium, and the University of Vermont. But for the information to really make a change, farmers will need to stick with the methods. Carbon is constantly in flux, and soil accumulations can quickly travel back into the atmosphere as environmental conditions change or as farming practices shift. A farmer practicing no-till methods over several seasons, for example, can fast undo progress by resorting back to tillage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\\\"article-sidebar -right\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-sidebar-text\\\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHealthy soils, healthy budget\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven without joining a soil carbon market, farmers can easily find financial benefits in boosting soil health, says Keith Paustian, a soil ecologist at Colorado State University who studies the capture of carbon in soil and has held leading roles on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen farmers plant cover crops rather than leaving their soils bare in the winter, for example, more carbon gets locked up underground, weed pressures diminish, nutrient levels increase and pest pressures decline because the overall field ecosystem is healthier. This means, Paustian says, that farmers can spend less money on pesticides and fertilizers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e—   \u003cem\u003eLaura Poppick\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne way to encourage farmers to stick with carbon-friendly practices is to provide an immediate financial incentive. That’s what the Seattle-based startup Nori is doing, by building a marketplace that rewards farmers for storing carbon in their fields. (Nori is a partner of OpenTEAM, along with more than a dozen other companies, nonprofits and research groups tackling soil health from different angles.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrough Nori, farmers commit to adopting a suite of sustainable practices — such as low-till methods or cover cropping to keep carbon-friendly root masses intact year-round. At their best, these practices can increase carbon storage by up to about 1.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide per acre per year, Nori estimates, and farmers can sell what are called Nori Carbon Removal Tonnes (NRTs) to individuals or corporations interested in taking climate action. Once farmers have chosen their methods, Nori connects them with an accredited third-party verifier who estimates how much carbon their practices will store over a 10-year period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“No one is being forced to pay for carbon removal, but they see its value,” says Christophe Jospe, Nori cofounder and chief development officer.

I thought he was joking, but then I became friends with him and, turns out, he was not joking at all. He was annoyed by the terrible representations of Louisiana foods elsewhere.

Certain foods here are quintessential New Orleans foods, but they are definitely not, in many respects, local. Red beans and rice is a dish that people eat here on Mondays traditionally. Rice is grown in Louisiana — that could be local, although not in New Orleans, but certainly in Louisiana. The beans, on the other hand, pretty much don’t ever come from Louisiana. But it’s a quintessential New Orleans dish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo that raised this question: What the heck is local? If a quintessential dish is made of ingredients that are generally not from here, is it still a local dish? That’s what got me into this, thinking about these interesting contradictions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt seems like you’re talking about a couple of different things: what is physically local and what is culturally local. So is there a single definition of local food?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere isn’t a definitive definition of it. For instance, there’s a famous article by anthropologist Melissa Caldwell about \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7811/7f99b46f80d417f6ce110bab2ccd17d31b37.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003ethe reception of McDonald’s in Moscow\u003c/a\u003e. McDonald’s makes a point of saying that it uses Russian produce, and in this and other ways, the lines are blurred. McDonald’s is clearly not a Russian concept — in fact, it’s a pretty strong symbol of America. Yet it becomes local.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the things that I’ve thought about a lot is when you take a foreign ingredient and say, “I want this to be local.” Chefs do this all the time. A chef will say, “I really want to cook with this particular ingredient. It’s not local, so rather than importing it, I’m going to go to a farmer and ask, ‘Will you grow this for me?’ ” When I was in New York, I took a tour at the Italian food market and restaurant Eataly, and they talked about wanting a particular kind of wheat to make their bread. So they went to some farmers in upstate New York and said, “Can you grow this variety of wheat for us? We’ll buy it if you grow it.” And the farmers started growing this variety of wheat that they weren’t growing before.

We have cows that are raised in the United States that are then exported to Mexico for butchery, then some parts of the cows are reexported to the United States. At some point it becomes difficult to say, “Is this an American cow or a Mexican cow?” So in terms of  “What is local?” it depends on what you are trying to accomplish and what kind of cultural issues you care about. There is no one answer, but it’s a great question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEven if there is no one definition, in many circles local food has a positive connotation. What emotional and ideological qualities do you think people ascribe to it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think what people are really interested in is the local community they create around food. They’re also trying to do something good for a local business when they go to a local food purveyor or shop at a locally owned grocery store instead of shopping at a chain. And they feel like they are helping do something environmentally positive. There is a lot of fuel involved in getting food across the planet, so if you can shorten that distance, you’re helping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you think the positive connotation is warranted?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think yes, mostly, as long as they’re doing it for the right reasons. You go to the farmers market and you meet people and you create this kind of third space — neither family nor business. It gives you a stronger sense of community, and I think irrespective of what the actual food is, it’s positive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt can become negative when it incites nationalism and xenophobia. And it can also become arbitrary in some ways. After all, a lot of the wine that I can buy at local wine stores comes from small producers that happen to be in France or Germany, and the only reason these producers can stay in business is because they have this global export.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt also becomes dubious when big corporations project themselves as local or as small businesses when in fact they’re not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes the local food movement deal with other issues around food production?

A lot of the chickens that people eat, particularly in the US, are industrially produced and processed in horrible conditions where a lot of the workers are immigrants who are paid poorly and work in abysmal conditions. It’s environmentally bad, it’s bad for the workers, it’s bad for the chickens, it’s bad for the consumers. It’s just bad, except of course for the part about it being cheap — that’s great.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we ate local, would that be better?

Adding to that, one of the ways that people have written about making food more local is an industrialization of food production in cities: interior farms inside of factories. And then there’s rooftop gardening and urban farming; those things are already happening. It’s a new kind of farming right in the middle of the city and that certainly seems local. I have no idea if technology makes things more or less “local” in people’s minds. If it’s just a question of distance, it doesn’t matter if it’s a drone or me that’s picking it, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you think the future holds?

First, it probably is, at least partly, a question of fashion. People use food for the purpose of social distinction, and local food has in many ways replaced exotic imported food for purposes of showing off one’s knowledge, taste and sophistication. In the US, for instance, rather than ordering an imported beer, now we try to aim for the hyper-local to demonstrate that we know what is good. There are many examples of fashionable trends that recede whenever the next fashion appears.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut second, there are underlying issues around globalization, sustainability, community and justice that local food may help people address.

Some with environmental concerns lean toward local because food grown nearby requires less energy for transportation. Others find it reassuring to meet a farmer and know where their food comes from and how it was grown.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOthers may think of local food as fresher, more nutritious and more likely to be grown organically, or they view “local” as a way to boost local economies and invest in their communities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the very definition of local food is elusive. If it’s about food that was grown nearby, how nearby should that be? Fifty miles away? One hundred? Somewhere within one’s state or country? And for those whose definition of “local” means pride in regional cuisines, does it matter where the ingredients were grown?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuch questions preoccupy David Beriss, an anthropologist at the University of New Orleans focusing on food systems and the author of an article on \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-anthro-102317-050249\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ehow people define local food and what it means to them\u003c/a\u003e in the 2019  \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Anthropology\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eKnowable Magazine\u003c/em\u003e spoke with Beriss about food miles, urban farming, immigrant labor and, of course, red beans and rice. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat made you turn to local food as a topic of study?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI got interested in studying food, in part, because of the curious intensity of devotion, here, to the idea of a New Orleans food culture. In 1997, writer-filmmaker Lolis Eric Elie wrote an article in the \u003cem\u003eTimes-Picayune\u003c/em\u003e about the need to require anybody who purports to cook Louisiana food outside of Louisiana to follow certain culinary rules. I thought he was joking, but then I became friends with him and, turns out, he was not joking at all. He was annoyed by the terrible representations of Louisiana foods elsewhere. And I thought, “Well, that’s odd,” but people really seem to be into that kind of localism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few years later, you had people like writers Gary Nabhan and Barbara Kingsolver saying, “I’m going to eat only foods grown within 200 miles of my home” — to make a point that you can do that, even in this age of globalization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that led to another thought. Certain foods here are quintessential New Orleans foods, but they are definitely not, in many respects, local. Red beans and rice is a dish that people eat here on Mondays traditionally. Rice is grown in Louisiana — that could be local, although not in New Orleans, but certainly in Louisiana. The beans, on the other hand, pretty much don’t ever come from Louisiana. But it’s a quintessential New Orleans dish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo that raised this question: What the heck is local? If a quintessential dish is made of ingredients that are generally not from here, is it still a local dish? That’s what got me into this, thinking about these interesting contradictions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt seems like you’re talking about a couple of different things: what is physically local and what is culturally local. So is there a single definition of local food?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere isn’t a definitive definition of it. For instance, there’s a famous article by anthropologist Melissa Caldwell about \u003ca href=\\\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7811/7f99b46f80d417f6ce110bab2ccd17d31b37.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ethe reception of McDonald’s in Moscow\u003c/a\u003e. McDonald’s makes a point of saying that it uses Russian produce, and in this and other ways, the lines are blurred. McDonald’s is clearly not a Russian concept — in fact, it’s a pretty strong symbol of America. Yet it becomes local.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the things that I’ve thought about a lot is when you take a foreign ingredient and say, “I want this to be local.” Chefs do this all the time. A chef will say, “I really want to cook with this particular ingredient. It’s not local, so rather than importing it, I’m going to go to a farmer and ask, ‘Will you grow this for me?’ ” When I was in New York, I took a tour at the Italian food market and restaurant Eataly, and they talked about wanting a particular kind of wheat to make their bread. So they went to some farmers in upstate New York and said, “Can you grow this variety of wheat for us? We’ll buy it if you grow it.” And the farmers started growing this variety of wheat that they weren’t growing before. So now it’s local, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust recently, there was a debate over what defines something as American. We have cows that are raised in the United States that are then exported to Mexico for butchery, then some parts of the cows are reexported to the United States. At some point it becomes difficult to say, “Is this an American cow or a Mexican cow?” So in terms of  “What is local?” it depends on what you are trying to accomplish and what kind of cultural issues you care about. There is no one answer, but it’s a great question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEven if there is no one definition, in many circles local food has a positive connotation. What emotional and ideological qualities do you think people ascribe to it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think what people are really interested in is the local community they create around food. They’re also trying to do something good for a local business when they go to a local food purveyor or shop at a locally owned grocery store instead of shopping at a chain. And they feel like they are helping do something environmentally positive. There is a lot of fuel involved in getting food across the planet, so if you can shorten that distance, you’re helping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you think the positive connotation is warranted?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think yes, mostly, as long as they’re doing it for the right reasons. You go to the farmers market and you meet people and you create this kind of third space — neither family nor business. It gives you a stronger sense of community, and I think irrespective of what the actual food is, it’s positive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt can become negative when it incites nationalism and xenophobia. And it can also become arbitrary in some ways. After all, a lot of the wine that I can buy at local wine stores comes from small producers that happen to be in France or Germany, and the only reason these producers can stay in business is because they have this global export.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt also becomes dubious when big corporations project themselves as local or as small businesses when in fact they’re not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes the local food movement deal with other issues around food production? Farm labor conditions? Animal welfare? Social justice issues, things like that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t necessarily help with them. Take industrial poultry production. A lot of the chickens that people eat, particularly in the US, are industrially produced and processed in horrible conditions where a lot of the workers are immigrants who are paid poorly and work in abysmal conditions. It’s environmentally bad, it’s bad for the workers, it’s bad for the chickens, it’s bad for the consumers. It’s just bad, except of course for the part about it being cheap — that’s great.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we ate local, would that be better? I think for the farmers, it’s probably better because you’re buying directly from the person who raised the chickens and they get the money directly. But for other purposes it may not be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we want to solve the problems that the workers confront, like dangerous working conditions and bad wages, maybe the way to address those is directly. Can they work without getting their hands cut off? Can they support their families? I don’t know if localness is really an answer to those questions. It doesn’t seem like it is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it better to buy something local that was produced in a more conventional way or something that’s organic that was produced farther away?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s really hard to weigh in on environmental questions like this. Is it better for me to buy meat from the farmers market that’s raised nearby in a conventional way, or is it better for me to buy meat from halfway across the world that’s raised in a free range, grass-fed manner?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a lot of what writer Michael Pollan calls \u003ca href=\\\"https://michaelpollan.com/articles-archive/naturally/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e“industrial organic”\u003c/a\u003e out there.

Adding to that, one of the ways that people have written about making food more local is an industrialization of food production in cities: interior farms inside of factories. And then there’s rooftop gardening and urban farming; those things are already happening. It’s a new kind of farming right in the middle of the city and that certainly seems local. I have no idea if technology makes things more or less “local” in people’s minds. If it’s just a question of distance, it doesn’t matter if it’s a drone or me that’s picking it, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you think the future holds? Do you think local food will continue to be a trend or will people move on to some other thing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have at least two hypotheses. First, it probably is, at least partly, a question of fashion. People use food for the purpose of social distinction, and local food has in many ways replaced exotic imported food for purposes of showing off one’s knowledge, taste and sophistication. In the US, for instance, rather than ordering an imported beer, now we try to aim for the hyper-local to demonstrate that we know what is good. There are many examples of fashionable trends that recede whenever the next fashion appears.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut second, there are underlying issues around globalization, sustainability, community and justice that local food may help people address. Even if the fashion for sophisticated people to show off their knowledge of local food passes, it is possible that some kind of deeper set of structures around urban farming or local craft production will become more important as we try to deal with those issues.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-info\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-doi\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e10.1146/knowable-022420-1\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-author\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eStephanie Parker\u003c/b\u003e is a freelance writer and photographer living in Switzerland, where her favorite local food is definitely cheese.

This is very powerful if one considers that these households currently do not have electricity.

Different countries have access to different types of resources. Here in South Africa, it makes sense for us to build renewables. We’ve got a very well-developed grid, and if we’re generating solar or wind power it’s just a matter of connecting those sources to the grid. South Africa has sufficient land to build these power plants. And I think more importantly, because the resource, the solar and wind, is so good in South Africa we can basically build it anywhere in the country without making it significantly less efficient. But some other countries, such as Bangladesh, don’t have as much land suitable for building renewables on a large scale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow long would it take a country like South Africa to make the transition? It gets only about 10 percent of its electricity from renewables today.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSouth Africa is actually at the perfect place to be switching to renewable energy. A lot of our coal power plants will be decommissioned by 2030 to 2040, so we need to start building new capacity. The question is, do we build new coal capacity, new nuclear capacity, or do we build renewables? According to predictions we’ve done, South Africa could have 70 percent to 80 percent from renewables by 2050.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill that happen automatically, or will policy changes be required?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn South Africa, we do need policy intervention because the current policy is not to shift to renewable energy at the pace that’s needed. Numerous studies, including ours, have shown that it’s the least-cost path for the country. But current policy still plans the building of new coal plants to 2050.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe government’s reason is that there’s no transition plan in place for the coal-mining sector. You’ve got lobbying groups who benefit from coal-mining production. You’ve got unions whose workers are in the coal industry. The government needs to find a balance. While you are creating more jobs throughout the economy with renewable energy, coal miners are losing their jobs, so you do need a plan in place that either helps to reskill these workers or, if they are near retirement age, looks at alternative financial arrangements. You need policies in place that think about how to maybe put more manufacturing in coal-mining regions, or wind farms or solar farms there. So those are things that need to be planned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-full\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg alt=\\\"Map shows average wind speeds across the continental US and Alaska, with a high-wind area covering much of the center of the nation.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/397/G-wind-potential-us_2.svg\\\" title=\\\"Widespread winds\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n        \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eMuch of the United States is routinely breezy, as highlighted on this map of average wind speeds, making wind a rich potential source of electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n  \\n          \\n          \\n        \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs that happening?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are plans, but they’re very much in their infancy. If you spoke to me about this two or three years ago, or even maybe at the start of last year, there was really nothing suggesting a move to renewable energy. Whereas now, there’s far stronger support for shifting to renewables. It’s just about getting the policies in place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou’ve noted that energy systems that rely heavily on renewables face what’s called the “systems integration challenge.” Can you explain what that is?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSure. The systems integration challenge is the complexity of always ensuring that there is enough power in the system. The sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow, so there may be periods of time in which a highly renewable-dependent energy system may not be able to produce enough electricity. During this time, one would have to have other technologies to fill the gap.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe challenge is being able to maintain this shifting between technologies in an efficient manner, so that people don’t experience blackouts or brownouts. With a renewable system, one needs to consider where and when it will be windy or sunny, how far into the future we can actually predict this and how the endowment will change over time, particularly in light of climate change. These questions are quite different from the ones of before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis only becomes a challenge when wind and solar contributes more than 20 percent of electricity production. Current levels are quite low in many countries. although there are examples of countries such as Denmark where they are managing a high share quite well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSouth Africa, along with much of Africa actually, is very well-endowed with solar and wind resources. It is therefore highly likely that renewables will always be producing power because when the sun sets we still have wind. For South Africa, estimates show full coverage of demand for about 70 percent of the year, with the remaining 30 percent of the year having coverage of around 70 percent to 90 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-center\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg alt=\\\"Map of South Africa’s solar potential shows high potential across a large area of the country.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/397/G-solar-potential-south-africa_2.svg\\\" title=\\\"Solar abundance\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n        \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSouth Africa has enormous potential for generating solar electricity nationwide, as highlighted in this map showing possible photovoltaic power output over one year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n  \\n          \\n          \\n        \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can the system cover those shortfalls?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is the option to use gas, and with the technological advancement in batteries, storing solar- or wind-produced energy for later is increasingly becoming an option as well. And we have in the past been able to create agreements with industry in which they would shift their use of electricity to times when there is less demand in the system. You can also shift households’ demand for electricity by having a tariff structure where the price is higher when demand normally peaks. That’s been done in other countries, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill clean electricity bring other environmental benefits?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe do need to find ways of further reducing carbon emissions — but that doesn’t necessarily have to come from the power sector. For example, in the transport sector, you can now switch away from fossil fuels to electric vehicles, because you’re using a clean source of electricity. That will reduce emissions. If the transport sector is no longer using fossil fuels, there is no need to produce high volumes of petrol and diesel, so you reduce emissions in the fossil fuel production sector as well.

But what has been such a game changer is the rate at which these prices have fallen. Every year for the last decade, electricity from solar and wind has ended up costing less than experts predicted it would.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRenewable energy is now comparable with the cost of building new coal and nuclear capacity. Existing, older power plants already have the capital investment sunk, so they are cheaper — but, in the case of South Africa at least, many of these plants are reaching retirement ages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis has changed the landscape. There is now a cheap, clean alternative for power generation. There’s no longer this problem of do we decarbonize our power sector and have more expensive electricity — in which case it negatively affects our economy. We’re now finding that because it’s cheaper, it’s actually beneficial to produce greener electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does that affect the wider economy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSwitching to renewables requires far less investment into your power sector than if you were to build new coal or nuclear power plants. That means a lower electricity price, and that has impacts on everything in the economy. A lower electricity price reduces the cost of production, and increases profit. At the same time, it helps households, because spending less on power means you can spend more on other things. From that perspective, you’re actually stimulating the economy when you’re building renewable energy.

Why is that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn many developing countries, not everyone has access to electricity, because the infrastructure required to connect them to the system is not available. Renewable technologies can allow countries to skip the need of having extensive power grids, as energy production can be developed closer to centers of demand and, in the case of solar, can even be placed on people’s roofs. This is very powerful if one considers that these households currently do not have electricity. Even in South Africa, which is considered to be one of the leading countries on the continent in terms of infrastructure development, around 20 percent of people living in rural areas don’t have electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003caside class=\\\"promo -left\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"header\\\"\u003eYou May Also Like\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n      \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e              \\n              \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n\\n      \\n    \u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes the lower cost of renewables mean there is no longer a good reason to build fossil-fuel electric generating plants?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt depends on where in the world you are. Different countries have access to different types of resources. Here in South Africa, it makes sense for us to build renewables. We’ve got a very well-developed grid, and if we’re generating solar or wind power it’s just a matter of connecting those sources to the grid. South Africa has sufficient land to build these power plants. And I think more importantly, because the resource, the solar and wind, is so good in South Africa we can basically build it anywhere in the country without making it significantly less efficient. But some other countries, such as Bangladesh, don’t have as much land suitable for building renewables on a large scale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow long would it take a country like South Africa to make the transition? It gets only about 10 percent of its electricity from renewables today.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSouth Africa is actually at the perfect place to be switching to renewable energy. A lot of our coal power plants will be decommissioned by 2030 to 2040, so we need to start building new capacity. The question is, do we build new coal capacity, new nuclear capacity, or do we build renewables? According to predictions we’ve done, South Africa could have 70 percent to 80 percent from renewables by 2050.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill that happen automatically, or will policy changes be required?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn South Africa, we do need policy intervention because the current policy is not to shift to renewable energy at the pace that’s needed. Numerous studies, including ours, have shown that it’s the least-cost path for the country. But current policy still plans the building of new coal plants to 2050.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe government’s reason is that there’s no transition plan in place for the coal-mining sector. You’ve got lobbying groups who benefit from coal-mining production. You’ve got unions whose workers are in the coal industry. The government needs to find a balance. While you are creating more jobs throughout the economy with renewable energy, coal miners are losing their jobs, so you do need a plan in place that either helps to reskill these workers or, if they are near retirement age, looks at alternative financial arrangements. You need policies in place that think about how to maybe put more manufacturing in coal-mining regions, or wind farms or solar farms there. So those are things that need to be planned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs that happening?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are plans, but they’re very much in their infancy. If you spoke to me about this two or three years ago, or even maybe at the start of last year, there was really nothing suggesting a move to renewable energy. Whereas now, there’s far stronger support for shifting to renewables. It’s just about getting the policies in place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou’ve noted that energy systems that rely heavily on renewables face what’s called the “systems integration challenge.” Can you explain what that is?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSure. The systems integration challenge is the complexity of always ensuring that there is enough power in the system. The sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow, so there may be periods of time in which a highly renewable-dependent energy system may not be able to produce enough electricity. During this time, one would have to have other technologies to fill the gap.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe challenge is being able to maintain this shifting between technologies in an efficient manner, so that people don’t experience blackouts or brownouts. With a renewable system, one needs to consider where and when it will be windy or sunny, how far into the future we can actually predict this and how the endowment will change over time, particularly in light of climate change. These questions are quite different from the ones of before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis only becomes a challenge when wind and solar contributes more than 20 percent of electricity production. Current levels are quite low in many countries. although there are examples of countries such as Denmark where they are managing a high share quite well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSouth Africa, along with much of Africa actually, is very well-endowed with solar and wind resources. It is therefore highly likely that renewables will always be producing power because when the sun sets we still have wind. For South Africa, estimates show full coverage of demand for about 70 percent of the year, with the remaining 30 percent of the year having coverage of around 70 percent to 90 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can the system cover those shortfalls?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is the option to use gas, and with the technological advancement in batteries, storing solar- or wind-produced energy for later is increasingly becoming an option as well. And we have in the past been able to create agreements with industry in which they would shift their use of electricity to times when there is less demand in the system. You can also shift households’ demand for electricity by having a tariff structure where the price is higher when demand normally peaks. That’s been done in other countries, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill clean electricity bring other environmental benefits?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe do need to find ways of further reducing carbon emissions — but that doesn’t necessarily have to come from the power sector. For example, in the transport sector, you can now switch away from fossil fuels to electric vehicles, because you’re using a clean source of electricity. That will reduce emissions. If the transport sector is no longer using fossil fuels, there is no need to produce high volumes of petrol and diesel, so you reduce emissions in the fossil fuel production sector as well. But all this does need government support for all of these things to align.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you optimistic that society will manage the transition to renewables?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am. I’m actually very optimistic about it. I think it’s something that will help significantly in a country like South Africa, where you’ve got the bulk of emissions being produced by the electricity sector. You’ve got industry that is so electricity-intensive, and a lot of that industry is also producing for the export market.

A basic GPS receiver, like the one in your smartphone, determines where you are — to within about 1 to 10 meters — by measuring the arrival time of signals from four or more satellites. With fancier (and more expensive) GPS receivers, scientists can pinpoint their locations down to centimeters or even millimeters. Using that fine-grained information, along with new ways to analyze the signals, researchers are discovering that \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-earth-053018-060203\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eGPS can tell them far more about the planet\u003c/a\u003e than they originally thought it could.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003caside class=\\\"promo -left\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"header\\\"\u003eYou May Also Like\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"eyebrow\\\"\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/technology\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eTechnology\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/technology/2018/humans-beat-robots-hands-down\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eHumans beat robots, hands down\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"eyebrow\\\"\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/society\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eSociety\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2018/unmet-promise-big-data-policing\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eThe unmet promise of Big Data in policing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"eyebrow\\\"\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/term/technology\\\" hreflang=\\\"en\\\"\u003eTechnology\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch3\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/article/technology/2017/robotic-window-human-mind\\\"\u003eA robotic window on the human mind\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/h3\u003e\\n\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"eyebrow\\\"\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/term/technology\\\" hreflang=\\\"en\\\"\u003eTechnology\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch3\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/article/technology/2018/eyes-sky-5-ways-drones-will-change-agriculture\\\"\u003eEyes in the sky: 5 ways drones will change agriculture \u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/h3\u003e\\n\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the last decade, faster and more accurate GPS devices have allowed scientists to illuminate how the ground moves during big earthquakes.

Feel an earthquake\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eFor centuries geoscientists have relied on seismometers, which measure how much the ground is shaking, to assess how big and how bad an earthquake is. GPS receivers served a different purpose — to track geologic processes that happen on much slower scales, such as the rate at which Earth’s great crustal plates grind past one another in the process known as plate tectonics. So GPS might tell scientists the speed at which the opposite sides of the San Andreas Fault are creeping past each other, while seismometers measure the ground shaking when that California fault ruptures in a quake.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMost researchers thought that GPS simply couldn’t measure locations precisely enough, and quickly enough, to be useful in assessing earthquakes. But it turns out that scientists can squeeze extra information out of the signals that GPS satellites transmit to Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThose signals arrive in two components. One is the unique series of ones and zeros, known as the code, that each GPS satellite transmits. The second is a shorter-wavelength “carrier” signal that transmits the code from the satellite. Because the carrier signal has a shorter wavelength — a mere 20 centimeters — compared with the longer wavelength of the code, which can be tens or hundreds of meters, the carrier signal offers a high-resolution way to pinpoint a spot on Earth’s surface. Scientists, surveyors, the military and others often need a very precise GPS location, and all it takes is a more complicated GPS receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-full\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"Graphic of woman with cell phone explains that if her distance from one satellite is known, she could be at many spots.

But about 15 years ago Larson and others began wondering if they could take advantage of the echoes in scientific GPS receivers. She started looking at the frequencies of the signals that reflected off the ground and how those combined with the signals that had arrived directly at the receiver. From that she could deduce qualities of the surface that the echoes had bounced off. “We just reverse-engineered those echoes,” says Larson.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-full\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\\\"Graphic shows GPS antenna on the ground receiving a direct signal and an indirect signal that reflects off the ground.

The goal was to measure whether the river sediments are compacting and the land is slowly sinking — making it more vulnerable to flooding during tropical cyclones and sea level rise. “GPS is an amazing tool to help answer this question and more,” Galetzka says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn a farming community called Sonatala, on the edge of a mangrove forest, Galetzka and his colleagues placed one GPS station on the concrete roof of a primary school.

But you’d probably still be surprised at all the things that GPS — the global positioning system that underlies all of modern navigation — can do.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eGPS consists of a constellation of satellites that send signals to Earth’s surface. A basic GPS receiver, like the one in your smartphone, determines where you are — to within about 1 to 10 meters — by measuring the arrival time of signals from four or more satellites. With fancier (and more expensive) GPS receivers, scientists can pinpoint their locations down to centimeters or even millimeters.

GPS has led to better warning systems for natural disasters such as flash floods and volcanic eruptions. And researchers have even MacGyvered some GPS receivers into acting as snow sensors, tide gauges and other unexpected tools for measuring Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003e“People thought I was crazy when I started talking about these applications,” says Kristine Larson, a geophysicist at the University of Colorado Boulder who has led many of the discoveries and wrote about them in the 2019 \u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences\u003c/em\u003e. “Well, it turned out we were able to do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some surprising things scientists have only recently realized they could do with GPS.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003e1. Feel an earthquake\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eFor centuries geoscientists have relied on seismometers, which measure how much the ground is shaking, to assess how big and how bad an earthquake is. GPS receivers served a different purpose — to track geologic processes that happen on much slower scales, such as the rate at which Earth’s great crustal plates grind past one another in the process known as plate tectonics. So GPS might tell scientists the speed at which the opposite sides of the San Andreas Fault are creeping past each other, while seismometers measure the ground shaking when that California fault ruptures in a quake.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMost researchers thought that GPS simply couldn’t measure locations precisely enough, and quickly enough, to be useful in assessing earthquakes. But it turns out that scientists can squeeze extra information out of the signals that GPS satellites transmit to Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThose signals arrive in two components. One is the unique series of ones and zeros, known as the code, that each GPS satellite transmits. The second is a shorter-wavelength “carrier” signal that transmits the code from the satellite. Because the carrier signal has a shorter wavelength — a mere 20 centimeters — compared with the longer wavelength of the code, which can be tens or hundreds of meters, the carrier signal offers a high-resolution way to pinpoint a spot on Earth’s surface. Scientists, surveyors, the military and others often need a very precise GPS location, and all it takes is a more complicated GPS receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eEngineers have also improved the rate at which GPS receivers update their location, meaning they can refresh themselves as often as 20 times a second or more. Once researchers realized they could take precise measurements so quickly, they started using GPS to examine how the ground moved during an earthquake.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2003, in one of the first studies of its kind, Larson and her colleagues used GPS receivers studded across the western United States \u003ca href=\\\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/300/5624/1421\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eto study how the ground shifted\u003c/a\u003e as seismic waves rippled from a magnitude 7.9 earthquake in Alaska. By 2011, researchers were able to take GPS data on the magnitude 9.1 earthquake that devastated Japan and show that the seafloor \u003ca href=\\\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011GL048700\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ehad shifted a staggering 60 meters\u003c/a\u003e during the quake.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eToday, scientists are looking more broadly at how GPS data can help them quickly assess earthquakes. Diego Melgar of the University of Oregon in Eugene and Gavin Hayes of the US Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado, retrospectively studied 12 large earthquakes to see \u003ca href=\\\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/5/eaav2032\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eif they could tell, within seconds of the quake beginning\u003c/a\u003e, just how large it would get. By including information from GPS stations near the quakes’ epicenters, the scientists could determine within 10 seconds whether the quake would be a damaging magnitude 7 or a completely destructive magnitude 9.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers along the US West Coast have even been incorporating GPS into their fledgling earthquake early warning system, which detects ground shaking and notifies people in distant cities whether shaking is likely to hit them soon. And \u003ca href=\\\"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article-abstract/89/4/1546/530337/the-chilean-gnss-network-current-status-and\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eChile has been building out its GPS network\u003c/a\u003e in order to have more accurate information more quickly, which can help calculate whether a quake near the coast is likely to generate a tsunami or not.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003e2. Monitor a volcano\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond earthquakes, the speed of GPS is helping officials respond more quickly to other natural disasters as they unfold.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMany volcano observatories, for example, have GPS receivers arrayed around the mountains they monitor, because when magma begins shifting underground that often causes the surface to shift as well. By monitoring how GPS stations around a volcano rise or sink over time, researchers can get a better idea about where molten rock is flowing.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBefore last year’s big eruption of the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii, researchers used GPS \u003ca href=\\\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6425/367\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eto understand which parts of the volcano were shifting most rapidly\u003c/a\u003e. Officials used that information to help decide which areas to evacuate residents from.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eGPS data can also be useful even after a volcano has erupted. Because the signals travel from satellites to the ground, they have to pass through whatever material the volcano is ejecting into the air. In 2013, several research groups studied GPS data from an eruption of the Redoubt volcano in Alaska four years earlier and found that the signals became distorted soon after the eruption began.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eBy studying the distortions, the scientists could estimate how much ash had spewed out and how fast it was traveling. In an ensuing paper, Larson called it “\u003ca href=\\\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/grl.50556\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ea new way to detect volcanic plumes\u003c/a\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eShe and her colleagues have been \u003ca href=\\\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JTECH-D-18-0177.1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eworking on ways to do this\u003c/a\u003e with smartphone-variety GPS receivers rather than expensive scientific receivers. That could enable volcanologists to set up a relatively inexpensive GPS network and monitor ash plumes as they rise. Volcanic plumes are a big problem for airplanes, which have to fly around the ash rather than risk the particles’ clogging up their jet engines.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003e3. Probe the snow\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the most unexpected uses of GPS come from the messiest parts of its signal — the parts that bounce off the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eA typical GPS receiver, like the one in your smartphone, mostly picks up signals that are coming directly from GPS satellites overhead. But it also picks up signals that have bounced on the ground you’re walking on and reflected up to your smartphone.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eFor many years scientists had thought these reflected signals were nothing but noise, a sort of echo that muddied the data and made it hard to figure out what was going on. But about 15 years ago Larson and others began wondering if they could take advantage of the echoes in scientific GPS receivers. She started looking at the frequencies of the signals that reflected off the ground and how those combined with the signals that had arrived directly at the receiver. From that she could deduce qualities of the surface that the echoes had bounced off. “We just reverse-engineered those echoes,” says Larson.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThis approach allows scientists to learn about the ground beneath the GPS receiver — for instance how much moisture the soil contains or how much snow has accumulated on the surface. (The more snow falls on the ground, the shorter the distance between the echo and the receiver.) GPS stations can work as snow sensors to measure snow depth, such as in mountain areas where snowpack is a major water resource each year.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThe technique also works well in the Arctic and Antarctica, where there are few weather stations monitoring snowfall year-round. Matt Siegfried, now at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, and his colleagues studied \u003ca href=\\\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GL074039\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003esnow accumulation at 23 GPS stations in West Antarctica\u003c/a\u003e from 2007 to 2017. They found they could directly measure the changing snow. That’s crucial information for researchers looking to assess how much snow the Antarctic ice sheet builds up each winter — and how that compares with what melts away each summer.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003e4. Sense a sinking\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eGPS may have started off as a way to measure location on solid ground, but it turns out to be also useful in monitoring changes in water levels.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn July, John Galetzka, an engineer at the UNAVCO geophysics research organization in Boulder, Colorado, found himself installing GPS stations in Bangladesh, at the junction of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers. The goal was to measure whether the river sediments are compacting and the land is slowly sinking — making it more vulnerable to flooding during tropical cyclones and sea level rise. “GPS is an amazing tool to help answer this question and more,” Galetzka says.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eIn a farming community called Sonatala, on the edge of a mangrove forest, Galetzka and his colleagues placed one GPS station on the concrete roof of a primary school. They set up a second station nearby, atop a rod hammered into a rice paddy. If the ground really is sinking, then the second GPS station will look as if it is slowly emerging from the ground. And by measuring the GPS echoes beneath the stations, the scientists can measure factors such as how much water is standing in the rice paddy during the rainy season.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eGPS receivers can even help oceanographers and mariners, by acting as tide gauges. Larson stumbled onto this \u003ca href=\\\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140013285.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ewhile working with GPS data from Kachemak Bay, Alaska\u003c/a\u003e. The station was established to study tectonic deformation, but Larson was curious because the bay also has some of the biggest tidal variations in the United States. She looked at the GPS signals that were bouncing off the water and up to the receiver, and was able to track tidal changes almost as accurately as a real tide gauge in a nearby harbor.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eThis could be helpful in parts of the world that don’t have long-term tide gauges set up — but do happen to have a GPS station nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch2\u003e5. Analyze the atmosphere\u003c/h2\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, GPS can tease out information about the sky overhead, in ways that scientists hadn’t thought possible until just a few years ago. Water vapor, electrically charged particles, and other factors can delay GPS signals traveling through the atmosphere, and that allows researchers to make new discoveries.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eOne group of scientists uses GPS to study the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere that is available to precipitate out as rain or snow. Researchers have used these changes to calculate how much water is likely to fall from the sky in drenching downpours, allowing forecasters to \u003ca href=\\\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/BAMS-D-14-00095.1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003efine-tune their predictions of flash floods\u003c/a\u003e in places like Southern California. During a July 2013 storm, meteorologists used GPS data to track monsoonal moisture moving onshore there, which turned out to be crucial information for issuing a warning 17 minutes before flash floods hit.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eGPS signals are also affected when they travel through the electrically charged part of the upper atmosphere, known as the ionosphere. Scientists have used GPS data \u003ca href=\\\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JA024654\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eto track changes in the ionosphere\u003c/a\u003e as tsunamis race across the ocean below. (The force of the tsunami produces changes in the atmosphere that ripple all the way up to the ionosphere.) This technique could one day complement the traditional method of tsunami warning, which uses buoys dotted across the ocean to measure the height of the traveling wave.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd scientists have even been able to study the effects of a total solar eclipse using GPS. In August 2017, they used GPS stations across the United States to measure \u003ca href=\\\"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/214/1/651/4970768\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ehow the number of electrons in the upper atmosphere dropped\u003c/a\u003e as the moon’s shadow moved across the continent, dimming the light that otherwise created electrons.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eSo GPS is useful for everything from ground shaking beneath your feet to snow falling from the sky.

The idea was that you have different cells in your body. Similarly, you could have robots that could come together and have a whole organism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you are not among that particular community, modular reconfigurable robots can be a little bit broader. In the \u003cem\u003eAnnual Reviews\u003c/em\u003e article, we talked about a typical standard milling machine where we have different types of tools that go into it. It’s modular in the sense that these tools can be swapped out, but they’re not identical. It’s a very different type of thing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would the goal of a modular reconfigurable robotic system be? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’ve actually hit on one of the important, yet difficult issues with modular reconfigurable robots. One of the characteristics is that they reconfigure into different shapes. They can do lots and lots of different things. Usually that means that they don’t do most of them very well, at least not optimally. So the types of situations in which they work the best are those that require lots of different uses. The examples we’ve given in the past are things like planetary exploration. If you want to send something to Mars, you don’t know what you will find there, so a robot that can do lots of different things will be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA near-term thing that most robotics researchers always talk about is search and rescue. You’ve got a building that’s fallen. You don’t know if you’ll need a wheeled robot or a legged robot. You don’t know if you need something small enough to go through tight spaces or under rubble, or big enough to move that rubble, or tall enough to look over a wall to see if something’s on the other side. You don’t know if you need to lift up objects. So having a system that can adapt, rearrange itself and change its functionality for the situation would be one in which modular reconfigurable robots would excel. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you describe some of the main types of modular robots?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe the most popular type among the reconfigurable robotics research community is what we call the lattice configuration. This is a little bit more like LEGO bricks. The modules form a lattice as you put them together. The reason why they may be most popular is because they are a bit easier to program. It’s easier to think about how you get them to rearrange.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-video -full-width\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003cdiv class=\\\"video-container\\\"\u003e\\n        \u003ciframe allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/25zKLyOCA3A\\\" width=\\\"560\\\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\\n      \u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n      \u003cdiv class=\\\"article-video-caption\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n          \\n    \u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eA video displaying the ModQuad, a group of drones that can self-assemble from individual units into a number of larger shapes.

So instead of taking a video of a person and transmitting it somewhere, you could take a 3D capture of that person and use lattice-style robots to translate it into a remote 3D system that would move as the person moves. Of course, that’s really hard, and we’re not that close to making that system. Part of the reason it would just be used for 3D representation is because we don’t know how well that system could work in an environment. Could it move objects? Maybe not. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s another kind, which we call a chain-style reconfigurable robot. They form shapes more like standard robot arms and industrial arms. That one is better for doing typical robot tasks and assembly. The modules tend to need to be larger — usually you can’t have millions of modules; you have 10, 20 or 30. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does it take to make something self-reconfigurable, rather than something that has to be reconfigured by hand?  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe dividing line is not that crisp, actually. Having something reconfigure itself requires basically a docking mechanism that you can actuate, and you can get two parts to attach and detach automatically. There are a variety of things like that around now. Like refueling on jet fighters: They have this thing where a fighter jet flies up behind a tanker with a trailing refueling tube and docks with the end of the tube. That’s a very simple, one-element docking, and it’s definitely self-reconfiguring. But is it a modular reconfigurable robot? Not quite as we think of it. In our research, you need more than a handful of modules, all of which can attach, detach and rearrange themselves. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you make a good docking system? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s really tricky. With magnets, you can get strong attachments, but sometimes it’s hard to make them detach. There’s also glue, you can weld things or you can have screws — there’s lots of different ways to get things to attach, but getting them to detach is an interesting problem. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, the classic mechanical engineering style is to have hooks or latches that grab onto things and release. One of the issues that we’ve had with this is that those systems can be large: Over 50 percent of the volume of a particular module might be the latching and docking mechanism. So a good portion of that robot is not useful for the task that it’s doing, because it’s made for the reconfiguration part. So that’s another way in which things aren’t necessarily the most efficient. But those things can be very strong and release with zero force.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-video -full-width\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003cdiv class=\\\"video-container\\\"\u003e\\n        \u003ciframe allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YWtoLZupjsc\\\" width=\\\"560\\\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\\n      \u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n      \u003cdiv class=\\\"article-video-caption\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n          \\n    \u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe SMORES-EP module is a versatile, autonomous modular robot able to take stock of its environment and then reconfigure its shape so it can navigate the space.

Often what will happen is you have something that’s not terribly strong as a glue; it’s kind of like an adhesive. And then when it releases, it’s not completely releasing either. It’s still kind of tacky. The ratio of bonding strength to releasing forces is not great, but it takes very, very little space. Depending on the mechanism for actuating it, you could release the bond with electricity, heat or sometimes light.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne group also came up with melting a low-temperature alloy, which can be very strong and doesn’t take a huge amount of space.

But the roster of real-world robots is considerably more varied. The list includes Boston Dynamics’ dog-inspired robots, Dalek-like security bots, industrial arms on an assembly line and any number of flying insect-inspired robots. If a machine is designed to do a complicated task in an automated fashion, it’s a robot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA robot, it turns out, doesn’t even need to have a fixed shape. That’s the vision of researchers who work in modular reconfigurable robotics and are pursuing bots that can assemble themselves, by rearranging similar or identical parts into whatever shape suits the task at hand. These robots can take the form of snakes, lattices, trusses and more, and can be set to any challenge — providing construction support, doing repair work or scouring for survivors after a natural disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOr rather, they will hopefully do all that some day. In May 2019, the \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-control-053018-023834\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnnual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e surveyed both the promise of modular reconfigurable robots (MRR), and the many barriers that remain before they can become a reality. To get a sense of where these reconfigurable robots are right now, and where they could be in the future \u003cem\u003e, Knowable Magazine \u003c/em\u003espoke with University of Pennsylvania roboticist Mark Yim, one of the coauthors of the report and director of Penn’s General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) Laboratory. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are modular reconfigurable robots? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLEGO is one analogy that people often use. LEGO bricks are modular and can be rearranged in lots of different ways, so that would be kind of like the modular reconfigurable robots, except these would be LEGO bricks that can rearrange themselves. Very often there will be one type of module, with hundreds of identical units; the reconfiguring of those modules is a big part of the research.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother analogy comes from the \u003ca href=\\\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00437320\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003every first modular robotics paper\u003c/a\u003e in 1988, when Toshio Fukuda and his colleagues in Japan had this idea called  \u003ca href=\\\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/126059\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eCEBOTS\u003c/a\u003e, or cellular robotic systems. The idea was that you have different cells in your body. Similarly, you could have robots that could come together and have a whole organism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you are not among that particular community, modular reconfigurable robots can be a little bit broader. In the \u003cem\u003eAnnual Reviews\u003c/em\u003e article, we talked about a typical standard milling machine where we have different types of tools that go into it. It’s modular in the sense that these tools can be swapped out, but they’re not identical. It’s a very different type of thing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would the goal of a modular reconfigurable robotic system be? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’ve actually hit on one of the important, yet difficult issues with modular reconfigurable robots. One of the characteristics is that they reconfigure into different shapes. They can do lots and lots of different things. Usually that means that they don’t do most of them very well, at least not optimally. So the types of situations in which they work the best are those that require lots of different uses. The examples we’ve given in the past are things like planetary exploration. If you want to send something to Mars, you don’t know what you will find there, so a robot that can do lots of different things will be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA near-term thing that most robotics researchers always talk about is search and rescue. You’ve got a building that’s fallen. You don’t know if you’ll need a wheeled robot or a legged robot. You don’t know if you need something small enough to go through tight spaces or under rubble, or big enough to move that rubble, or tall enough to look over a wall to see if something’s on the other side. You don’t know if you need to lift up objects. So having a system that can adapt, rearrange itself and change its functionality for the situation would be one in which modular reconfigurable robots would excel. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you describe some of the main types of modular robots?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe the most popular type among the reconfigurable robotics research community is what we call the lattice configuration. This is a little bit more like LEGO bricks. The modules form a lattice as you put them together. The reason why they may be most popular is because they are a bit easier to program. It’s easier to think about how you get them to rearrange.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was a Carnegie Mellon group that came up with an application they called “\u003ca href=\\\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~claytronics/talks/ic-ri-2004.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003etelepario\u003c/a\u003e.” If television is a visual medium, telepario was the idea of making a system that could make a physical shape that you could change. So instead of taking a video of a person and transmitting it somewhere, you could take a 3D capture of that person and use lattice-style robots to translate it into a remote 3D system that would move as the person moves. Of course, that’s really hard, and we’re not that close to making that system. Part of the reason it would just be used for 3D representation is because we don’t know how well that system could work in an environment. Could it move objects? Maybe not. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s another kind, which we call a chain-style reconfigurable robot. They form shapes more like standard robot arms and industrial arms. That one is better for doing typical robot tasks and assembly. The modules tend to need to be larger — usually you can’t have millions of modules; you have 10, 20 or 30. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does it take to make something self-reconfigurable, rather than something that has to be reconfigured by hand?  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe dividing line is not that crisp, actually. Having something reconfigure itself requires basically a docking mechanism that you can actuate, and you can get two parts to attach and detach automatically. There are a variety of things like that around now. Like refueling on jet fighters: They have this thing where a fighter jet flies up behind a tanker with a trailing refueling tube and docks with the end of the tube. That’s a very simple, one-element docking, and it’s definitely self-reconfiguring. But is it a modular reconfigurable robot? Not quite as we think of it. In our research, you need more than a handful of modules, all of which can attach, detach and rearrange themselves. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you make a good docking system? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s really tricky. With magnets, you can get strong attachments, but sometimes it’s hard to make them detach. There’s also glue, you can weld things or you can have screws — there’s lots of different ways to get things to attach, but getting them to detach is an interesting problem. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, the classic mechanical engineering style is to have hooks or latches that grab onto things and release. One of the issues that we’ve had with this is that those systems can be large: Over 50 percent of the volume of a particular module might be the latching and docking mechanism. So a good portion of that robot is not useful for the task that it’s doing, because it’s made for the reconfiguration part. So that’s another way in which things aren’t necessarily the most efficient. But those things can be very strong and release with zero force.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are people trying to come up with something like a \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/06/11/1818534116\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eswitchable glue\u003c/a\u003e. Often what will happen is you have something that’s not terribly strong as a glue; it’s kind of like an adhesive. And then when it releases, it’s not completely releasing either. It’s still kind of tacky. The ratio of bonding strength to releasing forces is not great, but it takes very, very little space. Depending on the mechanism for actuating it, you could release the bond with electricity, heat or sometimes light.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne group also came up with melting a low-temperature alloy, which can be very strong and doesn’t take a huge amount of space. But detaching it means melting it and that does take a lot of energy. And there’s some question about how many times you can repeat that before it starts to fail. So you may run into robustness issues. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA lot of people dream about making tiny, tiny modules. Science fiction movies often come into play. People think about the \u003cem\u003eTerminator\u003c/em\u003e movies with a liquid metal robot — molecule-sized modules turn into a Terminator. People are trying to make the module as small as possible, but reaching that small of a size is still far in the future. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat areas of technological development are helping to bring these modular robotic systems into a real-world setting? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe thing that I think is exciting is the truss reconfiguration systems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrusses are naturally modular. Making them reconfigurable basically gets past the constraint of having modular systems that are small, weak and require millions of moving parts, which just makes things very difficult from a practical point of view.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe variable topology truss project we’ve been working on doesn’t have to be field-ready or so strong that it can shore up buildings.

He came up with the idea that language is so complex, and children learn it so rapidly, that children must have innate knowledge about language. That’s an elegant solution to the problem, I suppose, but it’s probably not true.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that’s because it’s hard to imagine how a child could have innate knowledge that would apply to all languages, right? That’s a point you make in the review — that any child from anywhere in the world can learn any language.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExactly. Chomsky called this the Universal Grammar hypothesis: Children are born with what’s common to all languages across the world. But once you start looking, you start questioning whether there’s a lot that \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e common to all languages. And so the Universal Grammar hypothesis becomes hollow, because then you’re simply saying things like languages use little bits of sound to create syllables to create words. You’re not coming up with profound conclusions about what could be innate to all languages — such as children having innate knowledge of nouns, verbs and adjectives and how those combine to form sentences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt sounds like you’re arguing that a child’s environment is a more important factor. What’s your view of the role of nature versus nurture in language acquisition?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think there have to be innate processes that are involved, but I think \u003cem\u003eprocesses\u003c/em\u003e is the key there. We’re born with what I like to think of as a cognitive tool kit.

In the life sciences, one pervasive example is the heat map, which is often used to reveal relationships between two sets of data. “If you flip through a journal, a third of the figures are heat maps,” he says. “This is a very popular form of data visualization that in fact is biasing scientific data.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA heat map is a two-dimensional matrix, basically a table or grid, that uses color for each square in the grid to represent the values of the underlying data. Lighter and darker shades of one or more hues indicate lower or higher values. Heat maps are especially popular for displaying data on gene activity, helping researchers identify patterns of genes that are more or less actively producing proteins (or other molecules) in different situations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image -caption-center\\\" xml:space=\\\"preserve\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"article-image-container\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg alt=\\\"A close-up of a heat map shows the simultaneous contrast illusion in action: Starred squares are identical, but one looks much lighter than the other due to the relative darkness of the neighboring squares.\\\" src=\\\"/sites/default/files/articles/371/G-10-clustering_4.svg\\\" title=\\\"Identical values\\\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n        \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"caption\\\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe two starred squares on this heat map are identical shades of orange, indicating identical values in terms of gene activity.

But putting various shades of colors right next to each other can trigger the simultaneous contrast illusion. For example, a scientist comparing the colors of individual squares in the grid can easily misinterpret two different shades of orange as being the same — or think that two identical shades are quite different — depending on the colors of the surrounding squares.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“This is a huge problem in heat maps where you’re relying on a bunch of color tiles sitting next to each other,” Wong says. “This unintentional bias is sort of rampant in every heat map.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor gene activity data, green and red are often used to show which genes are more or less active. A particular shade of green can look very different surrounded by lighter shades of green compared with when it is surrounded by darker shades of green, or by red or black.

Breaking up the squares will reduce the interference from neighboring colors. Another solution is to use an entirely different display, such as a graph that uses lines to connect highly active genes, or a \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"http://www.cs.utah.edu/~miriah/publications/pathline.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eseries of graphs that represent change\u003c/a\u003e in gene activity over time or between two experimental states.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMuddled messaging\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaking sure a visualization won’t mispresent data or mislead readers is essential in sharing scientific results.

For the viewer, “that’s often overwhelmed by this big old thing in the middle.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe solution could be to use something other than height to represent the distribution of the data. One option is a bar code plot, which displays each value as a line.

A good example is the ever-popular pie chart, which has earned the disdain of data visualization experts like Edward Tufte. In his influential 1983 treatise, \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, Tufte wrote that “the only design worse than a pie chart is several of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePie charts are often used to compare parts of a whole, a cognitively challenging visual task.

If the goal is to show that the parts add up to a whole, or to compare the parts with that whole (rather than comparing slices with each other), a well-executed pie chart might suffice as long as precision isn’t crucial.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, a pie chart that depicts how much each economic sector contributes to greenhouse gas emissions nicely shows that around half come from electricity and heat production along with agriculture, forestry and other land use. Transportation, which often gets the most attention, makes up a much smaller piece of the pie. Putting six bars next to each other in this case doesn’t immediately show that the parts add up to 100 percent or what proportion of the whole each bar represents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn some scientific disciplines, the pie chart is simply standard practice for displaying specific types of data. And it’s hard to buck tradition. “There are certain areas in epigenetics where we have to show the pie chart,” says Wong, who works with biomedical scientists at the Broad Institute to create better visualizations. “I know the shortcomings of a pie chart, but it’s always been shown as a pie chart in every publication, so people hold on to that very tight.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn other instances, the extra work pies ask of the human brain makes them poor vehicles for delivering accurate information or a coherent story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBehind bars\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough bar graphs are easy to read and understand, that doesn’t mean they’re always the best choice. In some fields, such as psychology, medicine and physiology, bar graphs can often misrepresent the underlying data and mask important details.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Bar graphs are something that you should use if you are visualizing counts or proportions,” says Tracey Weissgerber, a physiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who studies how research is done and reported. “But they’re not a very effective strategy for visualizing \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/discrete-vs-continuous-variables/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003econtinuous data\u003c/a\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWeissgerber conducted a survey of top physiology journals in 2015 and found that some \u003ca href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003e85 percent of papers contained at least one bar graph\u003c/a\u003e representing continuous data — things like measurements of blood pressure or temperature where each sample can have any value within the relevant range. But bars representing continuous data can fail to show some significant information, such as how many samples are represented by each bar and whether there are subgroups within a bar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, Weissgerber notes that the pregnancy complication preeclampsia can stem from problems with the mother or from problems with the baby or placenta. But within those groups are subgroups of patients who arrive at the same symptoms through different pathways. “We’re really focused on trying to understand and identify women with different subtypes of preeclampsia,” Weissgerber says. “And one of the problems with that is if we’re presenting all of our data in a bar graph, there are no subgroups in a bar graph.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBar charts are especially problematic for studies with small sample sizes, which are common in the basic biomedical sciences. Bars don’t show how small the  sample sizes are, and outliers can have a big effect on the mean indicated by the height of a bar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“One of the challenges is that in many areas of the basic biomedical sciences, bar graphs are just accepted as ... how we show continuous data,” Weissgerber says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are several good alternative graphs for small continuous data sets. Scatterplots, box plots and histograms all reveal the distribution of the data, but they were rarely used in the papers Weissgerber analyzed.

Human perception of color isn’t straightforward, and most scientists don’t take the peculiarities of the visual system into account when choosing colors to represent their data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most common bad practices is using the rainbow color scale.

Is yellow larger than red?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn even bigger problem is that the rainbow is perceived unevenly by the human brain. People see color in terms of hue (such as red or blue), saturation (intensity of the color), and lightness (how much white or black is mixed in). Human brains rely most heavily on lightness to interpret shapes and depth and therefore tend to see the brightest colors as representing peaks and darker colors as valleys. But the brightest color in the rainbow is yellow, which is usually found somewhere in the middle of the scale, leading viewers to see high points in the wrong places.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCompounding the problem, the transitions between some colors appear gradual, while other changes seem much more abrupt. The underlying data, on the other hand, usually have a consistent rate of change that doesn’t match the perceived unevenness of the rainbow. “You can have perceptual boundaries where none exist and also hide boundaries that do exist,” says climate scientist Ed Hawkins of the University of Reading in England. \u003ca href=\\\"http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2016/why-rainbow-colour-scales-can-be-misleading/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eEven scientists can fall prey to this illusion\u003c/a\u003e when interpreting their own data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo avoid the rainbow problem, some researchers have come up with mathematically based palettes that better match the perceptual change in their colors to changes in the corresponding data. Some of these newer color scales work specifically for people with red-green color blindness, which is estimated to affect around 8 percent of men (but only a tiny fraction of women).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough \u003ca href=\\\"http://cartonerd.blogspot.com/2017/08/too-much-rain-for-rainbow.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003ecartographers\u003c/a\u003e and a few scientists like Hawkins have been \u003ca href=\\\"http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2014/end-of-the-rainbow/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003erailing against the rainbow\u003c/a\u003e for decades, it remains pervasive in the scientific literature.

A well-known illustration of this, the \u003ca href=\\\"http://persci.mit.edu/gallery/checkershadow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003echecker shadow illusion\u003c/a\u003e, plays with the brain’s interpretation of colors when a shadow is cast across a checkered grid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The effect of color interactions poses a huge problem,” Wong says. In the life sciences, one pervasive example is the heat map, which is often used to reveal relationships between two sets of data. “If you flip through a journal, a third of the figures are heat maps,” he says. “This is a very popular form of data visualization that in fact is biasing scientific data.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA heat map is a two-dimensional matrix, basically a table or grid, that uses color for each square in the grid to represent the values of the underlying data. Lighter and darker shades of one or more hues indicate lower or higher values. Heat maps are especially popular for displaying data on gene activity, helping researchers identify patterns of genes that are more or less actively producing proteins (or other molecules) in different situations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHeat maps are great for packing a ton of data into a compact display. But putting various shades of colors right next to each other can trigger the simultaneous contrast illusion. For example, a scientist comparing the colors of individual squares in the grid can easily misinterpret two different shades of orange as being the same — or think that two identical shades are quite different — depending on the colors of the surrounding squares.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“This is a huge problem in heat maps where you’re relying on a bunch of color tiles sitting next to each other,” Wong says. “This unintentional bias is sort of rampant in every heat map.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor gene activity data, green and red are often used to show which genes are more or less active. A particular shade of green can look very different surrounded by lighter shades of green compared with when it is surrounded by darker shades of green, or by red or black. The value that the shade of green is representing is the same, but it will appear higher or lower depending on its neighboring squares.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA blob of bright green squares in one part of the grid might mean that a gene is highly active in a group of closely related subspecies, say of bacteria. At the same time in another part of the grid, a single dull-green square surrounded by black squares may look bright, making it appear that the same gene is highly active in an unrelated bacterium species, when in fact it is only weakly active.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne way to mitigate the problem, Wong says, is to introduce some white space between parts of the grid, perhaps to separate groups of related species, groups of samples or sets of related genes. Breaking up the squares will reduce the interference from neighboring colors. Another solution is to use an entirely different display, such as a graph that uses lines to connect highly active genes, or a \u003ca href=\\\"http://www.cs.utah.edu/~miriah/publications/pathline.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eseries of graphs that represent change\u003c/a\u003e in gene activity over time or between two experimental states.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMuddled messaging\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaking sure a visualization won’t mispresent data or mislead readers is essential in sharing scientific results. But it’s also important to consider whether a figure is truly drawing attention to the most relevant information and not distracting readers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, the distribution of many data sets when plotted as a line graph or a histogram will have a bell shape with the bulk of the data near the center. “But often we care about what’s on the tails,” Wong says. For the viewer, “that’s often overwhelmed by this big old thing in the middle.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe solution could be to use something other than height to represent the distribution of the data. One option is a bar code plot, which displays each value as a line. On this type of graph, it is easier to see details in areas of low concentration that tend to all but disappear on a bell curve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThoughtfully applied color can also enhance and clarify a graphic’s message. On a scatterplot that uses different colors to identify categories of data, for instance, the most important information should be represented by the colors that stand out most. Graphing programs may just randomly assign red to the control group because it’s the first column of data, while the interesting mutant that is central to the findings ends up colored gray.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Pure colors are uncommon in nature, so limit them to highlight whatever is important in your graphics,” writes data visualization journalist Alberto Cairo in his 2013 book \u003cem\u003eThe Functional Art\u003c/em\u003e. “Use subdued hues — grays, light blues, and greens — for everything else.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBesides the rainbow and simultaneous contrast, there are plenty of other ways to get into trouble with color. Using too many colors can distract from a visualization’s main message. Colors that are too similar to each other or to the background color of an image can be hard to decipher.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eColors that go \u003ca href=\\\"http://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2013-SemanticColor-EuroVis.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eagainst cultural expectations\u003c/a\u003e can also affect how well a reader can understand a figure. On maps that show terrain, for example, the expectation is that vegetation is green, dry areas are brown, higher elevations are white, cities are gray, and of course water is blue. A map that doesn’t observe these well-established color schemes would be much harder to read. Imagine a US electoral map with \u003ca href=\\\"https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gmd:gmd370m:g3701m:g3701gm:gct00009:ca000039/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eDemocratic areas shown in red and Republican areas in blue\u003c/a\u003e, or a bar chart showing different causes of death in bright, cheery colors — the dissonance would make it harder to absorb their message.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf color isn’t necessary, sometimes it’s safest to stick with shades of gray. As Tufte put it in his 1990 book \u003cem\u003eEnvisioning Information\u003c/em\u003e, “Avoiding catastrophe becomes the first principle in bringing color to information: \u003cem\u003eAbove all, do no harm\u003c/em\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eVisualize the future\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany data visualization problems persist because scientists simply aren’t aware of them or aren’t convinced that better figures are worth the extra effort, O’Donoghue says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe’s been working to change this situation by initiating and chairing the annual \u003ca href=\\\"http://vizbi.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eVizbi conference\u003c/a\u003e focused on visualizing biological science, teaching a visualization workshop for scientists, and combing the literature for evidence of the best and worst practices, which are compiled into his 2018 Annual Reviews paper. But overall, he says, the effort hasn’t gained a lot of momentum yet. “I think we’ve got a long ways to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne reason for the lack of awareness is that most scientists don’t get any training in data visualization. It’s rarely required of science graduate students, and most institutions don’t offer classes designed on scientific visualization. For many students, particularly in the biomedical sciences, their only exposure to data visualization is in \u003ca href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002430\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003estatistics courses that aren’t tailored to their needs\u003c/a\u003e, Weissgerber says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScientists also tend to follow convention when it comes to how they display data, which perpetuates bad practices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne way to combat the power of precedent is by incorporating better design principles into the tools scientists use to plot their data (such as the software tools that have already switched from the rainbow default to more perceptually even palettes). Most scientists aren’t going to learn better visualization practices, O’Donoghue says, “but they’re going to use tools. And if those tools have better principles in them, then just by default they will [apply those].”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScientific publishers could also help, he says. “I think the journals can play a role by setting standards.” Early-career scientists take their cues from more experienced colleagues and from published papers. Some journals, including \u003cem\u003ePLoS Biology\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eELife\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eNature Biomedical Engineering\u003c/em\u003e have already responded to Weissgerber’s 2015 work on bar graphs. “In the time since the paper was published, a number of journals have changed their policies to ban or discourage the use of bar graphs for continuous data, particularly for small data sets,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith scientific data becoming increasingly complex, scientists will need to continue developing new kinds of visualizations to handle that complexity. To make those visualizations effective — for both scientists and the general public — data visualization designers will have to apply the best research on humans’ visual processing in order to work with the brain, rather than against it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEditor’s note: A graphic on the “Chart challenge” slide show was corrected on November 14, 2019.

That’s a record, and given that these phenomena often result in family separations and that more than half of these individuals were children under the age of 18, it suggests that historic numbers of children have been separated from their parents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\\\"promo -left\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"header\\\"\u003eYou May Also Like\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n      \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n              \u003cdiv class=\\\"eyebrow\\\"\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/term/mind\\\" hreflang=\\\"en\\\"\u003eThe Mind\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch3\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/article/mind/2018/how-second-language-can-boost-brain\\\"\u003eHow a second language can boost the brain\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/h3\u003e\\n\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n              \u003cdiv class=\\\"eyebrow\\\"\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/term/society\\\" hreflang=\\\"en\\\"\u003eSociety\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch3\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/article/society/2019/kids-middle\\\"\u003eKids in the middle\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/h3\u003e\\n\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n              \u003cdiv class=\\\"eyebrow\\\"\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/term/mind\\\" hreflang=\\\"en\\\"\u003eThe Mind\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch3\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/article/mind/2019/mental-health-mother-and-baby\\\"\u003eHow maternal mood shapes the developing brain\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/h3\u003e\\n\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n        \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item\\\"\u003e\\n            \u003cdiv class=\\\"promo-item-text\\\"\u003e\\n              \u003cdiv class=\\\"eyebrow\\\"\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/term/society\\\" hreflang=\\\"en\\\"\u003eSociety\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n\\n\u003ch3\u003e\\n  \u003ca href=\\\"/article/society/2018/immigration-isnt-linked-higher-crime-rates-not-everyone-can-believe-it\\\"\u003eImmigration isn’t linked to higher crime rates — but not everyone can believe it\u003c/a\u003e\\n\u003c/h3\u003e\\n\\n\u003c/div\u003e\\n        \u003c/div\u003e\\n        \\n\\n      \\n    \u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy have such family separations become more common? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany factors are driving it, but \u003ca class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/sustainability/2017/climate-change-can-set-stage-violence\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\u003eclimate change is playing an increasing role in displacement and armed conflict all over the world\u003c/a\u003e.

In 1943, Anna Freud and Dorothy Burlingame studied children who’d been evacuated from London and learned that in many cases being separated from their mothers was more traumatic for them than having been exposed to air raids. When families left London but stayed together, the children behaved more or less normally.

In 2018, some 70.8 million individuals were forcibly displaced due to armed conflicts, wars and disasters.

We’re talking about cognitive, social-emotional and other mental health impacts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe developmental study of the mechanisms that may explain why these separations are so harmful goes back to before World War II, with the work of psychoanalysts and scholars such as Anna Freud, John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth. In 1943, Anna Freud and Dorothy Burlingame studied children who’d been evacuated from London and learned that in many cases being separated from their mothers was more traumatic for them than having been exposed to air raids. When families left London but stayed together, the children behaved more or less normally. But when children were separated from their mothers, they showed signs of severe trauma, such as wetting the bed and crying for long periods of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater on, \u003ca href=\\\"http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/attachment/online/inge_origins.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eBowlby and Ainsworth\u003c/a\u003e published their more well-known studies of how infants form attachments with their mothers, and how sensitive and responsive parenting is key to forming secure attachments both with parents and later on with others.

Permanent loss of parents can create some of the most severe consequences, while long periods of parent-child separation, even if followed by reunification, can seriously disrupt a child’s emotional health. Children are generally more vulnerable to long-term harm to their social-emotional development in early childhood, up to five or six years, but no period of development is immune. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne major problem we see is that most children who are separated from their parents have already experienced some other trauma along the way, which then makes the separation even harder. When parents are present, they can often help buffer the impact of extreme adversity from bad experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat did you learn that most surprised you as you reviewed the scientific literature?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe sheer range of outcomes was surprising to me — beyond learning and achievement and mental health outcomes, they include very basic human functions like impaired memory, auditory processing and planning. They also include a range of physiological outcomes related to stress that are themselves related to long-term disease and mortality. So parent-child separation as it is currently experienced can shorten lives and increase the chances of physical disease.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, something that didn’t surprise me because I’m immersed in this literature all the time, but will probably surprise your readers, is that there are now about 8 million children in the world living in institutional care. This is a problem that reflects the lack of robust foster care and capacity of governments to facilitate placement with relatives, who will generally give more stable care than strangers. As we state in our review, even in otherwise good-quality institutional care, children suffer due to the high turnover of caregivers.   \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat relevance does your work have for US policies that have led to many parents and children being separated at the border? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUS officials should know that there’s a global consensus, expressed in the UN Convention on the Rights of Children, on how to respond to children’s needs in this context. Primarily that means avoiding separating children from parents whenever possible and, when it must happen, keeping it as short as possible. An overwhelming amount of research, going back to Bowlby, supports these guidelines. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, we don’t have a lot of research findings on children separated from their parents while awaiting detention.

While the separations at the Mexican border have gotten a lot of media attention, millions of other children across our country are affected by the relatively recent harsher, sweeping policies resulting in more detentions and deportations of immigrants already living in the US. This has created a climate in which the threat of family separation is omnipresent. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re particularly concerned that many children separated from their parents stop going to school, perhaps from lack of supervision or from the need to support themselves or family members.

After that, it’s a matter of limiting the time away from parents or other caring adults as much as possible. The earlier and younger that children leave institutional care for stable foster care or adoption, the better it is for them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can see this in some of the follow-ups of the study of children in Romanian orphanages. Children who left the orphanages for foster care by 15 months of age had trouble speaking and understanding in early childhood, but not later. Children placed before 30 months showed growth in learning and memory so as to be indistinguishable from other children by age 16. So recovery from early institutionalization is possible, but it may take longer if a child spent more time in the orphanage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kinds of programs for children, if any, can help lessen the impacts of being separated from their parents?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn general, programs that help equip children for their daily lives can be useful. That includes education in decision-making, problem-solving, communication and stress management. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTeachers and doctors can play a major role, at minimum by identifying children who need mental health services and directing them to programs. The fact is we’ll never have enough mental health providers, so it makes sense to train members of the education and basic health systems that are already in place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the review, we describe a few of these efforts. One that stood out for us took place in two schools in London where children on average aged 12 to 13 had been separated from one or both parents due to war or migration. They came from Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Turkey, Afghanistan and Somalia. Teachers identified children who needed services, and who then spent one hour a week for six weeks with a clinical psychology trainee doing cognitive behavioral therapy.

Scarlett gradually stopped making these errors, but at different rates in different sentences. This suggests that she linked the use of “am” to the specific sentence itself, rather than having a broad command of the use of the verb.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is consistent with a learning-based approach to language acquisition, where children learn grammar in a piecemeal fashion, rather than learning the broad rules (for example, be, is, am, are) and quickly generalizing use across a range of contexts. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe a more common mistake, one that you hear children make a lot, are these overgeneralization errors.

Languages are these incredibly complex systems, yet children master them within their first five years. And even before that, as a 3.5- to 4-year-old, they are pretty good at engaging in conversations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat became a problem for me to try to explain, though it’s not much of a problem if you’re a child — it’s probably a wonderful thing. But learning a language as an adult is incredibly effortful and error-prone, so it seems that children are pretty privileged language learners. And that’s the hook that made me interested in explaining the developmental processes related to language.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are some of the different theories around language acquisition and how have they evolved?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell, the influence of \u003ca href=\\\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstb.1981.0135\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003eNoam Chomsky\u003c/a\u003e really is still all over the field. He came up with the idea that language is so complex, and children learn it so rapidly, that children must have innate knowledge about language. That’s an elegant solution to the problem, I suppose, but it’s probably not true.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that’s because it’s hard to imagine how a child could have innate knowledge that would apply to all languages, right? That’s a point you make in the review — that any child from anywhere in the world can learn any language.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExactly. Chomsky called this the Universal Grammar hypothesis: Children are born with what’s common to all languages across the world. But once you start looking, you start questioning whether there’s a lot that \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e common to all languages. And so the Universal Grammar hypothesis becomes hollow, because then you’re simply saying things like languages use little bits of sound to create syllables to create words. You’re not coming up with profound conclusions about what could be innate to all languages — such as children having innate knowledge of nouns, verbs and adjectives and how those combine to form sentences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt sounds like you’re arguing that a child’s environment is a more important factor. What’s your view of the role of nature versus nurture in language acquisition?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think there have to be innate processes that are involved, but I think \u003cem\u003eprocesses\u003c/em\u003e is the key there. We’re born with what I like to think of as a cognitive tool kit. So very early on, as soon as you start hearing speech, you start to process it and then that starts creating knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe know, for instance, that children in the womb start to learn aspects of their language from the time the auditory cortex becomes mature. And in our own lab we found that, by around 9 months, kids can be very good at identifying words in running speech. Other people have shown this as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you know that infants can recognize words if they’re too young to speak? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe put electrodes on their head to record electrical activity from the scalp. And then we just play them sentences. These are really simple sentences, such as, “The eagle is in the nest.” And 300 milliseconds later, we play “eagle.” And then we compare the response from the electrodes to “eagle” to the response to another word that they haven’t heard. If we get a deviation in the brain activity in response to the new word compared to the replayed word, we infer that they recognize the replayed word.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHave you ever met a particular child whose language abilities gave you some new insight into language acquisition?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of my colleagues and I wrote a \u003ca href=\\\"https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2495925_2/component/file_2496119/content\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"\u003epaper\u003c/a\u003e years ago on the errors that her daughter was making. Scarlett was saying things like, “I’m are good girl” instead of “I am a good girl.” We analyzed it, and she made these errors only in specific contexts where she said “are” but meant to say “am.” This gave us insight into how she was analyzing the grammar. Scarlett gradually stopped making these errors, but at different rates in different sentences. This suggests that she linked the use of “am” to the specific sentence itself, rather than having a broad command of the use of the verb.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is consistent with a learning-based approach to language acquisition, where children learn grammar in a piecemeal fashion, rather than learning the broad rules (for example, be, is, am, are) and quickly generalizing use across a range of contexts. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe a more common mistake, one that you hear children make a lot, are these overgeneralization errors. Children will say things like, “He hitted me,” or “I sleepded,” and those errors indicate the kinds of analyses that children are making about how to form the past tense. Another one that’s a famous example is children saying, “Don’t giggle me” for “Don’t make me laugh.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow could studying language acquisition in children help adults or kids who lag behind their peers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m not sure how much it would help an adult learning a new language, except to make them very jealous!
