Weatherall, who was born in Windsor, England, rose to fame during the 1990s acid house/dance era. As well as working with the legends like New Order and Happy Mondays, his work on Primal Scream&rsquo;s Screamadelica turned it into an era-defining album, mixing the band&rsquo;s rock swagger with club influences to create a dance album injected with the furious spirit of punk.</p><p>The tributes to Weatherall have come from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/events/1229416105309065219\">far and wide</a>. BBC 6 Music DJ Giles Peterson said it was &ldquo;hard to put into words the influence and impact he has had on UK culture.&rdquo; Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh said: &ldquo;Genius is an overworked term but I&rsquo;m struggling to think of anything else that defines him.&rdquo; BBC 6 Music&rsquo;s Matt Everett said: &ldquo;As a producer he was always thinking about the wrong thing to do, which made it the right thing to do invariably. His mission to navigate the darker sides of techno simultaneously with vintage rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll made him this incredibly inventive figure.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> As a producer [Andrew Weatherall] was always thinking about the wrong thing to do, which made it the right thing to do &ndash; Matt Everett, BBC 6 Music </p></blockquote><p>Unlike DJ contemporaries such as Paul Oakenfold and Fatboy Slim, Weatherall never became a household name, deliberately following a path on the cutting edge of techno, with projects including his Boys Own label, Sabres of Paradise and Two Lone Swordsmen. &ldquo;It's a lot of work, once you go up that slippery showbiz pole,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/andrew-weatherall-interview-if-i-d-carried-on-i-d-be-on-life-support-a6884511.html\">he told the Independent in 2016</a>, &ldquo;and it would keep me away from what I like, which is making things.&rdquo;</p><p>Weatherall had a close association with BBC Music. He created the third-ever <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/janvrba3/andrew-weatherall-essential-mix-111393/\">Essential Mix</a>, and his <a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/oska_/andrew-weatherall-essential-mix-27-10-1996/\">1996 Essential Mix</a> is up there among the fans&rsquo; favourite. To pay tribute to Weatherall&rsquo;s impact on music, here are his most defining and memorable remixes.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p083sfck\"}}</p><p><strong>7. </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQuqvgXvNCE\">New Order, Regret (Sabres Slow&rsquo;n&rsquo;Low)</a><strong><br /> </strong>As the title suggests, this turns the legendary Manchester band&rsquo;s sound down a notch or 10. It manages to stay true to the spirit of the original, but adds new context by drawing out the inherent melancholy of the song, making it a rare downbeat note in Weatherall&rsquo;s remix collection.</p><p><strong>6. </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84sBbGdo_98\">Spiritualized, Come Together (Two Lone Swordsmen Remix)</a><strong><br /> </strong>Weatherall was a pioneer in spotting the seemingly invisible threads between bands, sound and melodies. A fine example of this can be found here, with the original song from the space rock explorers turned into an early morning smoke-filled jazz jam. Whiplash-like in its insistent and persistent use of high-hat, it manages to pull and warp spacetime enough to create an even woozier version than the original.</p><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAPCm76g6fs\">Saint Etienne, Only Love Can Break Your Heart (A Mix In Two Halves)</a><strong><br /> </strong>One of Weatherall&rsquo;s trademarks was creating dub symphonies for indie pop stars. If Saint Etienne&rsquo;s cover of Neil Young&rsquo;s song sounded like ethereal pop perfection, the dub-inspired A Mix In Two Halves made it sharper and deadlier. Not many people could include a spoken line like &ldquo;The DJ eases a spliff from his lyrical lips and smilingly orders &lsquo;Cease&rsquo;&rdquo; and still be respectful to the original, but somehow Weatherall made it work; the line used to divide the first Augustus Pablo-like melodica-driven half of the remix from the second, which turns into a more familiar version of the song.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p083slbp\"}}</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOinG0QCfO0\">Sabres of Paradise, Smokebelch II (Beatless Mix)</a><strong><br /> </strong>A chillout classic that may have found its way onto an endless list of compilation albums and travel show soundtracks yet still sounds as fresh as a daisy. Uplifting and poignant at the same time, it owed a huge (and uncredited) debt to underground house pioneer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp1N0iArsuU\">LB Bad&rsquo;s New Age Of Faith</a>.</p><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf73xqZvk6k\">Loaded, Primal Scream</a><strong><br /> </strong>Any track remixed on the legendary Screamadelica album could be on this list, especially Come Together and Higher Than the Sun, but without Loaded none of these could have existed. Primal Scream asked Weatherall to remix their track I&rsquo;m Losing More Than I&rsquo;ll Ever Have for the distinctly unprincely sum of &pound;500. After a first effort in which Weatherall admitted he &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26hgy4mQVdE\">basically slung a kick drum under the original</a>&rdquo;, he tore up the track &ndash; keeping around seven seconds of the bass line and slide guitar from the original, and adding everything from vocal samples from the US soul group The Emotions to a drum loop from an Italian bootleg of Edie Brickell&rsquo;s song What I Am to a sample from the 1966 Peter Fonda movie The Wild Angels to frontman Bobby Gillespie singing a line from Robert Johnson's Terraplane Blues. What emerged from this reconstruction job was Loaded, one of the defining anthems of the era, and a song that completely changed the fortunes of both Weatherall and the band. (Music journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dorianlynskey/status/1229788211251175424\">Dorian Lynsky</a> has created a <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0PbR260htpHTk5bF4jMUfN?si=yR85TK1ySaaYW-YjP8G_4g\">wonderful playlist</a> that highlights the inspirations and samples that inspired Weatherall on Screamadelica.)</p><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAEcU-cxUGM\">Happy Mondays, Hallelujah (Paul Oakenfold &amp; Andrew Weatherall Mix)</a><strong><br /> </strong>One of the defining tracks of Manchester&rsquo;s Hacienda club in the &rsquo;90s, this remix helped push baggy and indie-dance into the mainstream. The slow pulsating trance-like beat clocked in at 98 bpm, but the sound was relentless. A dub mix of the Martin Hannett-produced indie song, Weatherall had happy pianos and gospel shrieks of &ldquo;Higher!&rdquo; continuously enter and leave the scene, with the briefest, baggiest lyrics from Shaun William Ryder. A remix that was so way ahead of its time, most of us hearing it didn&rsquo;t know it yet.</p><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/audiobuffer/05-my-bloody-valentine-soon-andrew-weatherall-mix\">My Bloody Valentine, Soon (The Andrew Weatherall Mix)</a><strong> <br /> </strong>Acclaimed as one of the greatest remixes of all time, Weatherall made the kings of distortion sound like never before &ndash; lighter-hearted and fun. My Bloody Valentine&rsquo;s 1991 single from the Loveless album was completely reimagined, adding a sample from the Dynamic Corvettes&rsquo; Funky Music Is The Thing to create a shape-shifting dancefloor monster. It proved the band didn&rsquo;t always need ear-bleeding distortion to blow the audiences&rsquo; mind.</p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>The Essential List</em></a><em>.

Spotify launched in the US, as well as Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music and a Jay-Z-rebranded Tidal, and streaming figures became included in the singles and album charts. Social media broke down walls by creating direct lines of communication between artists and fans, with followers, memes and challenges on YouTube, Instagram and more recently TikTok becoming a crucial window for both fans and A&amp;R departments.</p><p>As a result, it was a time in which music became truly global, and genres seemed to mutate and fuse. Latin and K-pop became established as major genres, EDM entered the mainstream. Hip-hop was elevated to a new level, outselling rock music for the first time, and saw subgenres like trap and SoundCloud rap acheiving mainstream success. The 2010s was also bookended by two young female artists &ndash; Adele and Billie Eilish &ndash; who in their own way personified the present and future of popular music.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s our year-by-year guide to the songs we think perhaps best defined the 2010s. These aren&rsquo;t necessarily our favourite songs, or the best-selling songs, but the songs that helped define the soundtrack to the last 10 years. Listen to all the picks on our <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1am1xJwhCyqe5t730Lv5ip\" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7sKYsVBRr16OzLnYFqD8JM?si=bR44Pq4TQ3OKplY-opSrgg\">Spotify playlist here</a>.</p><p><strong>2010<br /> A-side: Adele, Rolling in the Deep</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6v7j\"}}</p><p>Apparently, Adele's 21 or 19 albums were so popular in the UK that at one stage a copy was sold every 7 seconds. Given how quickly this song became inescapable &ndash; blaring out from wine bars, TVs, and the rolled-up windows of countless school runs &ndash; it&rsquo;s remarkable just how odd Adele&rsquo;s Rolling In The Deep is. A four-to-the-floor broadside from a woman scorned, the song unleashed a Delta Blues howl that the young Brit had barely hinted at, and that propelled her to the top of the charts worldwide. But it&rsquo;s the backing vocals that elevate this to something extraordinary &ndash; cold and judgemental, where you might have expected warmth and heartfelt harmony. It&rsquo;s a masterpiece of subverting a classic, timeless form.</p><p><strong>B-side: Robyn, Dancing On My Own<br /> </strong>One of the decade&rsquo;s great disco bangers, this has remained a high mark in Robyn&rsquo;s career so far. The first of her songs to top the charts in her native Sweden, the song was a bittersweet, voyeuristic narrative, a woman dancing alone in a crowded club while her ex and his new lover look on. It may have sounded, on the surface, life-affirming, but this was bleak, wounded pop of the highest order, and set the template for a certain brand of female empowerment through angst for the rest of the decade.</p><p><strong>2011<br /> A-side: Lana Del Rey, Video Games</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwvp\"}}</p><p>Lizzy Grant was dead. Long live Lana Del Ray. Grant had played New York clubs for years under her own name, releasing a single album that sank without trace. A name change signalled a Year Zero. Out went casual clothes and a shy onstage persona &ndash; in came widescreen Sixties drama, dressed up like a glamorous gangster&rsquo;s wife on the brink of a biblical fall. For all the accusations of artifice and manufacturing (Del Ray was accused of being a record company puppet), this homage to a sordid, swinging 60s was feverishly cinematic.</p><p><strong>B-side: Rebecca Black, Friday<br /> </strong>Self-recorded tracks existed long before the internet &ndash; in the 1950s, you could have your own records pressed after warbling to your heart&rsquo;s content inside a vocal booth (Elvis Presley was signed after doing just that at Sun Records in Memphis in the 1950s). Rebecca Black only updated the tradition for the social media age. For the princely sum of $4,000, Black&rsquo;s parents created an unwitting, auto-tuned popstar, a 13-year-old girl whose beyond-innocent tribute to the end of the week went viral &ndash; more than 167 million views on YouTube in the first four months alone. The other side of social media success reared its ugly head too: Black faced an onslaught of cyberbullying with people calling it &ldquo;the worst song ever&rdquo; and creating a seemingly never-ending series of parodies.</p><p><strong>2012<br /> A-side: Psy, Gangnam Style</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6vnx\"}}</p><p>In Korean, it means &ldquo;south of the river&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s regarded as the South Korean Beverley Hills, and home to some of the world&rsquo;s priciest real estate. It even hosted the G:20 conference in 2011. But this isn&rsquo;t why you know Gangnam. In 2012, Korean rapper Psy made this affluent stretch of Seoul as well-known to pop music as London, New York, Paris, Munich. The first globe-swallowing K-pop hit, Gangnam Style made Psy &ndash; the antithesis of the chiselled, good looking K-pop pin-up &ndash; into a viral star the world over. Let&rsquo;s face it, you can still do the dance.</p><p><strong>B-side: Lorde, Royals<br /> </strong>Global popstars &ndash; with apologies to one Neil Finn &ndash; don&rsquo;t tend to come from New Zealand. That all changed with the arrival of Lorde, a teenage singer-songwriter whose development had been nurtured by a local A&amp;R since she was 12. Though the song would become a worldwide hit in 2013, it first emerged &ndash; free to download &ndash; on SoundCloud towards the end of 2012. It was the 17-year-old&rsquo;s reaction to seeing conspicuous consumption in hip-hop videos and hearing a laundry list of luxury brands on rap songs, a realisation that the world you&rsquo;re being sold is make believe. It&rsquo;s minimal production created the blueprint for the &ldquo;cutting-edge&rdquo; sound of pop, and set the scene for other global successes like Taylor Swift blockbuster <em>1989</em> album.</p><p><strong>2013<br /> A-side: Daft Punk, Get Lucky ft Pharrell Williams, Nile Rodgers<br /></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6w2f\"}}</p><p>Before Get Lucky, Daft Punk had had a relatively quiet decade &ndash; their 2005 album Human After All attracted lacklustre reviews after the well-received Discovery (2001). The duo put their robotic heads down and toured for a couple of years&hellip; and then went silent. It was only in 2013 that a new song appeared. Daft Punk had met former Chic legend Nile Rodgers at a listening party in 1997, and more than a decade-and-a-half later, Rodgers would be instrumental in making their disco-flavoured Get Lucky the song of the summer. It&rsquo;s not just down to Rodgers, either &ndash; Get Lucky&rsquo;s sinuous melodies are ever sweeter thanks to the vocals of Pharrell Williams, who had quite the year&hellip;</p><p><strong>B-side: Robin Thicke, Blurred Lines ft. TI + Pharrell<br /> </strong>A song made famous thanks to 1) a video which left little to the imagination and 2) a court case involving the mischievous lifting of one of Marvin Gaye&rsquo;s most irresistible hooks. Robin Thicke&rsquo;s song was one of three massive hits featuring Pharrell that year (see also Get Lucky and the Despicable Me 2-featured super smash Happy). The topless version of the video for Blurred Lines was removed from YouTube after only a week but it only served to add to the song&rsquo;s lustre. The line &ldquo;I know you want it&rdquo; only served to cause further issue as the #MeToo movement began to grow, causing it to be banned at student discos in the UK. Worse for Thicke and Williams was to come, when Marvin Gaye&rsquo;s estate sued claiming the track had pilfered from the club classic Got To Get It On. The case went to trial and in 2015 the pair were found guilty of copyright infringement by a jury in 2015; the song had not sampled Gaye&rsquo;s tune, but was found to have copied the feel of it &ndash; a seismic change in copyright claims which has huge implications for the industry.</p><p><strong>2014<br /> A-side: Mark Ronson, Uptown Funk ft. Bruno Mars<br /></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6w8q\"}}</p><p>Ever imagined what an updated version of Was Not Was&rsquo;s Walk The Dinosaur might sound like? Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson might have pondered that very same thought. 2014&rsquo;s least subtle singalong &ndash; at some point you can probably hear the moment a kitchen sink is thrown into the mix &ndash; Uptown Funk kisses itself at its prettiness and sweeps all before it with a seemingly unstoppable escalation. It&rsquo;s as if two bands had an arms race over who could create the most worthy descendant of The Gap Band&rsquo;s Oops Upside Your Head, and this was the end result.</p><p><strong>B-side: Meghan Trainor, All About That Bass<br /> </strong>A paean to the bottom end, just not the kind of bottom end audiophiles are usually obsessed with. Trainor was not a pop star herself, but a writer for hire when she penned the track, a collaboration with Kevin Kadish that took all of 40 minutes. Borrowing some of the tropes of doo-wop (Trainor had been a fan since she was introduced to it by her father), the soca-flavoured song is a no-description-spared celebration of the fuller figure.</p><p><strong>2015<br /> A-side: BTS, I Need U</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6wbw\"}}</p><p>It&rsquo;s the pop equivalent of the Marvel Universe. When it comes to immersing their fans in a manufactured world, few bands can match the creative vision of K-pop sensations BTS. I Need U, from their second album The Most Beautiful Moment In Life Part 2, was an electro-pop sideways move for the South Korean seven-piece, and a snapshot of the wider story the band teased out over the course of the album&rsquo;s life, through music videos, social media posts, album art and comics. In due course, K-pop and BTS in particular would become a sensation not just in South East Asia but across the world.</p><p><strong>B-side: Kendrick Lamar, Alright<br /> </strong>&ldquo;We gon&rsquo; be alright.&rdquo; The simplest of choruses, turned into an anthem for a new civil rights movement. Inspired by a trip Lamar took to South Africa, the rapper fused beats provided by man-of-the-decade Pharrell with a wake-up call for black youth, recognising the struggle from generations past was still not done. It gained further credence when that five-syllable chorus became a chant at Black Lives Matter rallies. &ldquo;We gon&rsquo; be alright&rdquo; became less a throwaway optimistic catchphrase, and more than act of defiance.</p><p><strong>2016<br /> A-side: Beyonc&eacute;, Formation</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6wg9\"}}</p><p>Beyonce&rsquo;s sixth album Lemonade broke the mould when it was released with absolutely no advanced notice. The lead single Formation was an intense, uncompromising expression of both blackness and Southern-ness, the latter something Queen Bey had often been accused of forgetting by detractors. The opening verse is unequivocal, laying waste to online gossip (&ldquo;Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess&rdquo;) before unfurling a <em>different</em> kind of Southern flag a few lines later (&ldquo;My daddy Alabama / Momma Louisiana&rdquo;). The beats were insistent, almost martial; this was a Black Power anthem musically stripped back but a lyrical <em>tour de force.</em></p><p><strong>B-side: Billie Eilish, ocean eyes<br /> </strong>Eilish came out of the blocks with real intent: Ocean Eyes was her first song, written by her older brother Finneas O&rsquo;Connell, ostensibly for his band. First released on SoundCloud in November 2015, the song helped create a buzz about Eilish when she was still only 13, the lack of record company involvement making her feel like a genuine discovery. The lyrics made an instant impression, drawing parallels to Lorde: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stop staring at those ocean skies / Burning cities and napalm skies / Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes.&rdquo; By the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191220-the-20-best-songs-of-2019\">end of the decade</a>, Eilish would become one of the defining stars of pop music.</p><p><strong>2017<br /> A-side: Luis Fonsi, Despacito ft. Daddy Yankee</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6wn5\"}}</p><p>From the Amazon to the Arctic Circle, Greenland to the Galapagos, this was the song of 2017. A collaboration between Puerto Ricans Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, the song&rsquo;s remix added Justin Bieber into the mix &ndash; and made this song the biggest Latin smash since Macarena, some 20 years before. What was an otherwise inoffensive urban-inflected pop song, mostly sung in Spanish, instead became a battering ram that broke down the barriers that had kept Latino pop off English-speaking airwaves; they now call it &ldquo;the Despacito effect&rdquo;, and the likes of Demi Lovato and Camila Cabello have followed in its wake.</p><p><strong>B-side: Ed Sheeran, Shape Of You<br /> </strong>In the UK, you know you&rsquo;ve made it when your song in used in an advert for middle class supermarket Marks &amp; Spencers. Such was the ubiquity of Shape Of You. Sheeran was already big &ndash; stadium-filling big &ndash; by the time Shape Of You shimmied its sinuous hips across the world&rsquo;s speakers in 2017. Inspired by TLC&rsquo;s No Scrubs (that tune&rsquo;s writers also get a nod on the credits) the song went on to become the biggest-selling single of 2017, and in 2018 became the first track to break two billion plays on streaming service Spotify. Originally conceived as a duet between Rihanna and rap star Rudimental, the head of Sheeran&rsquo;s label convinced him to keep the track for himself.</p><p><strong>2018<br /> A-side: Childish Gambino, This Is America</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6wpc\"}}</p><p>Polymath Donald Glover (aka Childish Gambino) was starring in an episode of Saturday Night Live when the video for This Is America dropped (by then he&rsquo;s already appeared in the Star Wars spin-off Solo: A Star Wars Story). He&rsquo;d already produced a string of albums and singles, but some reviewers wondered out loud whether Glover was too busy being an actor, comedian and DJ to come up with a proper hit. Well, that changed with This Is America and its video, a film so stacked with allusions to black life in 21st Century America that it required several viewings. A visceral diatribe against American gun culture, the video is so stuffed with visual information &ndash; especially the nods to police prejudice against black Americans &ndash; it takes several views to full take in.</p><p><strong>B-side: Ariana Grande: no tears left to cry<br /> </strong>The American singer/songwriter hadn&rsquo;t quite made the jump from star to superstardom, when her 2017 Manchester Arena concert was the target of a suicide bombing. Grande suspended the remainder of the tour and held the One Love Manchester tribute concert a few weeks later. Grande seemed to channel trauma in real time on her next album, covering her post-traumatic stress after Manchester and struggles with break-ups in an empowering way. no tears left to cry was the first single released, with the music video featuring a bee &ndash; the symbol of Manchester &ndash; an acknowledgement of strength through togetherness. Our resilience was Ari&rsquo;s, and Ari&rsquo;s resilience was ours.</p><p><strong>2019<br /> A-side: Lil&rsquo; Nas X, Old Town Road ft. Billy Ray Cyrus<br /></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z80hp\"}}</p><p>The instrumental version of this song was released in 2018, the work of Dutch beat producer YoungKio. But it would go overground thanks to a marrying of genres that still causes headscratching to this day. Rapper Lil&rsquo; Nas X snapped up the beats &ndash; which sampled banjo from a Nine Inch Nails instrumental &ndash; and bought the rights to the song for just $30; he wrote the lyrics, inspired by the tough times he was going through, in just a day. Old Town Road initially met some resistance from the country crowd; Billboard disqualified it from its country charts because it felt the song wasn&rsquo;t country enough. But Old Town Road was not to be stopped; a remix version featuring Achy Breaky Heart hitmaker Billy Ray Cyrus helped propel the song into the stratosphere. Old Town Road ended up marking 19 weeks at the top of the US charts, a record. And it broke ground for other reasons, too. Lil Nas X (real name Montero Lamar Hill) came out as gay while the record was still number one in the US, becoming the only artist in history to do so.</p><p><strong>B-side: Lizzo, Juice<br /> </strong>It could have been a classic beamed straight from the mirrorball reflected dancefloors of the early 1980s &ndash; but no, Lizzo&rsquo;s Juice was a fresh hit from 2019, the anthem for a thousand body-positive Instagram posts. The song Truth Hurts had been a sleeper hit in 2018, but it was a sinker compared to Juice; a bold as brass self-love anthem about as subtle as a Transformers film. Juice&rsquo;s mile-high chorus (&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t my fault that I'm out here gettin&rsquo; loose/ Gotta blame it on the Goose/ Gotta blame it on my juice, baby&rdquo;) was as infectious as any in living memory.</p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>The Essential List</em></a><em>.

James Bond movie theme tunes have become an indelible part of pop music culture.</p><p>Almost from the get-go, with Sean Connery&rsquo;s industry-creating turn as the suave secret agent in Dr No, the Bond films&rsquo; producers hit upon a formula as long-lasting as the secret agent himself.</p><p>While each official Eon Productions Bond film has featured the characteristic theme tune by Monty Norman &ndash; you&rsquo;re humming it now &ndash; they have also featured a secret weapon, one which makes each film as distinct as the villain the vodka-martini-sipping spy has to despatch: the theme song.</p><p>It&rsquo;s impossible to think of Live And Let Die (1973) without Wings&rsquo; apocalyptic slice of rock opera, or A View To A Kill (1985) without Duran Duran&rsquo;s grandiose theme song. And that&rsquo;s before we even consider Shirley Bassey&rsquo;s masterclasses of cinematic unsubtlety with Goldfinger.</p><p>So, spare a thought for those well-known artists who penned a Bond theme hoping for immortality, only for it to be rejected on the casting couch.

Lyrically, Cash&rsquo;s failed Bond theme follows the film&rsquo;s plot faithfully &ndash; coastal city menaced by a ship containing a giant bomb &ndash; in a cinematic country style full of whooping backing vocals and booming brass. Tom Jones, of course, may have recorded the actual theme, but Cash&rsquo;s effort is a champion among failures.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R500VKA9-Zo\">Alice Cooper, The Man With The Golden Gun</a></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05mxjwc\"}}</p><p><strong><em>Film:</em></strong>The Man With The Golden Gun (1974)<br /> <strong><em>Lost to:</em></strong> Lulu <br /> <strong><em>Better than the chosen theme?</em> </strong>No<strong><br /> <em>Most Bond-like lyric:</em> </strong>The man with the golden/Gun in his pocket/ The man with the golden/ Gun in your face</p><p>In an alternate universe, Alice Cooper could have been a perfect Bond villain &ndash; or at the very least, a scene-stealing henchman (secret weapon &ndash; a flame-throwing guitar, perhaps?). And in another alternate universe, it would have been him singing the theme to the 1974 Roger Moore film. This restrained glam-rock offcut certainly isn&rsquo;t one of Cooper&rsquo;s cast iron classics, and also suffers from virtually no relation to the actual film apart from the title. Less a classy cocktail lounge, more a dive bar at 2am with The Sweet on the jukebox.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2Y-hCydiXA\">Blondie, For Your Eyes Only</a></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p073s271\"}}</p><p><strong><em>Film:</em></strong> For Your Eyes Only (1981)<br /> <strong><em>Lost to:</em></strong> Sheena Easton<br /> <strong><em>Better than the chosen theme?</em> </strong>No<strong><br /> <em>Most Bond-like lyric: </em></strong>We both have our orders/ And a trick up the sleeve</p><p>You might have been forgiven for thinking that this track, on Blondie&rsquo;s last studio album before they split for 17 years, was one of those great pop coincidences, coming just a year after Sheena Easton&rsquo;s theme for the Roger Moore-starring film. But coincidence it was not. The song had originally been earmarked as the theme, but at the 11th hour the producers plumped for Sheena Easton instead. Blondie&rsquo;s stab at Bond Universe immortality came to nothing.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAqmN8Gd39E\">Pet Shop Boys, Theme For James Bond #1</a></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p081b099\"}}</p><p><strong><em>Film:</em></strong>The Living Daylights (1987)<br /> <strong><em>Lost to:</em></strong> A-ha<br /> <strong><em>Better than the chosen theme?</em> </strong>Yes<strong><br /> <em>Most Bond-like lyric: </em></strong>Like the taciturn Chis Lowe, there are no lyrics</p><p>The song that eventually became This Must Be The Place I Waited Years To Leave from the PSB&rsquo;s 1990 album Behaviour, was originally earmarked for Timothy Dalton&rsquo;s debut as Bond &ndash; the producers had been impressed with the chart success of Duran Duran&rsquo;s A View To A Kill a few years before. The choice eventually went to Norwegian pop trio A-ha, but the finished track from the &ldquo;banger-crafting loveable uncles&rdquo;, as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20200121-why-pet-shop-boys-are-still-the-cleverest-men-in-pop\">BBC Culture calls them</a>, is the very essence of the duo&rsquo;s suburban ennui. a tale of rain-soaked misery at some nameless English school.

The band were sounded out for a possible Bond Theme for Pierce Brosnan&rsquo;s 1995 Bond debut GoldenEye. A demo was recorded but then passed over in favour of Tina Turner&rsquo;s offering, which had been written by U2&rsquo;s Bono and The Edge.

One on the longlist was Pulp, the Britpop band who had become national treasure in the UK thanks to 1995&rsquo;s Common People. In true Bond-ticking-timer tradition, apparently, they didn&rsquo;t have much time to do it, either</p><p>&ldquo;It was weird. They set up a kind of&nbsp;American Idol situation, where they asked about nine different artists to come up with a Bond song,&rdquo; frontman <a href=\"https://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=6504\">Jarvis Cocker told Time Out</a>. They listen to nine different attempts of working &ldquo;tomorrow never dies&rdquo; into a lyric. We were told on a Wednesday that the deadline was Friday. Consequently, I was really pissed off when they went with Sheryl Crow instead.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avM_UsVo0IA\">Muse, Supremacy</a></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07w6xpj\"}}</p><p><strong><em>For:</em></strong>Skyfall (2012)<br /> <strong><em>Lost to:</em></strong> Adele<br /> <strong><em>Better than the chosen theme? </em></strong>Yes in bombast, no in actual tune<strong><br /> <em>Most Bond-like lyric:</em> </strong>You don&rsquo;t have long/ I am on to you/ The time it has come to destroy/ Your supremacy</p><p>Team Bond didn&rsquo;t ask, but Muse might have been offering it anyway. In a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19699744\">2012 interview with the BBC</a>, the band&rsquo;s drummer Dom Howard laughed off the thought of their histrionic rock opera gracing the titles. But was he really joking? \"It's got a little whisper to the Bond vibe &ndash; it all goes a bit crazy Live and Let Die in the middle. My view is they should use it for the next James Bond film, but I don't know what's going on with that.

The band recorded it around the session for their 2016 album A Moon Shaped Pool; the Bond team decided, in the end, it was too dark. Though given the end result - Spectre&rsquo;s opening sequence is a decidedly creepy affair, with Kraken-like octopuses and Mexican death masks &ndash; this was never going to be a job for the likes of Katy Perry.</p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>The Essential List</em></a><em>.

62nd Annual Grammy Awards will take place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles over this weekend, and Song Of The Year is one of the most coveted prizes. Win this, and you join a hallowed hall featuring songs from only the most respected songwriters of the modern era: The Beatles, Frank Sinatra, Elton John and, er, The Doobie Brothers (well, it was the end of the Seventies).</p><p>The Grammys recognition of the greatest song of the year is a little more complicated than most awards. Song Of The Year rewards the songwriters who wrote and composed the song, but the awards also have Record Of The Year, a prize that goes to the singer and production team.</p><p>Last year, This Is America by Childish Gambino won the Song Of The Year award, this year the nominations are:</p><p>Always Remember Us This Way (Lady Gaga)<br /> Bad Guy (Billie Eilish)<br /> Bring My Flowers Now (Tanya Tucker)<br /> Hard Place (H.E.R.)<br /> Lover (Taylor Swift)<br /> Norman F***ing Rockwell (Lana Del Rey)<br /> Someone You Loved (Lewis Capaldi)<br /> Truth Hurts (Lizzo)</p><p>For 60 years the Song Of The Year category has rewarded songs that have become part of our aural history. It&rsquo;s also thrown up some mystifying decisions too. Ahead of the ceremony this year, here&rsquo;s BBC Music&rsquo;s potted history of the the Song Of The Year award in 14 facts. [Note: the years cited are those in which the songs were released and were awarded for, not the year the ceremony took place, which is the following year.]</p><p><strong>The first Song Of The Year was in Italian<br /> </strong>The US music industry is big and broad enough to have overwhelmingly swelled the ranks of Song Of The year winners. But when the category kicked off in 1959, the Grammy Awards judges gave the prize to Domenico Modugno&rsquo;s Volare. The song had already been Italy&rsquo;s entry into the Eurovision Song Contest in 1958 and spent five weeks at the top of the Billboard charts, turning Modugno into a household name. Modugno, incidentally, later became a member of parliament in Italy and an outspoken critic of Chilean dictator August Pinochet &ndash; so much so that he was denied entry to Chile to play a concert.</p><p><strong>Jimmy Webb&rsquo;s surprising win</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08137vx\"}}</p><p>Jimmy Webb&rsquo;s By the Time I Get To Phoenix is regarded as one of the classic songs of the 1960s, made even more memorable by the honeyed tones of the late Glen Campbell. The Grammy panel rightly gave it a nomination for best song in 1967, but the song was beaten by Up, Up And Away &ndash; also written by Webb. Thus, The 5th Dimension&rsquo;s ode to hot-air ballooning made it into the Grammy history books, instead of one of the greatest essays of romantic longing ever recorded.</p><p><strong>Little Green Apples beats The Beatles<br /> </strong>Bobby Russell&rsquo;s Little Green Apples is a masterpiece of lyrical songwriting; the kind of country song that makes you feel you&rsquo;re right in the room with the characters. It was originally recorded by country legend Roger Miller, though the song&rsquo;s confessional approach meant other singers soon clamoured to cover it. Patti Page and OC Smith both covered it in 1968, and Smith&rsquo;s version earned Russell the Song Of The Year Grammy. Some might have thought that another song that made the category that year might have triumphed, however The Beatles&rsquo; Hey Jude missed out.</p><p><strong>The Beatles won only once</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08137jj\"}}</p><p>In fact, though Lennon and McCartney may arguably be the most successful songwriting partnership in pop history, nods from the Grammy judges were conspicuous by their absence. The band won only once, for the song Michelle, off the album Rubber Soul. The choice was all the more interesting given that the song wasn&rsquo;t released as a single, and the album never topped the charts in the US (though Michelle was the most popular Rubber Soul track on US radio).</p><p><strong>Playing it safe in the &lsquo;70s<br /> </strong>Halfway through the 1970s, the Grammy judges still seemed to be keeping modern pop at arm&rsquo;s length, celebrating instead the folkier charms of Simon &amp; Garfunkel and the can-you-hear-me-at-the-back music hall projection of Barbra Streisand. 1975 was a year which saw a string of pop classics &ndash; from The Bee Gees&rsquo; Jive Talkin&rsquo; to KC &amp; The Sunshine Band&rsquo;s Get Down Tonight and David Bowie&rsquo;s extraordinary Fame. What did the jury go for? Judy Collins&rsquo; Send In The Clowns.</p><p><strong>No place for Bond</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08137n5\"}}</p><p>Say what you like about the James Bond films, but they have directly birthed a handful of fantastic pop songs, including Wings&rsquo; Live &amp; Let Die and Louis Armstrong&rsquo;s velvet-smooth We Have All The Time In The World. But one &ndash; and only one &ndash; has earned a nomination for Song Of The Year. Carly Simon&rsquo;s Nobody Does It Better was the theme to 1977&rsquo;s The Spy Who Loved Me, written by composer Marvin Hamlisch and lyricist Carole Bayer Sager. It lost out, however, to two another compositions for films &ndash; Evergreen (the theme to A Star Is Born) and You Light Up My Life, from the film of the same name. Incidentally, that&rsquo;s the only time two songs have shared the prize.</p><p><strong>Doobie Bother</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p081382r\"}}</p><p>Jimmy Webb wasn&rsquo;t the only artist to enjoy a double nomination. The Doobie Brothers&rsquo; Michael McDonald also found himself up for the award twice in the same year, though with two different writing partners. Studio Doobie Lester Abrams co-wrote the single Minute By Minute with McDonald, but a place on the podium was assured thanks to the latter&rsquo;s song with Kenny Loggins, What A Fool Believes.</p><p><strong>No song success for Jackson </strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08137qv\"}}</p><p>Few &rsquo;80s artists apart from Madonna and Prince could hold a candle to Michael Jackson, but despite his chart-topping domination, neither he nor his songwriting partners had even a sniff of songwriting success during the 80s &ndash; apart from Jackson&rsquo;s part in the Ethiopia famine charity single We Are The World, with Jackson co-credited alongside Lionel Richie. There was more to be thankful for in the Record Of The Year category at least: Beat It won the category for 1983, and Thriller also won Album Of The Year.</p><p><strong>Bette Midler&rsquo;s double run</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08138y6\"}}</p><p>Think of 1989 and a clutch of classic singles spring to mind &ndash; Madonna&rsquo;s Like A Prayer, The B-52s&rsquo; Love Shack, Cher&rsquo;s Turn Back Time and Soul II Soul&rsquo;s Back To Life, to name but a few. What did the Grammy judges plump for? Seemingly possessed by the spirit of a Broadway theatrical agent, the Grammy panel rewarded Bette Midler&rsquo;s Wind Beneath My Wings, and followed it up a year later with another prize, this time for the equally maudlin From A Distance. In generations to come, music historians may come up with the idea that Midler was the female pre-eminent pop artist of the &rsquo;80s. It&rsquo;s as if Madonna never happened.</p><p><strong>The year music went to the movies</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08137pz\"}}</p><p>Music and movies have always gone hand in hand, and the Grammys and the Oscars have been regular dance partners. But 1994 was noteworthy even amid Hollywood themes to shoehorn their way into the proceedings. That year, no less than three of the songs in contention for the prize were from films. The Lion King soundtrack gave Elton John and Tim Rice two nods for the songs Circle Of Life and Can You Feel The Love, but victory went instead to Bruce Springsteen for the downbeat Streets Of Philadelphia.</p><p><strong>Illustrious omissions</strong><br /> Given that the Grammy&rsquo;s have a public reputation of largely rewarding commercial rather than critical success, it&rsquo;s odd that several of the pop world&rsquo;s biggest artists have never been recognised &ndash; or even nominated. The Rolling Stones, Madonna, David Bowie and Queen have never even been nominated, while Prince&rsquo;s one nomination was for Sinead O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s version of Nothing Compares To You.</p><p><strong>Beautiful day for U2</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08137kx\"}}</p><p>U2, on the other hand, were nominated in 1987 for I Still Haven&rsquo;t Found What I&rsquo;m Looking For, though the Linda Ronstadt/James Ingram duet Somewhere Out There ultimately proved the winner. But U2&rsquo;s day would come in the 2000s, with a double whammy five years apart. Beautiful Day &ndash; widely regarded as something of a commercial return to form after the dance rock antics half a decade earlier &ndash; took the honours for 2000, and five years later they followed it up with another for Sometimes You Can&rsquo;t Make It On Your Own. Some things truly do come to those who wait.</p><p><strong>Seven&rsquo;s up for songwriters</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08138dq\"}}</p><p>Songwriting often demands company &ndash; bouncing ideas off each other, helping songs take shape from those sparks of inspiration. But pity whoever had to pay the pizza bill for the songwriting session that birthed Bruno Mars&rsquo; That&rsquo;s What I Like, which took the award for 2017. No less than seven writers &ndash; including Mars himself &ndash; contributed, a record that will likely take some beating. The most songwriters in this year&rsquo;s nominations are five &ndash; for Hard Place by H.E.R. and Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi.</p><p><strong>Growing choice for the award<br /> </strong>When the category was invented only five songs went head-to-head. Nowadays &ndash; possibly because our streaming and download culture now favours the song over the album &ndash; this year&rsquo;s prize is now contested by eight songs. Well, the human population has more than doubled in that time, so we suppose that&rsquo;s only fair.</p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>The Essential List</em></a><em>.

In 2018, the only one of its best album nominees not to play one of their songs live was the only woman up for the prize &ndash; Lorde. The same year, U2 were featured no less than three times during the broadcast, despite not even being up for an award. The awards consistently overlooked dance music, only creating a category for it in 1998, a decade since the heyday of dance culture. And the less said about the Grammy&rsquo;s arm&rsquo;s length relationship with hip-hop the better.</p><p>The awards&rsquo; sometimes dizzying list of categories &ndash; which currently stands at 78, having been cut from 109 in 2012 &ndash; means artists in all sorts of less high-profile genres (jazz, comedy, children&rsquo;s) get their nods alongside the usual red-carpet favourites. For instance, Elmo the Muppet has won a Grammy three times &ndash; for Best Musical Album for Children in 1998 (Elmopalooza!), 1999 (The Adventures Of Elmo In Grouchland), and 2001 (Elmo And The Orchestra).</p><p>But at the heart of the Grammy conundrum is often a dilemma &ndash; whether to recognise the uncompromisingly artistic, or plump for the safer bet. No category bears that out better than Album of the Year. This time round, the panel seems to have done a decent job, balancing the pop likes of Arianna Grande and Billie Eilish with critical darlings such as Bon Iver and Lana Del Ray. But BBC Music looks at some of the times the Grammy panel got it noticeably wrong. [Note: the years cited are those in which the albums were released and were awarded for, not the year the ceremony took place, which is the following year.]</p><p><strong>1969</strong><br /> <strong>Won:&nbsp;</strong>Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears<br /> <strong>Should have won:&nbsp;</strong>The Beatles, Abbey Road<br /> Canadian jazz fusionists Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears made their first big splash with a cover of Brenda Holloway&rsquo;s You Make Me So Very Happy, So well-received, in fact, that the Grammy judges decided that the penultimate album by the most influential rock band of all time &ndash; one containing the likes of Come Together and Something &ndash; just didn&rsquo;t cut the mustard in the same way as did a jazz-tinged odyssey that included interpretations of Erik Satie and a cover of Cream&rsquo;s Sunshine Of Your Mind.</p><p><strong>1980</strong><br /> <strong>Won:&nbsp;</strong>Christopher Cross, Christopher Cross<br /> <strong>Should have won:&nbsp;</strong>AC/DC, Back In Black, or The Clash, London Calling <br /> It was a momentous year for rock, partly thanks to two phenomenal records. AC/DC reconvened after the death of their charismatic frontman Bon Scott with an emphatic call to arms. This memorial to Scott &ndash; encrypted on the leather lungs of new frontman Brian Johnson &ndash; is arguably the most popular hard rock album in history. The Clash, meantime, negotiated the revolution of punk mostly intact, and cut their masterwork, a double album which cemented their place in rock&rsquo;s pantheon &ndash; and coining a timeless anthem that will still be hummed long after London is swallowed by the Thames.</p><p>So what did the jury crown? Adult-oriented radio favourite Christopher Cross&rsquo;s self-titled debut, home of tasteful radio staples such as Sailing and Ride Like The Wind.</p><p><strong>1984</strong><br /> <strong>Won:</strong>&nbsp;Lionel Richie, Can&rsquo;t Slow Down<br /> <strong>Should have won: </strong>Bruce Springsteen, Born In The USA<br /> Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s long, steady climb from New Jersey word-of-mouth to bona fide cultural figurehead reached its high-water mark with Born In the USA, an album as inescapable in Aberdeen, Auckland and Augsburg as it was in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The toast of 1984 stadium rock might have got a nomination nod from the voting panel, but that was as far as it went. Former Commodore Lionel Richie was very much the captain of the Album of the Year category that year, for the album that featured the chart-tastic likes of Penny Lover, All Night and Hello. Or Goodbye, as it very much was for Springsteen&rsquo;s biggest album.</p><p><strong>1989</strong><br /> <strong>Won:</strong>&nbsp;Bonnie Raitt, Nick Of Time<br /> <strong>Should have won:</strong>&nbsp;Tom Petty, Full Moon Fever<br /> No disrespect to Bonnie Raitt, a Californian country legend whose Nick Of Time was a deserved breakthrough after a run of bad luck in the 1980s &ndash; not least being dropped by her record company a day after recording the album Tongue In Groove. As good as Nick Of Time was, however, it made only a small splash outside of country-lovin&rsquo; circles. The same can&rsquo;t be said for Tom Petty&rsquo;s Full Moon Fever, an album recorded by producer Jeff Lynne of ELO as the pair also contributed to the Traveling Wilburys side project. Full Moon Fever was Petty&rsquo;s first solo album, though virtually all of his band The Heartbreakers contributed. It &nbsp;included Won&rsquo;t Back Down and Free Fallin&rsquo;, two of Petty&rsquo;s biggest hits, sprinkled with Lynn&rsquo;s characteristic Beatles-esque production sheen.</p><p><strong>1992<br /> Won:</strong>&nbsp;Eric Clapton, MTV&hellip; Unplugged<br /> <strong>Should have won:</strong>&nbsp;Nirvana, Nevermind<br /> Chart pedants, relax. Yes, Nevermind was actually released in 1991, but it didn&rsquo;t go overground until the following year. The Grammys usually only rewarded slow-burning albums in the year they actually blew up, hence Nevermind being odds on for success the year later. Except&hellip; the album wasn&rsquo;t even nominated. The Grammy voting jury, in their wisdom felt Eric Clapton&rsquo;s caf&eacute;-friendly MTV&hellip; Unplugged, Annie Lennox&rsquo;s Diva and the soundtrack to Disney&rsquo;s Beauty And The Best more deserving of nods than an album that changed the way rock sounded &ndash; and looked &ndash; for a generation. As it was, Clapton won, proving that quiet was very much the new loud.</p><p><strong>1996</strong><br /> <strong>Won:</strong>&nbsp;Celine Dion, Falling Into You<br /> <strong>Should have won:</strong>&nbsp;Beck, Odelay<br /> Two years later, another ocean-going clanger. Beck&rsquo;s Odelay was rightly lauded as the album of 1996, a melange of country, folk, hip hop that grew out of largely acoustic sessions in 1994. Beck scrapped these and indeed hooked up with production duo The Dust Brothers (who had previously worked with the Beastie Boys) to produce something much more layered than his breakthrough Mellow Gold. But the ceremony showed that &ndash; once again &ndash; the Grammy voters preferred something with a little more dramatic wind in its sails. Cue Celine Dion&rsquo;s Falling Into You &ndash; the album which included Dion&rsquo;s seismograph-bothering version of Eric Carmen&rsquo;s All By Myself. Odelay, despite being nominated, sat this one out on the sidelines.</p><p><strong>1997<br /> Won:</strong>&nbsp;Bob Dylan, Time Out Of Mind<br /> <strong>Should have won: </strong>Radiohead, OK Computer<br /> In 1997, Bob Dylan revitalised a flagging muse with Time Out Of Mind, an album which saw him pairing up with producer Daniel Lanois, the Canadian who had produced U2 in the 80s and helmed Dylan&rsquo;s own Oh Mercy album in 1989. The album brought a more experimental sheen to Dylan&rsquo;s work &ndash; Lanois, after all, was massively involved in U2&rsquo;s Achtung Baby &ndash; but the generally positive reviews did include some who wondered if the record was less a Dylan masterpiece and more a demonstration of Lanois&rsquo; prowess in the studio. Radiohead, on the other hand, had released an LP widely regarded as one of the best of the decade: Pink Floyd levels of existential despair as the clock ticked closer to the end of the millennium.</p><p><strong>2000</strong><br /> <strong>Won:</strong>&nbsp;Steely Dan, Two Against Nature<br /> <strong>Should have won:&nbsp;</strong>Eminem, The Marshall Mathers LP, or Radiohead, Kid A<br /> Steely Dan were rightly lauded for their bright, smart, jazz-tinged take on pop. Much of that lauding, of course, took place in the 1970s, when the duo of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen produced their most enduring work. After 1980&rsquo;s Gaucho they called it a day for 13 years, before reuniting for concerts and, eventually, another album, 2000&rsquo;s Two Against Nature. But the album came out the same year as one of the most controversial &ndash; and best-selling &ndash; hip-hop albums of all time, Eminem&rsquo;s third album The Marshall Mathers LP.</p><p>Radiohead had also been up for contention with Kid A, a sideways swerve from the doom-laden modern prog of OK Computer into more electronic realms; it&rsquo;s today regarded as a radically successful sideways step, and a classic of the electronic genre. A classic to many, but not the Grammy voting panel, it would seem. But hey, at least they were nominated this time.</p><p><strong>2004</strong><br /> <strong>Won:</strong>&nbsp;Ray Charles and Friends, Genius Loves Company<br /> <strong>Should have won:</strong> Kanye West &ndash; The College Dropout, or Franz Ferdinand, Franz Ferdinand<br /> Steely Dan&rsquo;s win in 2000 underlines a frustrating flaw that can affect twilight career albums from established artists. In much the same way that overlooked veteran directors sometimes pick up an Oscar for lesser, later work, the Grammys can reward artists for their continued presence. It&rsquo;s also possible that the pain of losing blue legend Ray Charles &ndash; who died in June 2004 &ndash; brought Genius Loves Company into sharp relief when it was released posthumously a few months later. It was a relaxed but unspectacular duets record, pairing Charles with the likes of Willie Nelson, Norah Jones and Diana Krall.</p><p>You could argue that two classic albums of that year could have won the prize. Franz Ferdinand&rsquo;s eponymous debut was a genuine sensation, a hit record across the globe, and the perfect distillation of frontman Alex Kapranos&rsquo; desire to write songs &ldquo;your girlfriend will dance to&rdquo;, angular and interesting and yet laden with radio-friendly hooks. Kanye West&rsquo;s The College Dropout, meanwhile, remains arguably his creative zenith. Recorded over four years while West was rebuffed by record label after record label, The College Dropout fizzed with relentless energy.</p><p><strong>2007<br /> Won:&nbsp;</strong>Herbie Hancock, River: The Joni Letters<br /> <strong>Should have won:&nbsp;</strong>Amy Winehouse, Back To Black<br /> On paper, Amy Winehouse&rsquo;s defining album, Back To Black, was perfect Grammy fodder. Winehouse herself seemed beamed in from an old Hollywood movie, all heartache, beehive hairdo and eyeliner, the music shimmering in a retro haze that heightened its drama and longing. But while Winehouse did pick up Record of the Year for Rehab, the album which spawned it was overlooked for jazz-funk pioneer Herbie Hancock&rsquo;s River: The Joni Letters, an album which reimagined the songs of Joni Mitchell via a cast of collaborators including Leonard Cohen, Norah Jones, Tina Turner and Corinne Bailey Rae. A respectful tip of the hat to a living legend &ndash; but not a record that has the legacy Back To Black enjoys more than a decade later.</p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>The Essential List</em></a><em>.

Born in LA, Celeste was three when her parents split, and she moved to the UK with her mother. She began singing around 10 years ago when she was inspired by hearing Elton John's Your Song, and wrote her first song at 16. She released an EP with Lily Allen&rsquo;s Bank Holiday Records label in 2017.

Here are the tracks that topped our playlist, setting the scene for an exciting decade to come. You can listen to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6rf4M1qZUHXZD97oBpZGn8\">all 20 tracks here</a> <em>(Warning: Contains some language that may offend)</em></p><p><strong><em>20. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbcLcSY2au4\"><strong><em>Megan Thee Stallion, Hot Girl Summer</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwr6\"}}</p><p>The meme that turned into a movement; the song was an unapologetic call to have a good time and not give a flying flamingo about what anybody thinks. Everyone from Wendy&rsquo;s to Maybelline co-opted the phrase to such a degree that the artist eventually trademarked the phrase. Collaborating with Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla $ign on the track was a massive poke in the eye for anyone still thinking only one rap queen can reign supreme.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Handle me? Who gon&rsquo; handle me?/ Thinkin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s a player, he&rsquo;s a member on the team.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>19. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIcVwH47uxQ\"><strong><em>Big Thief, Not</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>The Brooklyn-based band have always won praise for finding majesty in the minutiae, and 2019 was a landmark year with two albums (UFOF and Two Hands). The top track was the lead single on the latter album, pain piercing through every one of singer/songwriter Adrianne Lenker&rsquo;s razor-sharp words. The guitar solo, or more accurately a guitar roar, is worthy of Neil Young at his peak.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the open weaving/ Nor the furnace glow/ Nor the blood of you bleeding/ As you try to let go.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>18. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84\"><strong><em>FKA twigs, Cellophane</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwrl\"}}</p><p>The British singer/songwriter&rsquo;s breathtaking, hypnotic return after three years. Stripped down to a piano-led arrangement, this tale of a relationship souring despite giving your all drew obvious parallels to the artist&rsquo;s public break up with Robert Pattinson. The fearless fragility of twigs&rsquo;s voice made heartbreak sound like being raised to the skies before crashing down to earth.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;I try but I get overwhelmed/ When you're gone, I have no one to tell.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>17. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6giKIu5jUvA\"><strong><em>Solange, Almeda</em></strong></a><br /> The sound of black pride in 2019. Solange presented a freeze frame of the area of Houston she grew up in while reciting a list of beautiful things (&ldquo;brown face, black skin, black braids, black waves&rdquo;). Playboi Carti and The-Dream joined the celebration, adding weight and joy to the mood. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;These are black-owned things/ Black faith still can&rsquo;t be washed away/ Not even in that Florida water.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>16. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZsNnuaUSNs\"><strong><em>slowthai, Nothing Great About Britain</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwrz\"}}</p><p>A snarling, pessimistic portrait of Britain from the street &ndash; covering Brexit, class warfare, and widening inequality &ndash; but told with bluntness, wit and wordplay. slowthai makes a mockery of Britishness, but he also celebrates his country, in part through the clear doffing of his cap to a host of musical influences, including Sex Pistols, The Streets and Dizzee Rascal.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I will treat you with the utmost respect only if you respect me a little bit, Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>15. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvNqNgHAEys\"><strong><em>Holly Herndon, Frontier</em></strong></a><br /> Herndon&rsquo;s third album, Proto, saw her collaborating with vocal performers and the digital voice of an AI program called Spawn. One of its most stunning and human moments came on Frontier. Inspired by Appalachian Sacred Harp singing, a single voice builds to a vocal crescendo that blurs the difference between human and machine in ways that feel comfortable, disorientating and heart-warming all at once.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;This earth doesn't care for what we need, what we breathe/ A frontier of green or of dust.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>14. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yljWf3_flbM\"><strong><em>The Highwomen, If She Ever Leaves Me</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwt4\"}}</p><p>It was billed as the first gay country song, which isn&rsquo;t strictly speaking true, but the lead track from the all-female supergroup is certainly the most high-profile one to date. Brandi Carlile subverts country ballad tradition, sending a warning to a male cowboy who has an eye on her female partner, which also felt like a welcome rejoinder to the machismo that can pervade the genre. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em>&ldquo;</strong>If she ever gives her careful heart to somebody new, well, it won&rsquo;t be for a cowboy like you.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>13. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCuhuePlP8o\"><strong><em>Lewis Capaldi, Someone You Loved</em></strong></a><br /> Scottish singer-songwriter Capaldi became the somewhat improbable break-out star of the year. His album Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent was the fastest-selling UK album of the year. And Someone You Loved topped both the UK and US singles chart &ndash; its straightforward tale about a break-up and Capaldi&rsquo;s raspy soulful voice capturing the imagination of a vast swathe of lovelorn fans.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>12. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSSKDIcpdSE\"><strong><em>Little Simz, Selfish</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwtc\"}}</p><p>It may have been a long time coming, but the London rapper is finally achieving the success that has been predicted by everyone from Kendrick Lamar to Forbes magazine. So, it&rsquo;s perhaps appropriate that it came in the slicker sound and form of Selfish. Haters are always going to hate, the rapper defiantly states, but no-one can question what she&rsquo;s earned through her own hard graft and creativity. And who are we to argue?<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;No validation, no applause/ You don&rsquo;t have to prove you got it when you know it&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>11. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDUPSNdmFew\"><strong><em>Dave, Black</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>From the groundbreaking Mercury Prize-winning album came a track that was a laser-sharp examination of contemporary racism and racial identity. The south London rapper tackles colonialism, social mobility and media coverage, but like Solange, the song is also peppered with pride about his blackness. UK listeners complained when it appeared on the Radio 1 playlist, but DJ Annie Mac replied: &ldquo;If you are genuinely offended by a man talking about the colour of his skin and how it has shaped his identity then that is a problem for you.&rdquo;<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;A kid dies, the blacker the killer, the sweeter the news/ And if he's white you give him a chance, he&rsquo;s ill and confused.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>10. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chSZCtLrgz8\"><strong><em>Charli XCX &ndash; Gone (feat Christine and the Queens)</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwtv\"}}</p><p>Sometimes a partnership makes more sense on paper than in the studio, sometimes it more than delivers on the promise. Gone is firmly in the latter camp, the two pop mavericks creating an uncompromising, existential anti-social anthem. It&rsquo;s a collaborative cri de coeur about the weight of expectation, with the unrelenting electro-funk beat providing the perfect soundtrack to their catharsis. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Am I a smoke? Am I the sun? Who decides?&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>9. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmAsUQEFYGI\"><strong><em>Tyler, The Creator, Earfquake</em></strong></a><br /> Originally written with Justin Beiber in mind, and later offered to and rejected by Rhianna, Earfquake finds the rapper singing in heartbreak mode, pleading a lover not to leave over summer sounds and harmonies. His trademark sound is boosted by vocals from R&amp;B legend Charlie Wilson, Devont&eacute; Hyne and (as it turns out, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/1142152753474617344/photo/1\">untranscribable</a>) ad-libs from Playboi Carti.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;You don't want no complication, no/ I don't want no side information/ I just need to know what's happening/ 'cause I'm for real.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>8. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7sTHoeH0eA\"><strong><em>Sharon Van Etten, Seventeen</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwv7\"}}</p><p>A self-declared love letter to New York, Seventeen is up there amongst Van Etten&rsquo;s finest work. It&rsquo;s for anyone who has ever peered back into their past and worried whether or not age has improved them. With Van Etten you don&rsquo;t quite know the answer, but let&rsquo;s face it that&rsquo;s life, and Van Etten brilliantly captures the scrambled, jumbled emotions between nostalgia and hindsight.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re gonna be/You&rsquo;ll crumple it up just to see/Afraid that you&rsquo;ll be just like me!&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>7. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlkTVMMkCP4\"><strong><em>Vampire Weekend, Harmony Hall</em></strong></a><br /> A track that&rsquo;s the equivalent of opening the curtains and letting the spring sun shine in, Harmony Hall sees the band subtly refining their sound, with Ezra Koenig&rsquo;s most poignant and accessible lyrics to date. If you like the acoustic guitar riff, rejoice, there&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5926&amp;v=qa1t5bjJbms\">two hours-worth of it here</a>.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Anger wants a voice/ Voices wanna sing/ Singers harmonize/ &lsquo;Til they can&rsquo;t hear anything.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>6. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F9jesjJMz0\"><strong><em>Lana Del Rey, The greatest</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwvp\"}}</p><p>A comedown anthem for the burned-out generation. Del Rey focused her swooning cinematic style on the American Dream, or what she thinks is left of it. The Greatest takes a sombre and elegiac view of a country swamped by political anxiety, climate change, celebrity culture, and even the false alarm of a nuclear attack on Hawaii. The apocalypse may not be now, but in Del Rey&rsquo;s hands it feels both horrifying and beautiful.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;The culture is lit and I had a ball/ I guess that I'm burned out after all.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>5. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7bfOZek9t4\"><strong><em>Rosal&iacute;a feat J Balvin &amp; El Guincho, Con Altura</em></strong></a><br /> Rosal&iacute;a has been making waves with her contemporary take on flamenco, but this is the song that put her on the international map. An effortless fusion of traditional music with old-school reggaet&oacute;n and a dash of Middle-Eastern inspiration, Rosal&iacute;a created a sound all of her own &ndash; a sound that feels a lot like the future of global pop music.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;Vivo r&aacute;pido y no tengo cura/ Ir&eacute; joven pa&rsquo; la sepulture.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>4. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9HYJbe9Y18\"><strong><em>Clairo, Bags</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwvz\"}}</p><p>Breaking up is hard to do, and sometimes even harder to explain. The lead Rostam Batmanglij-produced single from Clairo&rsquo;s album Immunity, achingly explores the kind of insignificant, unspoken things that accumulate and coalesce into the moment when a loved one walks out the door with those bags. Low-key, touching and heart-felt, the song elevated the 21-year-old from You Tube phenomenon to bona fide pop star. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Can you see me? I&rsquo;m waiting for the right time / I can&rsquo;t read you, but if you want, the pleasure&rsquo;s all mine.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>3. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ysFgElQtjI\"><strong><em>Lil Nas X feat Billy Ray Cyrus, Old Town Road (Remix)</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>Love it, hate it, or even love to hate it, you can&rsquo;t deny the song&rsquo;s domination in 2019. We all know the story: A $30 YouTube beat, a Nine Inch Nails sample, a viral moment on TikTok that turned into a controversy about whether or not the song could be classified as country music, and the genius move of adding Billy Ray Cyrus to the remix. It should never have worked, but it did.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;Ridin' on a horse, ha/ You can whip your Porsche/ I been in the valley/ You ain&rsquo;t been up off that porch, now.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>2. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaCrQL_8eMY\"><strong><em>Lizzo, Juice</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwwf\"}}</p><p>A riot of retro-funk filled with soul and sexiness, Lizzo gives Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars a joyous run for their money with this hit. Juice is Lizzo&rsquo;s finest feeling-good-about-yourself song to date. Along the way, Lizzo praises the woman in the mirror, sips Grey Goose and makes fun of a man sliding into her DMs.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;I be drippin&rsquo; so much sauce/ Got a bitch lookin&rsquo; like Rag&ugrave;.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI\"><strong><em>Billie Eilish, bad guy</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwxk\"}}</p><p>Of all the songs that propelled the remarkable rise of the 17-year-old pop prodigy this year, bad guy was the biggest and most subversive, and was the song that eventually toppled Old Town Road from the number 1 spot. Someone is taunted for being a bad guy, before flipping the tables to suggest that she&rsquo;s the real culprit. Thumbing a nose at the way people present themselves, the song has it all: Lo-fi swagger, sass in spades, and a surreal music video that <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/billie-eilish-bad-guy-music-video-memes/\">got the meme treatment</a> online. The dark side had never felt more fun.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Duh.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>The Essential List</em></a><em>.

In 2018, the only one of its best album nominees not to play one of their songs live was the only woman up for the prize &ndash; Lorde. The same year, U2 were featured no less than three times during the broadcast, despite not even being up for an award. The awards consistently overlooked dance music, only creating a category for it in 1998, a decade since the heyday of dance culture. And the less said about the Grammy&rsquo;s arm&rsquo;s length relationship with hip-hop the better.</p><p>The awards&rsquo; sometimes dizzying list of categories &ndash; which currently stands at 78, having been cut from 109 in 2012 &ndash; means artists in all sorts of less high-profile genres (jazz, comedy, children&rsquo;s) get their nods alongside the usual red-carpet favourites. For instance, Elmo the Muppet has won a Grammy three times &ndash; for Best Musical Album for Children in 1998 (Elmopalooza!), 1999 (The Adventures Of Elmo In Grouchland), and 2001 (Elmo And The Orchestra).</p><p>But at the heart of the Grammy conundrum is often a dilemma &ndash; whether to recognise the uncompromisingly artistic, or plump for the safer bet. No category bears that out better than Album of the Year. This time round, the panel seems to have done a decent job, balancing the pop likes of Arianna Grande and Billie Eilish with critical darlings such as Bon Iver and Lana Del Ray. But BBC Music looks at some of the times the Grammy panel got it noticeably wrong. [Note: the years cited are those in which the albums were released and were awarded for, not the year the ceremony took place, which is the following year.]</p><p><strong>1969</strong><br /> <strong>Won:&nbsp;</strong>Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears<br /> <strong>Should have won:&nbsp;</strong>The Beatles, Abbey Road<br /> Canadian jazz fusionists Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears made their first big splash with a cover of Brenda Holloway&rsquo;s You Make Me So Very Happy, So well-received, in fact, that the Grammy judges decided that the penultimate album by the most influential rock band of all time &ndash; one containing the likes of Come Together and Something &ndash; just didn&rsquo;t cut the mustard in the same way as did a jazz-tinged odyssey that included interpretations of Erik Satie and a cover of Cream&rsquo;s Sunshine Of Your Mind.</p><p><strong>1980</strong><br /> <strong>Won:&nbsp;</strong>Christopher Cross, Christopher Cross<br /> <strong>Should have won:&nbsp;</strong>AC/DC, Back In Black, or The Clash, London Calling <br /> It was a momentous year for rock, partly thanks to two phenomenal records. AC/DC reconvened after the death of their charismatic frontman Bon Scott with an emphatic call to arms. This memorial to Scott &ndash; encrypted on the leather lungs of new frontman Brian Johnson &ndash; is arguably the most popular hard rock album in history. The Clash, meantime, negotiated the revolution of punk mostly intact, and cut their masterwork, a double album which cemented their place in rock&rsquo;s pantheon &ndash; and coining a timeless anthem that will still be hummed long after London is swallowed by the Thames.</p><p>So what did the jury crown? Adult-oriented radio favourite Christopher Cross&rsquo;s self-titled debut, home of tasteful radio staples such as Sailing and Ride Like The Wind.</p><p><strong>1984</strong><br /> <strong>Won:</strong>&nbsp;Lionel Richie, Can&rsquo;t Slow Down<br /> <strong>Should have won: </strong>Bruce Springsteen, Born In The USA<br /> Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s long, steady climb from New Jersey word-of-mouth to bona fide cultural figurehead reached its high-water mark with Born In the USA, an album as inescapable in Aberdeen, Auckland and Augsburg as it was in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The toast of 1984 stadium rock might have got a nomination nod from the voting panel, but that was as far as it went. Former Commodore Lionel Richie was very much the captain of the Album of the Year category that year, for the album that featured the chart-tastic likes of Penny Lover, All Night and Hello. Or Goodbye, as it very much was for Springsteen&rsquo;s biggest album.</p><p><strong>1989</strong><br /> <strong>Won:</strong>&nbsp;Bonnie Raitt, Nick Of Time<br /> <strong>Should have won:</strong>&nbsp;Tom Petty, Full Moon Fever<br /> No disrespect to Bonnie Raitt, a Californian country legend whose Nick Of Time was a deserved breakthrough after a run of bad luck in the 1980s &ndash; not least being dropped by her record company a day after recording the album Tongue In Groove. As good as Nick Of Time was, however, it made only a small splash outside of country-lovin&rsquo; circles. The same can&rsquo;t be said for Tom Petty&rsquo;s Full Moon Fever, an album recorded by producer Jeff Lynne of ELO as the pair also contributed to the Traveling Wilburys side project. Full Moon Fever was Petty&rsquo;s first solo album, though virtually all of his band The Heartbreakers contributed. It &nbsp;included Won&rsquo;t Back Down and Free Fallin&rsquo;, two of Petty&rsquo;s biggest hits, sprinkled with Lynn&rsquo;s characteristic Beatles-esque production sheen.</p><p><strong>1992<br /> Won:</strong>&nbsp;Eric Clapton, MTV&hellip; Unplugged<br /> <strong>Should have won:</strong>&nbsp;Nirvana, Nevermind<br /> Chart pedants, relax. Yes, Nevermind was actually released in 1991, but it didn&rsquo;t go overground until the following year. The Grammys usually only rewarded slow-burning albums in the year they actually blew up, hence Nevermind being odds on for success the year later. Except&hellip; the album wasn&rsquo;t even nominated. The Grammy voting jury, in their wisdom felt Eric Clapton&rsquo;s caf&eacute;-friendly MTV&hellip; Unplugged, Annie Lennox&rsquo;s Diva and the soundtrack to Disney&rsquo;s Beauty And The Best more deserving of nods than an album that changed the way rock sounded &ndash; and looked &ndash; for a generation. As it was, Clapton won, proving that quiet was very much the new loud.</p><p><strong>1996</strong><br /> <strong>Won:</strong>&nbsp;Celine Dion, Falling Into You<br /> <strong>Should have won:</strong>&nbsp;Beck, Odelay<br /> Two years later, another ocean-going clanger. Beck&rsquo;s Odelay was rightly lauded as the album of 1996, a melange of country, folk, hip hop that grew out of largely acoustic sessions in 1994. Beck scrapped these and indeed hooked up with production duo The Dust Brothers (who had previously worked with the Beastie Boys) to produce something much more layered than his breakthrough Mellow Gold. But the ceremony showed that &ndash; once again &ndash; the Grammy voters preferred something with a little more dramatic wind in its sails. Cue Celine Dion&rsquo;s Falling Into You &ndash; the album which included Dion&rsquo;s seismograph-bothering version of Eric Carmen&rsquo;s All By Myself. Odelay, despite being nominated, sat this one out on the sidelines.</p><p><strong>1997<br /> Won:</strong>&nbsp;Bob Dylan, Time Out Of Mind<br /> <strong>Should have won: </strong>Radiohead, OK Computer<br /> In 1997, Bob Dylan revitalised a flagging muse with Time Out Of Mind, an album which saw him pairing up with producer Daniel Lanois, the Canadian who had produced U2 in the 80s and helmed Dylan&rsquo;s own Oh Mercy album in 1989. The album brought a more experimental sheen to Dylan&rsquo;s work &ndash; Lanois, after all, was massively involved in U2&rsquo;s Achtung Baby &ndash; but the generally positive reviews did include some who wondered if the record was less a Dylan masterpiece and more a demonstration of Lanois&rsquo; prowess in the studio. Radiohead, on the other hand, had released an LP widely regarded as one of the best of the decade: Pink Floyd levels of existential despair as the clock ticked closer to the end of the millennium.</p><p><strong>2000</strong><br /> <strong>Won:</strong>&nbsp;Steely Dan, Two Against Nature<br /> <strong>Should have won:&nbsp;</strong>Eminem, The Marshall Mathers LP, or Radiohead, Kid A<br /> Steely Dan were rightly lauded for their bright, smart, jazz-tinged take on pop. Much of that lauding, of course, took place in the 1970s, when the duo of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen produced their most enduring work. After 1980&rsquo;s Gaucho they called it a day for 13 years, before reuniting for concerts and, eventually, another album, 2000&rsquo;s Two Against Nature. But the album came out the same year as one of the most controversial &ndash; and best-selling &ndash; hip-hop albums of all time, Eminem&rsquo;s third album The Marshall Mathers LP.</p><p>Radiohead had also been up for contention with Kid A, a sideways swerve from the doom-laden modern prog of OK Computer into more electronic realms; it&rsquo;s today regarded as a radically successful sideways step, and a classic of the electronic genre. A classic to many, but not the Grammy voting panel, it would seem. But hey, at least they were nominated this time.</p><p><strong>2004</strong><br /> <strong>Won:</strong>&nbsp;Ray Charles and Friends, Genius Loves Company<br /> <strong>Should have won:</strong> Kanye West &ndash; The College Dropout, or Franz Ferdinand, Franz Ferdinand<br /> Steely Dan&rsquo;s win in 2000 underlines a frustrating flaw that can affect twilight career albums from established artists. In much the same way that overlooked veteran directors sometimes pick up an Oscar for lesser, later work, the Grammys can reward artists for their continued presence. It&rsquo;s also possible that the pain of losing blue legend Ray Charles &ndash; who died in June 2004 &ndash; brought Genius Loves Company into sharp relief when it was released posthumously a few months later. It was a relaxed but unspectacular duets record, pairing Charles with the likes of Willie Nelson, Norah Jones and Diana Krall.</p><p>You could argue that two classic albums of that year could have won the prize. Franz Ferdinand&rsquo;s eponymous debut was a genuine sensation, a hit record across the globe, and the perfect distillation of frontman Alex Kapranos&rsquo; desire to write songs &ldquo;your girlfriend will dance to&rdquo;, angular and interesting and yet laden with radio-friendly hooks. Kanye West&rsquo;s The College Dropout, meanwhile, remains arguably his creative zenith. Recorded over four years while West was rebuffed by record label after record label, The College Dropout fizzed with relentless energy.</p><p><strong>2007<br /> Won:&nbsp;</strong>Herbie Hancock, River: The Joni Letters<br /> <strong>Should have won:&nbsp;</strong>Amy Winehouse, Back To Black<br /> On paper, Amy Winehouse&rsquo;s defining album, Back To Black, was perfect Grammy fodder. Winehouse herself seemed beamed in from an old Hollywood movie, all heartache, beehive hairdo and eyeliner, the music shimmering in a retro haze that heightened its drama and longing. But while Winehouse did pick up Record of the Year for Rehab, the album which spawned it was overlooked for jazz-funk pioneer Herbie Hancock&rsquo;s River: The Joni Letters, an album which reimagined the songs of Joni Mitchell via a cast of collaborators including Leonard Cohen, Norah Jones, Tina Turner and Corinne Bailey Rae. A respectful tip of the hat to a living legend &ndash; but not a record that has the legacy Back To Black enjoys more than a decade later.</p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>The Essential List</em></a><em>.

The singer-songwriter, whose musical journey began after she started writing poetry, cites influences as diverse as Fela Kuti, The Doors&rsquo; Jim Morrison and poet Sylvia Plath. Songs like Sophie show almost Lorde levels of irresistible hooks, while Super Sad Generation is a quiet anthem for Extinction Rebellion times.<br /> <strong><em>Critics say:</em></strong> &ldquo;Arlo Parks&nbsp;has carved out a niche in committing to music the joyous highs and crushing lows of the emotional rollercoaster that is adolescence.&rdquo; (<em>The Guardian</em>)<br /> <strong><em>Fans say:</em></strong> &ldquo;She's from Hammersmith - same as me...

Born in LA, Celeste was three when her parents split, and she moved to the UK with her mother. She began singing around 10 years ago when she was inspired by hearing Elton John's Your Song, and wrote her first song at 16. She released an EP with Lily Allen&rsquo;s Bank Holiday Records label in 2017. The following year, Celeste signed to Polydor and toured with label-mate Michael Kiwanuka, who himself topped the BBC&rsquo;s Sound of 2012 poll. <br /> <strong><em>Critics say:</em></strong> &ldquo;Celeste is a once-in-a-generation talent.

Barnes drummed for the likes of spoken word artist Kate Tempest before releasing her own material in 2015. Now 29, this self-assured solo artist won&rsquo;t be pinned down &ndash; her material so far fizzes with energy and abandon, drawing comparisons to everyone from Massive Attack to MIA and early Bjork. She&rsquo;s already proven a hit at Glastonbury.

The only artist to have done this before him was Lewis Capaldi, who rose to number one on the Billboard chart this year. So expectations are large for the blue-eyed soul man with a lo-fi sound that melds Motown, jazz and hip-hop beats, matched with a voice that commands comparisons with Amy Winehouse and Simply Red&rsquo;s Mick Hucknall. His singles so far &ndash; all of which he wrote, played on and produced &ndash; were written in the midst of his first break up, and candidly cover the trials and tribulations of being in love.<br /> <strong><em>Critics say:</em></strong> &ldquo;At his best, he writes dreamy Al Green-inspired hooks which insinuate themselves instantly within the boudoir of your mind.&rdquo; (<em>The Scotsman</em>)<br /> <strong><em>He says:</em></strong> &ldquo;People in Glasgow can smell bullshit from afar.

Here are the tracks that topped our playlist, setting the scene for an exciting decade to come. You can listen to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6rf4M1qZUHXZD97oBpZGn8\">all 20 tracks here</a> <em>(Warning: Contains some language that may offend)</em></p><p><strong><em>20. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbcLcSY2au4\"><strong><em>Megan Thee Stallion, Hot Girl Summer</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwr6\"}}</p><p>The meme that turned into a movement; the song was an unapologetic call to have a good time and not give a flying flamingo about what anybody thinks. Everyone from Wendy&rsquo;s to Maybelline co-opted the phrase to such a degree that the artist eventually trademarked the phrase. Collaborating with Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla $ign on the track was a massive poke in the eye for anyone still thinking only one rap queen can reign supreme.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Handle me? Who gon&rsquo; handle me?/ Thinkin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s a player, he&rsquo;s a member on the team.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>19. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIcVwH47uxQ\"><strong><em>Big Thief, Not</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>The Brooklyn-based band have always won praise for finding majesty in the minutiae, and 2019 was a landmark year with two albums (UFOF and Two Hands). The top track was the lead single on the latter album, pain piercing through every one of singer/songwriter Adrianne Lenker&rsquo;s razor-sharp words. The guitar solo, or more accurately a guitar roar, is worthy of Neil Young at his peak.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the open weaving/ Nor the furnace glow/ Nor the blood of you bleeding/ As you try to let go.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>18. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84\"><strong><em>FKA twigs, Cellophane</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwrl\"}}</p><p>The British singer/songwriter&rsquo;s breathtaking, hypnotic return after three years. Stripped down to a piano-led arrangement, this tale of a relationship souring despite giving your all drew obvious parallels to the artist&rsquo;s public break up with Robert Pattinson. The fearless fragility of twigs&rsquo;s voice made heartbreak sound like being raised to the skies before crashing down to earth.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;I try but I get overwhelmed/ When you're gone, I have no one to tell.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>17. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6giKIu5jUvA\"><strong><em>Solange, Almeda</em></strong></a><br /> The sound of black pride in 2019. Solange presented a freeze frame of the area of Houston she grew up in while reciting a list of beautiful things (&ldquo;brown face, black skin, black braids, black waves&rdquo;). Playboi Carti and The-Dream joined the celebration, adding weight and joy to the mood. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;These are black-owned things/ Black faith still can&rsquo;t be washed away/ Not even in that Florida water.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>16. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZsNnuaUSNs\"><strong><em>slowthai, Nothing Great About Britain</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwrz\"}}</p><p>A snarling, pessimistic portrait of Britain from the street &ndash; covering Brexit, class warfare, and widening inequality &ndash; but told with bluntness, wit and wordplay. slowthai makes a mockery of Britishness, but he also celebrates his country, in part through the clear doffing of his cap to a host of musical influences, including Sex Pistols, The Streets and Dizzee Rascal.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I will treat you with the utmost respect only if you respect me a little bit, Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>15. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvNqNgHAEys\"><strong><em>Holly Herndon, Frontier</em></strong></a><br /> Herndon&rsquo;s third album, Proto, saw her collaborating with vocal performers and the digital voice of an AI program called Spawn. One of its most stunning and human moments came on Frontier. Inspired by Appalachian Sacred Harp singing, a single voice builds to a vocal crescendo that blurs the difference between human and machine in ways that feel comfortable, disorientating and heart-warming all at once.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;This earth doesn't care for what we need, what we breathe/ A frontier of green or of dust.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>14. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yljWf3_flbM\"><strong><em>The Highwomen, If She Ever Leaves Me</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwt4\"}}</p><p>It was billed as the first gay country song, which isn&rsquo;t strictly speaking true, but the lead track from the all-female supergroup is certainly the most high-profile one to date. Brandi Carlile subverts country ballad tradition, sending a warning to a male cowboy who has an eye on her female partner, which also felt like a welcome rejoinder to the machismo that can pervade the genre. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em>&ldquo;</strong>If she ever gives her careful heart to somebody new, well, it won&rsquo;t be for a cowboy like you.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>13. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCuhuePlP8o\"><strong><em>Lewis Capaldi, Someone You Loved</em></strong></a><br /> Scottish singer-songwriter Capaldi became the somewhat improbable break-out star of the year. His album Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent was the fastest-selling UK album of the year. And Someone You Loved topped both the UK and US singles chart &ndash; its straightforward tale about a break-up and Capaldi&rsquo;s raspy soulful voice capturing the imagination of a vast swathe of lovelorn fans.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>12. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSSKDIcpdSE\"><strong><em>Little Simz, Selfish</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwtc\"}}</p><p>It may have been a long time coming, but the London rapper is finally achieving the success that has been predicted by everyone from Kendrick Lamar to Forbes magazine. So, it&rsquo;s perhaps appropriate that it came in the slicker sound and form of Selfish. Haters are always going to hate, the rapper defiantly states, but no-one can question what she&rsquo;s earned through her own hard graft and creativity. And who are we to argue?<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;No validation, no applause/ You don&rsquo;t have to prove you got it when you know it&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>11. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDUPSNdmFew\"><strong><em>Dave, Black</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>From the groundbreaking Mercury Prize-winning album came a track that was a laser-sharp examination of contemporary racism and racial identity. The south London rapper tackles colonialism, social mobility and media coverage, but like Solange, the song is also peppered with pride about his blackness. UK listeners complained when it appeared on the Radio 1 playlist, but DJ Annie Mac replied: &ldquo;If you are genuinely offended by a man talking about the colour of his skin and how it has shaped his identity then that is a problem for you.&rdquo;<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;A kid dies, the blacker the killer, the sweeter the news/ And if he's white you give him a chance, he&rsquo;s ill and confused.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>10. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chSZCtLrgz8\"><strong><em>Charli XCX &ndash; Gone (feat Christine and the Queens)</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwtv\"}}</p><p>Sometimes a partnership makes more sense on paper than in the studio, sometimes it more than delivers on the promise. Gone is firmly in the latter camp, the two pop mavericks creating an uncompromising, existential anti-social anthem. It&rsquo;s a collaborative cri de coeur about the weight of expectation, with the unrelenting electro-funk beat providing the perfect soundtrack to their catharsis. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Am I a smoke? Am I the sun? Who decides?&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>9. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmAsUQEFYGI\"><strong><em>Tyler, The Creator, Earfquake</em></strong></a><br /> Originally written with Justin Beiber in mind, and later offered to and rejected by Rhianna, Earfquake finds the rapper singing in heartbreak mode, pleading a lover not to leave over summer sounds and harmonies. His trademark sound is boosted by vocals from R&amp;B legend Charlie Wilson, Devont&eacute; Hyne and (as it turns out, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/1142152753474617344/photo/1\">untranscribable</a>) ad-libs from Playboi Carti.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;You don't want no complication, no/ I don't want no side information/ I just need to know what's happening/ 'cause I'm for real.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>8. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7sTHoeH0eA\"><strong><em>Sharon Van Etten, Seventeen</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwv7\"}}</p><p>A self-declared love letter to New York, Seventeen is up there amongst Van Etten&rsquo;s finest work. It&rsquo;s for anyone who has ever peered back into their past and worried whether or not age has improved them. With Van Etten you don&rsquo;t quite know the answer, but let&rsquo;s face it that&rsquo;s life, and Van Etten brilliantly captures the scrambled, jumbled emotions between nostalgia and hindsight.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re gonna be/You&rsquo;ll crumple it up just to see/Afraid that you&rsquo;ll be just like me!&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>7. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlkTVMMkCP4\"><strong><em>Vampire Weekend, Harmony Hall</em></strong></a><br /> A track that&rsquo;s the equivalent of opening the curtains and letting the spring sun shine in, Harmony Hall sees the band subtly refining their sound, with Ezra Koenig&rsquo;s most poignant and accessible lyrics to date. If you like the acoustic guitar riff, rejoice, there&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5926&amp;v=qa1t5bjJbms\">two hours-worth of it here</a>.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Anger wants a voice/ Voices wanna sing/ Singers harmonize/ &lsquo;Til they can&rsquo;t hear anything.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>6. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F9jesjJMz0\"><strong><em>Lana Del Rey, The greatest</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwvp\"}}</p><p>A comedown anthem for the burned-out generation. Del Rey focused her swooning cinematic style on the American Dream, or what she thinks is left of it. The Greatest takes a sombre and elegiac view of a country swamped by political anxiety, climate change, celebrity culture, and even the false alarm of a nuclear attack on Hawaii. The apocalypse may not be now, but in Del Rey&rsquo;s hands it feels both horrifying and beautiful.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;The culture is lit and I had a ball/ I guess that I'm burned out after all.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>5. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7bfOZek9t4\"><strong><em>Rosal&iacute;a feat J Balvin &amp; El Guincho, Con Altura</em></strong></a><br /> Rosal&iacute;a has been making waves with her contemporary take on flamenco, but this is the song that put her on the international map. An effortless fusion of traditional music with old-school reggaet&oacute;n and a dash of Middle-Eastern inspiration, Rosal&iacute;a created a sound all of her own &ndash; a sound that feels a lot like the future of global pop music.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;Vivo r&aacute;pido y no tengo cura/ Ir&eacute; joven pa&rsquo; la sepulture.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>4. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9HYJbe9Y18\"><strong><em>Clairo, Bags</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwvz\"}}</p><p>Breaking up is hard to do, and sometimes even harder to explain. The lead Rostam Batmanglij-produced single from Clairo&rsquo;s album Immunity, achingly explores the kind of insignificant, unspoken things that accumulate and coalesce into the moment when a loved one walks out the door with those bags. Low-key, touching and heart-felt, the song elevated the 21-year-old from You Tube phenomenon to bona fide pop star. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Can you see me? I&rsquo;m waiting for the right time / I can&rsquo;t read you, but if you want, the pleasure&rsquo;s all mine.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>3. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ysFgElQtjI\"><strong><em>Lil Nas X feat Billy Ray Cyrus, Old Town Road (Remix)</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>Love it, hate it, or even love to hate it, you can&rsquo;t deny the song&rsquo;s domination in 2019. We all know the story: A $30 YouTube beat, a Nine Inch Nails sample, a viral moment on TikTok that turned into a controversy about whether or not the song could be classified as country music, and the genius move of adding Billy Ray Cyrus to the remix. It should never have worked, but it did.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;Ridin' on a horse, ha/ You can whip your Porsche/ I been in the valley/ You ain&rsquo;t been up off that porch, now.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>2. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaCrQL_8eMY\"><strong><em>Lizzo, Juice</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwwf\"}}</p><p>A riot of retro-funk filled with soul and sexiness, Lizzo gives Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars a joyous run for their money with this hit. Juice is Lizzo&rsquo;s finest feeling-good-about-yourself song to date. Along the way, Lizzo praises the woman in the mirror, sips Grey Goose and makes fun of a man sliding into her DMs.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;I be drippin&rsquo; so much sauce/ Got a bitch lookin&rsquo; like Rag&ugrave;.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI\"><strong><em>Billie Eilish, bad guy</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwxk\"}}</p><p>Of all the songs that propelled the remarkable rise of the 17-year-old pop prodigy this year, bad guy was the biggest and most subversive, and was the song that eventually toppled Old Town Road from the number 1 spot. Someone is taunted for being a bad guy, before flipping the tables to suggest that she&rsquo;s the real culprit. Thumbing a nose at the way people present themselves, the song has it all: Lo-fi swagger, sass in spades, and a surreal music video that <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/billie-eilish-bad-guy-music-video-memes/\">got the meme treatment</a> online. The dark side had never felt more fun.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Duh.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>The Essential List</em></a><em>.

The neo-soul singer has earned feverish comparisons with Amy Winehouse and Billie Holiday for her bluesy melancholic voice. Celeste started her journey with BBC Music in 2014 when she uploaded her track North Circular to the BBC Music Introducing website. Her heartbreaking single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrUPfAbMFio\">Strange</a> put her on the map, and she has toured with label-mate Michael Kiwanuka, who topped the BBC&rsquo;s Sound of 2012 poll. One of her biggest fans is Paul Weller. &ldquo;He reached out to one of my managers, we got to do <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUPsKZfuXi8\">a duet of one of his songs</a>,&rdquo; Celeste tells the BBC. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect that sort of thing to happen.&rdquo; Another fan is James Corden, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JKCorden/status/1189788247066497024\">who tweeted</a>:&ldquo;I cannot stop listening to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/celeste\">@celeste</a> this is her song Strange.

The band say they were formed &ldquo;on a whim&rdquo; in a pub two years ago, and their first single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeFq3Sta6bY\">Pockets</a> picked up a huge amount of buzz almost immediately. &ldquo;Pockets is four-and-a-half minutes long and it&rsquo;s not very commercial, but ironically it was that song that got a moderate commercial seal of approval,&rdquo; says frontman Murray Matravers. &ldquo;That was a massive deal for us, because we were just five dudes from Leicester rehearsing on an industrial estate.&rdquo; Their music is enshrouded with personal experience, but with a distinctly rainy British outlook. &ldquo;The overarching thing is the idea that life can get a bit crap, but everything&rsquo;s going to be OK,&rdquo; Matravers tells the BBC. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a British outlook to grit your teeth and smile &ndash; but I can't help it, that&rsquo;s my general outlook.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>THIRD PLACE: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yungblud/\">Yungblud</a></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07znd2z\"}}</p><p>Yorkshire&rsquo;s Yungblud is the most established artist on the list: he has more Spotify streams than the other nine artists on the longlist combined, and his EP <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0kGTcfwQC5nlsubgxUXdwP?autoplay=true&amp;v=L\">The Underrated Youth</a> reached the UK&rsquo;s top 10. His ambitions are to make anthems that speak to his own generation, and his unflinching honesty about his sexuality and ADHD has won him a host of loyal fans worldwide - who call themselves The Black Hearts Club, based on the two tattoos on his middle fingers. Yungblud wears his heart on his androgynously dressed sleeve about topics like sexual assault, gun control and mental health, and he&rsquo;s worked with Marshmello, dated Halsey, and <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/yungblud-teases-collaboration-with-post-malone-2593263\">current rumours</a> suggest a collaboration with Post Malone may be in the pipeline. &ldquo;People are angry again, people are riled up and want to be told the truth,&rdquo; he tells the BBC. &ldquo;When people look back on us in 10 years, I want them to be like, &lsquo;They were a movement and they did something that was that was completely original and a liberation within people&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>FOURTH PLACE: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joycrookes/\">Joy Crookes</a></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07zmj7c\"}}</p><p>Born to a Bangladeshi mother and an Irish father, Joy Crookes&rsquo; jazz-drenched vocals and honest, witty lyrics paint vivid portraits of everything from her identity to life in London.

Her sound fuses the eclectic range of music her father played as he drove her to her weekly Irish dancing lessons. &ldquo;My dad wanted to give me a real education, from Nick Cave to King Tubby to all this Pakistani music,&rdquo; Crookes tells the BBC. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;This is from your ends of the world, you should hear this.&rsquo;&rdquo; Not that Crookes is fully embracing the attention that being on the Sound of 2020 list will bring. &ldquo;Anxiety central is what it feels like!&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s half an incredible feeling because there&rsquo;s so much adrenaline, but the other half is like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to die, I&rsquo;m going to die, I&rsquo;m going to die!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p><strong>FIFTH PLACE: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/inhalerdublin/?hl=en\">Inhaler</a></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07zfhjb\"}}</p><p>Having Bono&rsquo;s son in the band is always going to open a few doors for you, but rather than trade on his dad&rsquo;s name, Elijah Hewson and schoolfriend band members Robert Keating, Ryan McMahon and Josh Jenkinson have done their apprenticeship the harder way. The band have crafted a post-punk sound influenced by Joy Division, The Strokes, The Stone Roses and The Cure, and taken it to tiny pubs and clubs to build up a loyal following. They&rsquo;ve supported Noel Gallagher and recently finished their first US tour, supporting Blossoms. The proto-stadium rock of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAP4B1G-SWk\">My Honest Face</a> is their stand-out song so far, and the band say their debut album will be about their generation's dependence on smartphones and social media.

As for the sound, even the band will admit that it&rsquo;s eclectic, thanks to formative years spent in swing and reggae bands. <br /> <strong><em>Critics say:</em></strong> &ldquo;Coating bittersweet lyrics dissecting everyday life struggles with a hip-hop-meets-indie veneer, then mixing it in with a slacker rock attitude, their music sounds like what it feels like to just sit back and go with the flow.&rdquo; (<em>DIY Mag</em>)<br /> <strong><em>They say: </em></strong>&ldquo;It feels like there&rsquo;s no genre for us.

Everyone from Wendy&rsquo;s to Maybelline co-opted the phrase to such a degree that the artist eventually trademarked the phrase. Collaborating with Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla $ign on the track was a massive poke in the eye for anyone still thinking only one rap queen can reign supreme.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Handle me? Who gon&rsquo; handle me?/ Thinkin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s a player, he&rsquo;s a member on the team.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>19. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIcVwH47uxQ\"><strong><em>Big Thief, Not</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>The Brooklyn-based band have always won praise for finding majesty in the minutiae, and 2019 was a landmark year with two albums (UFOF and Two Hands). The top track was the lead single on the latter album, pain piercing through every one of singer/songwriter Adrianne Lenker&rsquo;s razor-sharp words. The guitar solo, or more accurately a guitar roar, is worthy of Neil Young at his peak.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the open weaving/ Nor the furnace glow/ Nor the blood of you bleeding/ As you try to let go.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>18. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84\"><strong><em>FKA twigs, Cellophane</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwrl\"}}</p><p>The British singer/songwriter&rsquo;s breathtaking, hypnotic return after three years. Stripped down to a piano-led arrangement, this tale of a relationship souring despite giving your all drew obvious parallels to the artist&rsquo;s public break up with Robert Pattinson. The fearless fragility of twigs&rsquo;s voice made heartbreak sound like being raised to the skies before crashing down to earth.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;I try but I get overwhelmed/ When you're gone, I have no one to tell.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>17. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6giKIu5jUvA\"><strong><em>Solange, Almeda</em></strong></a><br /> The sound of black pride in 2019. Solange presented a freeze frame of the area of Houston she grew up in while reciting a list of beautiful things (&ldquo;brown face, black skin, black braids, black waves&rdquo;). Playboi Carti and The-Dream joined the celebration, adding weight and joy to the mood. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;These are black-owned things/ Black faith still can&rsquo;t be washed away/ Not even in that Florida water.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>16. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZsNnuaUSNs\"><strong><em>slowthai, Nothing Great About Britain</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwrz\"}}</p><p>A snarling, pessimistic portrait of Britain from the street &ndash; covering Brexit, class warfare, and widening inequality &ndash; but told with bluntness, wit and wordplay. slowthai makes a mockery of Britishness, but he also celebrates his country, in part through the clear doffing of his cap to a host of musical influences, including Sex Pistols, The Streets and Dizzee Rascal.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I will treat you with the utmost respect only if you respect me a little bit, Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>15. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvNqNgHAEys\"><strong><em>Holly Herndon, Frontier</em></strong></a><br /> Herndon&rsquo;s third album, Proto, saw her collaborating with vocal performers and the digital voice of an AI program called Spawn. One of its most stunning and human moments came on Frontier. Inspired by Appalachian Sacred Harp singing, a single voice builds to a vocal crescendo that blurs the difference between human and machine in ways that feel comfortable, disorientating and heart-warming all at once.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;This earth doesn't care for what we need, what we breathe/ A frontier of green or of dust.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>14. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yljWf3_flbM\"><strong><em>The Highwomen, If She Ever Leaves Me</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwt4\"}}</p><p>It was billed as the first gay country song, which isn&rsquo;t strictly speaking true, but the lead track from the all-female supergroup is certainly the most high-profile one to date. Brandi Carlile subverts country ballad tradition, sending a warning to a male cowboy who has an eye on her female partner, which also felt like a welcome rejoinder to the machismo that can pervade the genre. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em>&ldquo;</strong>If she ever gives her careful heart to somebody new, well, it won&rsquo;t be for a cowboy like you.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>13. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCuhuePlP8o\"><strong><em>Lewis Capaldi, Someone You Loved</em></strong></a><br /> Scottish singer-songwriter Capaldi became the somewhat improbable break-out star of the year. His album Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent was the fastest-selling UK album of the year. And Someone You Loved topped both the UK and US singles chart &ndash; its straightforward tale about a break-up and Capaldi&rsquo;s raspy soulful voice capturing the imagination of a vast swathe of lovelorn fans.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>12. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSSKDIcpdSE\"><strong><em>Little Simz, Selfish</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwtc\"}}</p><p>It may have been a long time coming, but the London rapper is finally achieving the success that has been predicted by everyone from Kendrick Lamar to Forbes magazine. So, it&rsquo;s perhaps appropriate that it came in the slicker sound and form of Selfish. Haters are always going to hate, the rapper defiantly states, but no-one can question what she&rsquo;s earned through her own hard graft and creativity. And who are we to argue?<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;No validation, no applause/ You don&rsquo;t have to prove you got it when you know it&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>11. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDUPSNdmFew\"><strong><em>Dave, Black</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>From the groundbreaking Mercury Prize-winning album came a track that was a laser-sharp examination of contemporary racism and racial identity. The south London rapper tackles colonialism, social mobility and media coverage, but like Solange, the song is also peppered with pride about his blackness. UK listeners complained when it appeared on the Radio 1 playlist, but DJ Annie Mac replied: &ldquo;If you are genuinely offended by a man talking about the colour of his skin and how it has shaped his identity then that is a problem for you.&rdquo;<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;A kid dies, the blacker the killer, the sweeter the news/ And if he's white you give him a chance, he&rsquo;s ill and confused.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>10. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chSZCtLrgz8\"><strong><em>Charli XCX &ndash; Gone (feat Christine and the Queens)</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwtv\"}}</p><p>Sometimes a partnership makes more sense on paper than in the studio, sometimes it more than delivers on the promise. Gone is firmly in the latter camp, the two pop mavericks creating an uncompromising, existential anti-social anthem. It&rsquo;s a collaborative cri de coeur about the weight of expectation, with the unrelenting electro-funk beat providing the perfect soundtrack to their catharsis. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Am I a smoke? Am I the sun? Who decides?&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>9. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmAsUQEFYGI\"><strong><em>Tyler, The Creator, Earfquake</em></strong></a><br /> Originally written with Justin Beiber in mind, and later offered to and rejected by Rhianna, Earfquake finds the rapper singing in heartbreak mode, pleading a lover not to leave over summer sounds and harmonies. His trademark sound is boosted by vocals from R&amp;B legend Charlie Wilson, Devont&eacute; Hyne and (as it turns out, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/1142152753474617344/photo/1\">untranscribable</a>) ad-libs from Playboi Carti.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;You don't want no complication, no/ I don't want no side information/ I just need to know what's happening/ 'cause I'm for real.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>8. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7sTHoeH0eA\"><strong><em>Sharon Van Etten, Seventeen</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwv7\"}}</p><p>A self-declared love letter to New York, Seventeen is up there amongst Van Etten&rsquo;s finest work. It&rsquo;s for anyone who has ever peered back into their past and worried whether or not age has improved them. With Van Etten you don&rsquo;t quite know the answer, but let&rsquo;s face it that&rsquo;s life, and Van Etten brilliantly captures the scrambled, jumbled emotions between nostalgia and hindsight.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re gonna be/You&rsquo;ll crumple it up just to see/Afraid that you&rsquo;ll be just like me!&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>7. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlkTVMMkCP4\"><strong><em>Vampire Weekend, Harmony Hall</em></strong></a><br /> A track that&rsquo;s the equivalent of opening the curtains and letting the spring sun shine in, Harmony Hall sees the band subtly refining their sound, with Ezra Koenig&rsquo;s most poignant and accessible lyrics to date. If you like the acoustic guitar riff, rejoice, there&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5926&amp;v=qa1t5bjJbms\">two hours-worth of it here</a>.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Anger wants a voice/ Voices wanna sing/ Singers harmonize/ &lsquo;Til they can&rsquo;t hear anything.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>6. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F9jesjJMz0\"><strong><em>Lana Del Rey, The greatest</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwvp\"}}</p><p>A comedown anthem for the burned-out generation. Del Rey focused her swooning cinematic style on the American Dream, or what she thinks is left of it. The Greatest takes a sombre and elegiac view of a country swamped by political anxiety, climate change, celebrity culture, and even the false alarm of a nuclear attack on Hawaii. The apocalypse may not be now, but in Del Rey&rsquo;s hands it feels both horrifying and beautiful.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;The culture is lit and I had a ball/ I guess that I'm burned out after all.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>5. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7bfOZek9t4\"><strong><em>Rosal&iacute;a feat J Balvin &amp; El Guincho, Con Altura</em></strong></a><br /> Rosal&iacute;a has been making waves with her contemporary take on flamenco, but this is the song that put her on the international map. An effortless fusion of traditional music with old-school reggaet&oacute;n and a dash of Middle-Eastern inspiration, Rosal&iacute;a created a sound all of her own &ndash; a sound that feels a lot like the future of global pop music.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;Vivo r&aacute;pido y no tengo cura/ Ir&eacute; joven pa&rsquo; la sepulture.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>4. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9HYJbe9Y18\"><strong><em>Clairo, Bags</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwvz\"}}</p><p>Breaking up is hard to do, and sometimes even harder to explain. The lead Rostam Batmanglij-produced single from Clairo&rsquo;s album Immunity, achingly explores the kind of insignificant, unspoken things that accumulate and coalesce into the moment when a loved one walks out the door with those bags. Low-key, touching and heart-felt, the song elevated the 21-year-old from You Tube phenomenon to bona fide pop star. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Can you see me? I&rsquo;m waiting for the right time / I can&rsquo;t read you, but if you want, the pleasure&rsquo;s all mine.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>3. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ysFgElQtjI\"><strong><em>Lil Nas X feat Billy Ray Cyrus, Old Town Road (Remix)</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>Love it, hate it, or even love to hate it, you can&rsquo;t deny the song&rsquo;s domination in 2019. We all know the story: A $30 YouTube beat, a Nine Inch Nails sample, a viral moment on TikTok that turned into a controversy about whether or not the song could be classified as country music, and the genius move of adding Billy Ray Cyrus to the remix. It should never have worked, but it did.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;Ridin' on a horse, ha/ You can whip your Porsche/ I been in the valley/ You ain&rsquo;t been up off that porch, now.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>2. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaCrQL_8eMY\"><strong><em>Lizzo, Juice</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwwf\"}}</p><p>A riot of retro-funk filled with soul and sexiness, Lizzo gives Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars a joyous run for their money with this hit. Juice is Lizzo&rsquo;s finest feeling-good-about-yourself song to date. Along the way, Lizzo praises the woman in the mirror, sips Grey Goose and makes fun of a man sliding into her DMs.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;I be drippin&rsquo; so much sauce/ Got a bitch lookin&rsquo; like Rag&ugrave;.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI\"><strong><em>Billie Eilish, bad guy</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwxk\"}}</p><p>Of all the songs that propelled the remarkable rise of the 17-year-old pop prodigy this year, bad guy was the biggest and most subversive, and was the song that eventually toppled Old Town Road from the number 1 spot. Someone is taunted for being a bad guy, before flipping the tables to suggest that she&rsquo;s the real culprit. Thumbing a nose at the way people present themselves, the song has it all: Lo-fi swagger, sass in spades, and a surreal music video that <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/billie-eilish-bad-guy-music-video-memes/\">got the meme treatment</a> online. The dark side had never felt more fun.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Duh.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>The Essential List</em></a><em>.

decades in popular music have been defined by genres, formats or geographies, but the 2010s can be perhaps best defined by platforms. Spotify launched in the US, as well as Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music and a Jay-Z-rebranded Tidal, and streaming figures became included in the singles and album charts. Social media broke down walls by creating direct lines of communication between artists and fans, with followers, memes and challenges on YouTube, Instagram and more recently TikTok becoming a crucial window for both fans and A&amp;R departments.</p><p>As a result, it was a time in which music became truly global, and genres seemed to mutate and fuse. Latin and K-pop became established as major genres, EDM entered the mainstream. Hip-hop was elevated to a new level, outselling rock music for the first time, and saw subgenres like trap and SoundCloud rap acheiving mainstream success. The 2010s was also bookended by two young female artists &ndash; Adele and Billie Eilish &ndash; who in their own way personified the present and future of popular music.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s our year-by-year guide to the songs we think perhaps best defined the 2010s. These aren&rsquo;t necessarily our favourite songs, or the best-selling songs, but the songs that helped define the soundtrack to the last 10 years. Listen to all the picks on our <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1am1xJwhCyqe5t730Lv5ip\" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7sKYsVBRr16OzLnYFqD8JM?si=bR44Pq4TQ3OKplY-opSrgg\">Spotify playlist here</a>.</p><p><strong>2010<br /> A-side: Adele, Rolling in the Deep</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6v7j\"}}</p><p>Apparently, Adele's 21 or 19 albums were so popular in the UK that at one stage a copy was sold every 7 seconds. Given how quickly this song became inescapable &ndash; blaring out from wine bars, TVs, and the rolled-up windows of countless school runs &ndash; it&rsquo;s remarkable just how odd Adele&rsquo;s Rolling In The Deep is. A four-to-the-floor broadside from a woman scorned, the song unleashed a Delta Blues howl that the young Brit had barely hinted at, and that propelled her to the top of the charts worldwide. But it&rsquo;s the backing vocals that elevate this to something extraordinary &ndash; cold and judgemental, where you might have expected warmth and heartfelt harmony. It&rsquo;s a masterpiece of subverting a classic, timeless form.</p><p><strong>B-side: Robyn, Dancing On My Own<br /> </strong>One of the decade&rsquo;s great disco bangers, this has remained a high mark in Robyn&rsquo;s career so far. The first of her songs to top the charts in her native Sweden, the song was a bittersweet, voyeuristic narrative, a woman dancing alone in a crowded club while her ex and his new lover look on. It may have sounded, on the surface, life-affirming, but this was bleak, wounded pop of the highest order, and set the template for a certain brand of female empowerment through angst for the rest of the decade.</p><p><strong>2011<br /> A-side: Lana Del Rey, Video Games</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwvp\"}}</p><p>Lizzy Grant was dead. Long live Lana Del Ray. Grant had played New York clubs for years under her own name, releasing a single album that sank without trace. A name change signalled a Year Zero. Out went casual clothes and a shy onstage persona &ndash; in came widescreen Sixties drama, dressed up like a glamorous gangster&rsquo;s wife on the brink of a biblical fall. For all the accusations of artifice and manufacturing (Del Ray was accused of being a record company puppet), this homage to a sordid, swinging 60s was feverishly cinematic.</p><p><strong>B-side: Rebecca Black, Friday<br /> </strong>Self-recorded tracks existed long before the internet &ndash; in the 1950s, you could have your own records pressed after warbling to your heart&rsquo;s content inside a vocal booth (Elvis Presley was signed after doing just that at Sun Records in Memphis in the 1950s). Rebecca Black only updated the tradition for the social media age. For the princely sum of $4,000, Black&rsquo;s parents created an unwitting, auto-tuned popstar, a 13-year-old girl whose beyond-innocent tribute to the end of the week went viral &ndash; more than 167 million views on YouTube in the first four months alone. The other side of social media success reared its ugly head too: Black faced an onslaught of cyberbullying with people calling it &ldquo;the worst song ever&rdquo; and creating a seemingly never-ending series of parodies.</p><p><strong>2012<br /> A-side: Psy, Gangnam Style</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6vnx\"}}</p><p>In Korean, it means &ldquo;south of the river&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s regarded as the South Korean Beverley Hills, and home to some of the world&rsquo;s priciest real estate. It even hosted the G:20 conference in 2011. But this isn&rsquo;t why you know Gangnam. In 2012, Korean rapper Psy made this affluent stretch of Seoul as well-known to pop music as London, New York, Paris, Munich. The first globe-swallowing K-pop hit, Gangnam Style made Psy &ndash; the antithesis of the chiselled, good looking K-pop pin-up &ndash; into a viral star the world over. Let&rsquo;s face it, you can still do the dance.</p><p><strong>B-side: Lorde, Royals<br /> </strong>Global popstars &ndash; with apologies to one Neil Finn &ndash; don&rsquo;t tend to come from New Zealand. That all changed with the arrival of Lorde, a teenage singer-songwriter whose development had been nurtured by a local A&amp;R since she was 12. Though the song would become a worldwide hit in 2013, it first emerged &ndash; free to download &ndash; on SoundCloud towards the end of 2012. It was the 17-year-old&rsquo;s reaction to seeing conspicuous consumption in hip-hop videos and hearing a laundry list of luxury brands on rap songs, a realisation that the world you&rsquo;re being sold is make believe. It&rsquo;s minimal production created the blueprint for the &ldquo;cutting-edge&rdquo; sound of pop, and set the scene for other global successes like Taylor Swift blockbuster <em>1989</em> album.</p><p><strong>2013<br /> A-side: Daft Punk, Get Lucky ft Pharrell Williams, Nile Rodgers<br /></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6w2f\"}}</p><p>Before Get Lucky, Daft Punk had had a relatively quiet decade &ndash; their 2005 album Human After All attracted lacklustre reviews after the well-received Discovery (2001). The duo put their robotic heads down and toured for a couple of years&hellip; and then went silent. It was only in 2013 that a new song appeared. Daft Punk had met former Chic legend Nile Rodgers at a listening party in 1997, and more than a decade-and-a-half later, Rodgers would be instrumental in making their disco-flavoured Get Lucky the song of the summer. It&rsquo;s not just down to Rodgers, either &ndash; Get Lucky&rsquo;s sinuous melodies are ever sweeter thanks to the vocals of Pharrell Williams, who had quite the year&hellip;</p><p><strong>B-side: Robin Thicke, Blurred Lines ft. TI + Pharrell<br /> </strong>A song made famous thanks to 1) a video which left little to the imagination and 2) a court case involving the mischievous lifting of one of Marvin Gaye&rsquo;s most irresistible hooks. Robin Thicke&rsquo;s song was one of three massive hits featuring Pharrell that year (see also Get Lucky and the Despicable Me 2-featured super smash Happy). The topless version of the video for Blurred Lines was removed from YouTube after only a week but it only served to add to the song&rsquo;s lustre. The line &ldquo;I know you want it&rdquo; only served to cause further issue as the #MeToo movement began to grow, causing it to be banned at student discos in the UK. Worse for Thicke and Williams was to come, when Marvin Gaye&rsquo;s estate sued claiming the track had pilfered from the club classic Got To Get It On. The case went to trial and in 2015 the pair were found guilty of copyright infringement by a jury in 2015; the song had not sampled Gaye&rsquo;s tune, but was found to have copied the feel of it &ndash; a seismic change in copyright claims which has huge implications for the industry.</p><p><strong>2014<br /> A-side: Mark Ronson, Uptown Funk ft. Bruno Mars<br /></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6w8q\"}}</p><p>Ever imagined what an updated version of Was Not Was&rsquo;s Walk The Dinosaur might sound like? Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson might have pondered that very same thought. 2014&rsquo;s least subtle singalong &ndash; at some point you can probably hear the moment a kitchen sink is thrown into the mix &ndash; Uptown Funk kisses itself at its prettiness and sweeps all before it with a seemingly unstoppable escalation. It&rsquo;s as if two bands had an arms race over who could create the most worthy descendant of The Gap Band&rsquo;s Oops Upside Your Head, and this was the end result.</p><p><strong>B-side: Meghan Trainor, All About That Bass<br /> </strong>A paean to the bottom end, just not the kind of bottom end audiophiles are usually obsessed with. Trainor was not a pop star herself, but a writer for hire when she penned the track, a collaboration with Kevin Kadish that took all of 40 minutes. Borrowing some of the tropes of doo-wop (Trainor had been a fan since she was introduced to it by her father), the soca-flavoured song is a no-description-spared celebration of the fuller figure.</p><p><strong>2015<br /> A-side: BTS, I Need U</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6wbw\"}}</p><p>It&rsquo;s the pop equivalent of the Marvel Universe. When it comes to immersing their fans in a manufactured world, few bands can match the creative vision of K-pop sensations BTS. I Need U, from their second album The Most Beautiful Moment In Life Part 2, was an electro-pop sideways move for the South Korean seven-piece, and a snapshot of the wider story the band teased out over the course of the album&rsquo;s life, through music videos, social media posts, album art and comics. In due course, K-pop and BTS in particular would become a sensation not just in South East Asia but across the world.</p><p><strong>B-side: Kendrick Lamar, Alright<br /> </strong>&ldquo;We gon&rsquo; be alright.&rdquo; The simplest of choruses, turned into an anthem for a new civil rights movement. Inspired by a trip Lamar took to South Africa, the rapper fused beats provided by man-of-the-decade Pharrell with a wake-up call for black youth, recognising the struggle from generations past was still not done. It gained further credence when that five-syllable chorus became a chant at Black Lives Matter rallies. &ldquo;We gon&rsquo; be alright&rdquo; became less a throwaway optimistic catchphrase, and more than act of defiance.</p><p><strong>2016<br /> A-side: Beyonc&eacute;, Formation</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6wg9\"}}</p><p>Beyonce&rsquo;s sixth album Lemonade broke the mould when it was released with absolutely no advanced notice. The lead single Formation was an intense, uncompromising expression of both blackness and Southern-ness, the latter something Queen Bey had often been accused of forgetting by detractors. The opening verse is unequivocal, laying waste to online gossip (&ldquo;Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess&rdquo;) before unfurling a <em>different</em> kind of Southern flag a few lines later (&ldquo;My daddy Alabama / Momma Louisiana&rdquo;). The beats were insistent, almost martial; this was a Black Power anthem musically stripped back but a lyrical <em>tour de force.</em></p><p><strong>B-side: Billie Eilish, ocean eyes<br /> </strong>Eilish came out of the blocks with real intent: Ocean Eyes was her first song, written by her older brother Finneas O&rsquo;Connell, ostensibly for his band. First released on SoundCloud in November 2015, the song helped create a buzz about Eilish when she was still only 13, the lack of record company involvement making her feel like a genuine discovery. The lyrics made an instant impression, drawing parallels to Lorde: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stop staring at those ocean skies / Burning cities and napalm skies / Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes.&rdquo; By the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191220-the-20-best-songs-of-2019\">end of the decade</a>, Eilish would become one of the defining stars of pop music.</p><p><strong>2017<br /> A-side: Luis Fonsi, Despacito ft. Daddy Yankee</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6wn5\"}}</p><p>From the Amazon to the Arctic Circle, Greenland to the Galapagos, this was the song of 2017. A collaboration between Puerto Ricans Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, the song&rsquo;s remix added Justin Bieber into the mix &ndash; and made this song the biggest Latin smash since Macarena, some 20 years before. What was an otherwise inoffensive urban-inflected pop song, mostly sung in Spanish, instead became a battering ram that broke down the barriers that had kept Latino pop off English-speaking airwaves; they now call it &ldquo;the Despacito effect&rdquo;, and the likes of Demi Lovato and Camila Cabello have followed in its wake.</p><p><strong>B-side: Ed Sheeran, Shape Of You<br /> </strong>In the UK, you know you&rsquo;ve made it when your song in used in an advert for middle class supermarket Marks &amp; Spencers. Such was the ubiquity of Shape Of You. Sheeran was already big &ndash; stadium-filling big &ndash; by the time Shape Of You shimmied its sinuous hips across the world&rsquo;s speakers in 2017. Inspired by TLC&rsquo;s No Scrubs (that tune&rsquo;s writers also get a nod on the credits) the song went on to become the biggest-selling single of 2017, and in 2018 became the first track to break two billion plays on streaming service Spotify. Originally conceived as a duet between Rihanna and rap star Rudimental, the head of Sheeran&rsquo;s label convinced him to keep the track for himself.</p><p><strong>2018<br /> A-side: Childish Gambino, This Is America</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6wpc\"}}</p><p>Polymath Donald Glover (aka Childish Gambino) was starring in an episode of Saturday Night Live when the video for This Is America dropped (by then he&rsquo;s already appeared in the Star Wars spin-off Solo: A Star Wars Story). He&rsquo;d already produced a string of albums and singles, but some reviewers wondered out loud whether Glover was too busy being an actor, comedian and DJ to come up with a proper hit. Well, that changed with This Is America and its video, a film so stacked with allusions to black life in 21st Century America that it required several viewings. A visceral diatribe against American gun culture, the video is so stuffed with visual information &ndash; especially the nods to police prejudice against black Americans &ndash; it takes several views to full take in.</p><p><strong>B-side: Ariana Grande: no tears left to cry<br /> </strong>The American singer/songwriter hadn&rsquo;t quite made the jump from star to superstardom, when her 2017 Manchester Arena concert was the target of a suicide bombing. Grande suspended the remainder of the tour and held the One Love Manchester tribute concert a few weeks later. Grande seemed to channel trauma in real time on her next album, covering her post-traumatic stress after Manchester and struggles with break-ups in an empowering way. no tears left to cry was the first single released, with the music video featuring a bee &ndash; the symbol of Manchester &ndash; an acknowledgement of strength through togetherness. Our resilience was Ari&rsquo;s, and Ari&rsquo;s resilience was ours.</p><p><strong>2019<br /> A-side: Lil&rsquo; Nas X, Old Town Road ft. Billy Ray Cyrus<br /></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z80hp\"}}</p><p>The instrumental version of this song was released in 2018, the work of Dutch beat producer YoungKio. But it would go overground thanks to a marrying of genres that still causes headscratching to this day. Rapper Lil&rsquo; Nas X snapped up the beats &ndash; which sampled banjo from a Nine Inch Nails instrumental &ndash; and bought the rights to the song for just $30; he wrote the lyrics, inspired by the tough times he was going through, in just a day. Old Town Road initially met some resistance from the country crowd; Billboard disqualified it from its country charts because it felt the song wasn&rsquo;t country enough. But Old Town Road was not to be stopped; a remix version featuring Achy Breaky Heart hitmaker Billy Ray Cyrus helped propel the song into the stratosphere. Old Town Road ended up marking 19 weeks at the top of the US charts, a record. And it broke ground for other reasons, too. Lil Nas X (real name Montero Lamar Hill) came out as gay while the record was still number one in the US, becoming the only artist in history to do so.</p><p><strong>B-side: Lizzo, Juice<br /> </strong>It could have been a classic beamed straight from the mirrorball reflected dancefloors of the early 1980s &ndash; but no, Lizzo&rsquo;s Juice was a fresh hit from 2019, the anthem for a thousand body-positive Instagram posts. The song Truth Hurts had been a sleeper hit in 2018, but it was a sinker compared to Juice; a bold as brass self-love anthem about as subtle as a Transformers film. Juice&rsquo;s mile-high chorus (&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t my fault that I'm out here gettin&rsquo; loose/ Gotta blame it on the Goose/ Gotta blame it on my juice, baby&rdquo;) was as infectious as any in living memory.</p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>The Essential List</em></a><em>.

Everyone from Wendy&rsquo;s to Maybelline co-opted the phrase to such a degree that the artist eventually trademarked the phrase. Collaborating with Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla $ign on the track was a massive poke in the eye for anyone still thinking only one rap queen can reign supreme.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Handle me? Who gon&rsquo; handle me?/ Thinkin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s a player, he&rsquo;s a member on the team.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>19. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIcVwH47uxQ\"><strong><em>Big Thief, Not</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>The Brooklyn-based band have always won praise for finding majesty in the minutiae, and 2019 was a landmark year with two albums (UFOF and Two Hands). The top track was the lead single on the latter album, pain piercing through every one of singer/songwriter Adrianne Lenker&rsquo;s razor-sharp words. The guitar solo, or more accurately a guitar roar, is worthy of Neil Young at his peak.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the open weaving/ Nor the furnace glow/ Nor the blood of you bleeding/ As you try to let go.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>18. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84\"><strong><em>FKA twigs, Cellophane</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwrl\"}}</p><p>The British singer/songwriter&rsquo;s breathtaking, hypnotic return after three years. Stripped down to a piano-led arrangement, this tale of a relationship souring despite giving your all drew obvious parallels to the artist&rsquo;s public break up with Robert Pattinson. The fearless fragility of twigs&rsquo;s voice made heartbreak sound like being raised to the skies before crashing down to earth.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;I try but I get overwhelmed/ When you're gone, I have no one to tell.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>17. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6giKIu5jUvA\"><strong><em>Solange, Almeda</em></strong></a><br /> The sound of black pride in 2019. Solange presented a freeze frame of the area of Houston she grew up in while reciting a list of beautiful things (&ldquo;brown face, black skin, black braids, black waves&rdquo;). Playboi Carti and The-Dream joined the celebration, adding weight and joy to the mood. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;These are black-owned things/ Black faith still can&rsquo;t be washed away/ Not even in that Florida water.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>16. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZsNnuaUSNs\"><strong><em>slowthai, Nothing Great About Britain</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwrz\"}}</p><p>A snarling, pessimistic portrait of Britain from the street &ndash; covering Brexit, class warfare, and widening inequality &ndash; but told with bluntness, wit and wordplay. slowthai makes a mockery of Britishness, but he also celebrates his country, in part through the clear doffing of his cap to a host of musical influences, including Sex Pistols, The Streets and Dizzee Rascal.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I will treat you with the utmost respect only if you respect me a little bit, Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>15. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvNqNgHAEys\"><strong><em>Holly Herndon, Frontier</em></strong></a><br /> Herndon&rsquo;s third album, Proto, saw her collaborating with vocal performers and the digital voice of an AI program called Spawn. One of its most stunning and human moments came on Frontier. Inspired by Appalachian Sacred Harp singing, a single voice builds to a vocal crescendo that blurs the difference between human and machine in ways that feel comfortable, disorientating and heart-warming all at once.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;This earth doesn't care for what we need, what we breathe/ A frontier of green or of dust.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>14. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yljWf3_flbM\"><strong><em>The Highwomen, If She Ever Leaves Me</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwt4\"}}</p><p>It was billed as the first gay country song, which isn&rsquo;t strictly speaking true, but the lead track from the all-female supergroup is certainly the most high-profile one to date. Brandi Carlile subverts country ballad tradition, sending a warning to a male cowboy who has an eye on her female partner, which also felt like a welcome rejoinder to the machismo that can pervade the genre. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em>&ldquo;</strong>If she ever gives her careful heart to somebody new, well, it won&rsquo;t be for a cowboy like you.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>13. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCuhuePlP8o\"><strong><em>Lewis Capaldi, Someone You Loved</em></strong></a><br /> Scottish singer-songwriter Capaldi became the somewhat improbable break-out star of the year. His album Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent was the fastest-selling UK album of the year. And Someone You Loved topped both the UK and US singles chart &ndash; its straightforward tale about a break-up and Capaldi&rsquo;s raspy soulful voice capturing the imagination of a vast swathe of lovelorn fans.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>12. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSSKDIcpdSE\"><strong><em>Little Simz, Selfish</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwtc\"}}</p><p>It may have been a long time coming, but the London rapper is finally achieving the success that has been predicted by everyone from Kendrick Lamar to Forbes magazine. So, it&rsquo;s perhaps appropriate that it came in the slicker sound and form of Selfish. Haters are always going to hate, the rapper defiantly states, but no-one can question what she&rsquo;s earned through her own hard graft and creativity. And who are we to argue?<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;No validation, no applause/ You don&rsquo;t have to prove you got it when you know it&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>11. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDUPSNdmFew\"><strong><em>Dave, Black</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>From the groundbreaking Mercury Prize-winning album came a track that was a laser-sharp examination of contemporary racism and racial identity. The south London rapper tackles colonialism, social mobility and media coverage, but like Solange, the song is also peppered with pride about his blackness. UK listeners complained when it appeared on the Radio 1 playlist, but DJ Annie Mac replied: &ldquo;If you are genuinely offended by a man talking about the colour of his skin and how it has shaped his identity then that is a problem for you.&rdquo;<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;A kid dies, the blacker the killer, the sweeter the news/ And if he's white you give him a chance, he&rsquo;s ill and confused.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>10. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chSZCtLrgz8\"><strong><em>Charli XCX &ndash; Gone (feat Christine and the Queens)</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwtv\"}}</p><p>Sometimes a partnership makes more sense on paper than in the studio, sometimes it more than delivers on the promise. Gone is firmly in the latter camp, the two pop mavericks creating an uncompromising, existential anti-social anthem. It&rsquo;s a collaborative cri de coeur about the weight of expectation, with the unrelenting electro-funk beat providing the perfect soundtrack to their catharsis. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Am I a smoke? Am I the sun? Who decides?&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>9. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmAsUQEFYGI\"><strong><em>Tyler, The Creator, Earfquake</em></strong></a><br /> Originally written with Justin Beiber in mind, and later offered to and rejected by Rhianna, Earfquake finds the rapper singing in heartbreak mode, pleading a lover not to leave over summer sounds and harmonies. His trademark sound is boosted by vocals from R&amp;B legend Charlie Wilson, Devont&eacute; Hyne and (as it turns out, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/1142152753474617344/photo/1\">untranscribable</a>) ad-libs from Playboi Carti.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;You don't want no complication, no/ I don't want no side information/ I just need to know what's happening/ 'cause I'm for real.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>8. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7sTHoeH0eA\"><strong><em>Sharon Van Etten, Seventeen</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwv7\"}}</p><p>A self-declared love letter to New York, Seventeen is up there amongst Van Etten&rsquo;s finest work. It&rsquo;s for anyone who has ever peered back into their past and worried whether or not age has improved them. With Van Etten you don&rsquo;t quite know the answer, but let&rsquo;s face it that&rsquo;s life, and Van Etten brilliantly captures the scrambled, jumbled emotions between nostalgia and hindsight.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re gonna be/You&rsquo;ll crumple it up just to see/Afraid that you&rsquo;ll be just like me!&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>7. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlkTVMMkCP4\"><strong><em>Vampire Weekend, Harmony Hall</em></strong></a><br /> A track that&rsquo;s the equivalent of opening the curtains and letting the spring sun shine in, Harmony Hall sees the band subtly refining their sound, with Ezra Koenig&rsquo;s most poignant and accessible lyrics to date. If you like the acoustic guitar riff, rejoice, there&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5926&amp;v=qa1t5bjJbms\">two hours-worth of it here</a>.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Anger wants a voice/ Voices wanna sing/ Singers harmonize/ &lsquo;Til they can&rsquo;t hear anything.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>6. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F9jesjJMz0\"><strong><em>Lana Del Rey, The greatest</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwvp\"}}</p><p>A comedown anthem for the burned-out generation. Del Rey focused her swooning cinematic style on the American Dream, or what she thinks is left of it. The Greatest takes a sombre and elegiac view of a country swamped by political anxiety, climate change, celebrity culture, and even the false alarm of a nuclear attack on Hawaii. The apocalypse may not be now, but in Del Rey&rsquo;s hands it feels both horrifying and beautiful.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;The culture is lit and I had a ball/ I guess that I'm burned out after all.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>5. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7bfOZek9t4\"><strong><em>Rosal&iacute;a feat J Balvin &amp; El Guincho, Con Altura</em></strong></a><br /> Rosal&iacute;a has been making waves with her contemporary take on flamenco, but this is the song that put her on the international map. An effortless fusion of traditional music with old-school reggaet&oacute;n and a dash of Middle-Eastern inspiration, Rosal&iacute;a created a sound all of her own &ndash; a sound that feels a lot like the future of global pop music.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;Vivo r&aacute;pido y no tengo cura/ Ir&eacute; joven pa&rsquo; la sepulture.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>4. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9HYJbe9Y18\"><strong><em>Clairo, Bags</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwvz\"}}</p><p>Breaking up is hard to do, and sometimes even harder to explain. The lead Rostam Batmanglij-produced single from Clairo&rsquo;s album Immunity, achingly explores the kind of insignificant, unspoken things that accumulate and coalesce into the moment when a loved one walks out the door with those bags. Low-key, touching and heart-felt, the song elevated the 21-year-old from You Tube phenomenon to bona fide pop star. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Can you see me? I&rsquo;m waiting for the right time / I can&rsquo;t read you, but if you want, the pleasure&rsquo;s all mine.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>3. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ysFgElQtjI\"><strong><em>Lil Nas X feat Billy Ray Cyrus, Old Town Road (Remix)</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>Love it, hate it, or even love to hate it, you can&rsquo;t deny the song&rsquo;s domination in 2019. We all know the story: A $30 YouTube beat, a Nine Inch Nails sample, a viral moment on TikTok that turned into a controversy about whether or not the song could be classified as country music, and the genius move of adding Billy Ray Cyrus to the remix. It should never have worked, but it did.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;Ridin' on a horse, ha/ You can whip your Porsche/ I been in the valley/ You ain&rsquo;t been up off that porch, now.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>2. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaCrQL_8eMY\"><strong><em>Lizzo, Juice</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwwf\"}}</p><p>A riot of retro-funk filled with soul and sexiness, Lizzo gives Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars a joyous run for their money with this hit. Juice is Lizzo&rsquo;s finest feeling-good-about-yourself song to date. Along the way, Lizzo praises the woman in the mirror, sips Grey Goose and makes fun of a man sliding into her DMs.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;I be drippin&rsquo; so much sauce/ Got a bitch lookin&rsquo; like Rag&ugrave;.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI\"><strong><em>Billie Eilish, bad guy</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwxk\"}}</p><p>Of all the songs that propelled the remarkable rise of the 17-year-old pop prodigy this year, bad guy was the biggest and most subversive, and was the song that eventually toppled Old Town Road from the number 1 spot. Someone is taunted for being a bad guy, before flipping the tables to suggest that she&rsquo;s the real culprit. Thumbing a nose at the way people present themselves, the song has it all: Lo-fi swagger, sass in spades, and a surreal music video that <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/billie-eilish-bad-guy-music-video-memes/\">got the meme treatment</a> online.

It&rsquo;s difficult to disagree with this verdict. Over the past 12 months,&nbsp;Lizzo&nbsp;has become the inspiring, high-energy figurehead of the growing self-care movement &ndash; with its philosophy of actively nurturing and protecting your own mental and physical wellbeing &ndash;&nbsp;and a performer synonymous with unbridled joy and unapologetic self-confidence.</p><p>More like this:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/culture/story/20191119-max-martin-the-secrets-of-the-worlds-best-pop-songwriter\">The Yoda of pop music</a></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/culture/story/20191015-how-todays-rappers-are-resurrecting-the-spirit-of-punk\">Is this the new age of punk?</a></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/culture/story/20190917-the-rise-of-palestinian-pop\">The hardest place to be a pop star</a></p><p>Lizzo&rsquo;s anti-commitment hit Truth Hurts &ndash; home to the instantly iconic and inspiringly self-confident line: &ldquo;I just took a DNA test, turns out I&rsquo;m 100% that bitch&rdquo; &ndash; spent seven non-consecutive weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in September and October. In doing so, it tied a record for the longest spell at number one by a female-performed rap song. Its popularity helped Lizzo&rsquo;s acclaimed album, Cuz I Love You, to be certified gold in the US, a not inconsiderable achievement for an album in the streaming era.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ysslf\"}}</p><p>The autumn success of Truth Hurts cemented Lizzo&rsquo;s incredible mainstream breakthrough. The Detroit-born artist, whose real name is Melissa Viviane Jefferson, studied classical flute performance at the University of Houston, where her family moved when she was 10. Now, Lizzo has become a byword for body positivity and female empowerment. Google her name, and you&rsquo;ll find articles with titles like <a href=\"https://www.stylist.co.uk/people/lizzo-best-quotes-self-love-body-positivity-empowerment/263004\">Lizzo&rsquo;s best quotes on body positivity and self-empowerment</a> and <a href=\"https://parade.com/944081/alexandra-hurtado/lizzo-lyrics-self-love-quotes/\">30 self-love Lizzo lyrics to feel Good as Hell</a>. Good as Hell, Lizzo&rsquo;s other big hit, which cracked the US and UK top 10 in November, after being remixed to feature Ariana Grande, contains the same stirring message of self-worth that Lizzo regularly espouses on social media and in her interviews. &ldquo;If he don&rsquo;t love you anymore,&rdquo; she sings in a sisterly kind of way, &ldquo;just walk your fine ass out the door&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>In November, Lizzo also underlined her growing reputation as a norm-shattering, plus-size style icon by appearing on the cover of British Vogue. &ldquo;Lizzo hasn&rsquo;t captured the zeitgeist this past year so much as set it,&rdquo; says Giles Hattersley, the fashion magazine&rsquo;s features director, pointing to &ldquo;her honesty, kindness [and] the sheer force of her relatability&rdquo;. Hattersley calls her &ldquo;the perfect star for now&rdquo; because &ldquo;in these fraught times, she just makes people feel good &ndash; as anyone who's seen her preaching the art of self-care at her live shows will know&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> Despite her obvious musical talent, Lizzo&rsquo;s fame is the result of a slow, committed crawl </p></blockquote><p>In the flesh, Lizzo&rsquo;s star quality is intense and infectious. When I interviewed her for music magazine NME in August 2018, I was seriously impressed by her charisma, candour and somewhat salty sense of humour. I <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/big-reads/nme-big-read-lizzo-2372568\">wrote</a> at the time that she had a &ldquo;firecracker personality which inflames the room&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ysshr\"}}</p><p>But despite her obvious musical talent and megawatt personality, Lizzo&rsquo;s current fame is the result of a slow, committed crawl rather than a lightning-bolt breakthrough. She released her debut album Lizzobangers on a Minneapolis indie label in October 2013, earning critical acclaim but only cult success. It would be another three years before she charted for the first time with Coconut Oil, a six-track EP which was her first release on a major label.</p><p>In fact, both Good as Hell and Truth Hurts were unexpected &lsquo;sleeper hits&rsquo;. She first dropped the latter back in September 2017, but it didn&rsquo;t chart at the time; it would take a full two years for the song to climb to the top of the Billboard Hot 100. In July, she told <a href=\"https://people.com/music/lizzo-depression-almost-quit-music-after-releasing-truth-hurts/\">People</a> magazine: &ldquo;The day I released Truth Hurts was probably one of the darkest days I&rsquo;ve had ever in my career. I remember thinking, &lsquo;If I quit music now, nobody would notice. This is my best song ever, and nobody cares.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Prevailing mood</strong></p><p>So why was 2019 the year when Lizzo finally made it into the mainstream? Truth Hurts started scaling the charts after being featured in the Netflix rom-com Someone Great, which came out in April. It also gained momentum after the DNA-test line became a viral meme on video-sharing app TikTok; users would pretend to give themselves a mouth swab, then declare themselves &lsquo;100% that bitch&rsquo;, &lsquo;100% that ogre&rsquo; &ndash; a reference to Shrek &ndash; or &lsquo;100%&rsquo; anything else they fancied. This might sound like a couple of lucky breaks, but they probably wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if Lizzo&rsquo;s personal brand hadn&rsquo;t captured a prevailing socio-cultural mood. Jazmin Kopotsha, Entertainment Editor of Refinery29 UK, believes &ldquo;the music she puts out is celebratory in a way that we&rsquo;re only just starting to catch up with in society&rdquo;. Kopotsha says society is now ready to embrace the idea of &ldquo;women being powerful and feeling strength in themselves&rdquo;, something Lizzo has been promoting for some time.&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ysspg\"}}</p><p>Kopotsha also suggests, depressingly, that Lizzo has had to wait for the mainstream to make space for her. &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s kind of this &lsquo;one in, one out&rsquo; entry system in the way that society and the media and advertising like to celebrate women, particularly black women,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If you think about it, Beyonc&eacute; was kind of the go-to [figure] in terms of empowerment for a while, but she hasn&rsquo;t been spoken about in that way this year. So it feels like that&rsquo;s where Lizzo has been able to come in.&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzo&rsquo;s success has also been founded on an increasingly diverse fanbase of what she playfully calls &ldquo;Lizzbians&rdquo;, which includes a loyal LGBTQ contingent and a broad spectrum of&nbsp;women. When she appeared on the cover of African-American women&rsquo;s magazine Essence in May, Lizzo wrote on Instagram: &ldquo;This is a big one for me because for so long I felt like my music wasn&rsquo;t reaching black people and it was breakin&rsquo; my heart.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s difficult to pinpoint why Lizzo might have initially felt disconnected from black fans, but it could stem partly from her formative years on the so-called &lsquo;Twin Cities&rsquo; music scene in Minneapolis and neighbouring Saint Paul, which was dominated by white male artists. Aaron &lsquo;Lazerbeak&rsquo; Made, who co-produced her 2013 debut LP, has said that shortly after the album came out, he and Lizzo's then-manager &ldquo;constantly&rdquo; discussed how to roll it out to a broader audience. \"At that point, [Lizzo] was into the Twin Cities indie-rock scene,&rdquo; he <a href=\"http://mspmag.com/arts-and-culture/oral-history-lizzo-minneapolis/\">recalled</a> in October. &ldquo;So, a bunch of white guys [loved] her, and there [was] no connection whatsoever to the black community or anything outside of our white-guy bubble.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> At Glastobury, Lizzo got the crowd to chant her personal mantra of &ldquo;I love you, you are beautiful and you can do anything&rdquo; </p></blockquote><p>Looking beyond the music itself, it&rsquo;s arguable that the growing profile Lizzo has built this year has been founded on her already-formidable social-media presence. A hilarious clip of Lizzo waving from the back of a moving golf cart as she says &ldquo;bye bitch&rdquo; went viral in 2018, several months before the funk-pop tune Juice became her first Top 40 hit. Today, she has seven million Instagram followers, and 300,000 fans follow a tongue-in-cheek fan account dedicated to her flute, @sashabefluting. Giles Hatterley says Lizzo connects with people because &ldquo;she has a very rare and very authentic star power&rdquo;. At a time when we&rsquo;re becoming increasingly suspicious of social-media influencers and so-called &lsquo;sponcon&rsquo;, this authenticity is a very precious commodity.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yssqn\"}}</p><p>It&rsquo;s also at the heart of her live shows, which NME music journalist Hannah Mylrea hail as &ldquo;magnetic&rdquo; and &ldquo;a word-of-mouth success&rdquo;. Mylrea praises Lizzo&rsquo;s &ldquo;powerhouse&rdquo; vocals and accomplished flute playing, adding: &ldquo;The stand-out thing about Lizzo as a performer is you leave her gigs feeling really good about yourself&rdquo;. During her performance at Glastonbury Festival in June, Lizzo got the crowd to chant her personal mantra of &ldquo;I love you, you are beautiful and you can do anything&rdquo;. Mylrea says &ldquo;it might sound corny, but it was a genuinely moving and uniting, and I think people want to experience this&rdquo;.</p><p>After her stunning 2019, it&rsquo;s fascinating to speculate about what Lizzo might do next. The music industry is known for trying to capitalise on unique success stories like Lizzo&rsquo;s by replicating them &ndash; following Amy Winehouse&rsquo;s enormously popular Back to Black album, a glut of similar retro-soul-pop records were steered towards the charts. In addition to potential imitators, Jazmin Kopotsha says Lizzo might have to contend with &ldquo;brands possibly co-opting her message of self-empowerment&rdquo; in a way that may not feel entirely authentic.&nbsp;</p><p>But so far, Lizzo seems to be making smart decisions. She made a cameo appearance in Hustlers, the acclaimed Jennifer Lopez film whose themes of female solidarity and self-sufficiency complement Lizzo&rsquo;s personal brand. She&rsquo;s also resisted the urge to dilute her musical brand with gratuitous features on other artists&rsquo; songs. Her only collaborations this year have been with Grande, British pop star Charli XCX &ndash; whose own idiosyncrasy is a sound match for Lizzo&rsquo;s &ndash;&nbsp; and Missy Elliott, the rap pioneer who Lizzo hails as a personal hero. And crucially, Lizzo has weathered her first wave of controversy after Truth Hurts became the subject of plagiarism allegations. British singer-songwriter Mina Lioness <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2019/10/28/mina-lioness-lizzo-song-writer-truth-hurts-credit-interview\">said</a> in October that she&rsquo;s due to be credited as the song&rsquo;s co-writer after Lizzo confirmed that the &ldquo;100% that bitch line&rdquo; was inspired by a tweet Lioness posted in 2017. Lizzo wrote on Twitter last month: &ldquo;In 2017, while working on a demo, I saw a meme that resonated with me... I later used the line in Truth Hurts... I later learned that a tweet inspired the meme. The creator of the tweet is the person I am sharing my success with.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yssg8\"}}</p><p>In February, Lizzo&rsquo;s place in music&rsquo;s A-list could be rubber-stamped at the Grammy Awards, where she&rsquo;s nominated in eight categories. However her nod in the category for Best New Artist feels pretty ironic, given the revealing tweet that Lizzo posted in November: &ldquo;8 years of touring, giving out free tix to my undersold shows, sleepless nights in my car, losing my dad &amp; giving up on music, playing shows for free beer &amp; food w/ -32$ in my bank account, constantly writing songs, hearing &lsquo;no&rsquo; but always saying &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. Glad I never gave up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>This resilience is a key part of the Lizzo story, and another reason why she&rsquo;s been embraced as a kind of icon of self-care by millions of fans. Whatever happens next, Lizzo isn&rsquo;t just 2019&rsquo;s most exciting musical breakthrough; she&rsquo;s also its most heartwarming.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><em>&nbsp;page or message us on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>And if you liked this story,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><strong>sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</strong></a><em>, called The Essential List.

Though Frank&rsquo;s career stretched across the best part of five decades, he will always be remembered for&nbsp;The Americans, a photobook record of road journeys he made criss-crossing America in the mid-1950s. Eighty-three black-and-white pictures, captured in locations as far-flung as New Jersey and Santa Fe,&nbsp;The Americans&nbsp;caused outrage in the US for its unvarnished portraits of America and its people, and for its unblinking portrayal of racism and rural poverty. But, for all its political bite, it is the urgent beauty of Frank&rsquo;s work that stays with you &ndash; captured on the fly, these images are by turns intimate, poignant, joyous and scaldingly sad. No one had a sharper eye than Frank for the cracks in the paintwork of the American Dream; or a kinder one. He died on 9 September aged 94. (AD)</p><p><strong>Toni Morrison</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys73s\"}}</p><p>Novelist, essayist, playwright and songwriter, Toni Morrison, who died on 5 August at the age of 88, was a titan. Born Chloe Ardelia Wofford in Ohio in 1931, she fell for literature early, and initially embarked on a career in academia, and then publishing. Her autobiographical first novel, The Bluest Eye, was published in 1970, but her best-known novel remains Beloved, based on the true story of a runaway slave who killed her daughter rather than let her be recaptured. Morrison&rsquo;s might as a chronicler of the African-American experience lies not in her work&rsquo;s intense lyricism but in her determination not to avert her gaze, and she leaves behind pages of indelible, ever-necessary images. She remains the only African-American writer &ndash; and one of all too few women &ndash; to have won the Nobel Prize for Literature. (HA)</p><p><strong>Albert Finney&nbsp;</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys8r2\"}}</p><p>Finney was more than simply a brilliant performer &ndash; rather,&nbsp;as one of a wave of working-class actors who rose to the top in the 1960s, he helped revolutionise the profession. The son of a Salford bookmaker, he went to Rada, and after leaving, quickly excelled on the stage in Shakespeare, among other things. The film role that made his name was rather less classical, however: as one of the era&rsquo;s iconic &lsquo;angry young men&rsquo;, Arthur Seaton in 1960&rsquo;s Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, he had a raw, visceral screen charisma to burn. Another career-making part as the roguish lead in Tony Richardson&rsquo;s 1963 adaptation of Henry Fielding&rsquo;s Tom Jones followed, gaining him the first of five Oscar nominations.</p><p>Throughout his career, Finney avoided typecasting. His versatility was shown in the range of his performances, from his ripe turns as Hercule Poirot in 1974&rsquo;s star-studded Murder on the Orient Express, and as an embittered thespian in the 1983 adaptation of Ronald Harwood&rsquo;s The Dresser, to his more understated work as the cuckolded Classics master in the 1994 take on Terence Rattigan&rsquo;s The Browning Version, and a kindly, world-weary lawyer in Erin Brockovich (2000). One of his last great performances came on the small screen: in the BBC/HBO drama The Gathering Storm, he played Winston Churchill to formidable effect. He died on 7 February, aged 82.&nbsp;(HM)</p><p><strong>Scott Walker</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys7b8\"}}</p><p>Scott Walker&rsquo;s music could be sweetly melodic or utterly startling; it always exuded a strange allure. Born Noel Scott Engel in the US, he relocated to Britain in the mid-60s, initially seizing fame as frontman of The Walker Brothers, whose distinctly poignant strain of pop yielded classics including The Sun Ain&rsquo;t Gonna Shine (Anymore) and their version of Make It Easy On Yourself<em>; </em>he also hosted his own TV show. Scott Walker&rsquo;s vocals &ndash; richly brooding, often arch &ndash; always remained unmistakeable, but his repertoire constantly evolved, moving into increasingly experimental realms through his solo records (such as the surreal serenades of 1969&rsquo;s hypnotic Scott 4) and collaborations. He was an enigmatic figure, and retired from live performance (even when he curated London&rsquo;s Meltdown Festival in 2000), yet he was no recluse; he worked with indie acts including Pulp, Bat For Lashes and Seattle avant rockers Sunn O))), was cited as an influence by David Bowie, and continued to release evocative, unpredictable work, whether wielding industrial showtunes (Bish Bosch<em>, </em>2012) or composing sleek movie scores (Vox Lux, 2018). By the time of his death, aged 76, Walker had established his own creative scene, without limits. (AH)</p><p><strong>Agn&egrave;s Varda</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys8sv\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m playing the part of a little old lady,&rdquo; Agn&egrave;s Varda says in her wise, lyrical memoir-as-film The Beaches of Agnes (2008). By then the New Wave pioneer had become the beloved granny of cinema, known for fiction and non-fiction alike. No wonder she has more films in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191125-the-100-greatest-films-directed-by-women-poll\">BBC Culture&rsquo;s poll of the Greatest Films Directed by Women</a> than anyone else. Her astonishing range went beyond gender, though, with films that remain startling in their intimacy, innovation and social resonance. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191125-greatest-films-directed-by-women-film-poll-agns-varda\">Cl&eacute;o from 5 to 7</a> (1962) is a graceful New Wave classic about a woman confronting mortality. One Sings, the Other Doesn&rsquo;t (1977) is a feminist anthem dealing with abortion. In documentaries, like The Gleaners and I (2000), Varda appears on screen, a curious, inviting presence. And Jacquot de Nantes (1991), about her husband, director Jacques Demy, is a beautiful hybrid of memory and fiction. She was creative to the end. Her white hair with a bright red border perfectly captured how Varda acknowledged age but resisted its power to stop her. She died on 29 March at the age of 90. (CJ)</p><p><strong>Peter Fonda</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys8dk\"}}</p><p>The son of Henry, brother of Jane, and father of Bridget, Peter Fonda worked steadily for decades, and was Oscar-nominated for his sensitive performance in Ulee&rsquo;s Gold (1997). But he will always be associated with the counterculture of the 1960s, when a remark of his &ndash; &ldquo;I know what it&rsquo;s like to be dead&rdquo; &ndash; was used by John Lennon in The Beatles&rsquo; She Said She Said. His defining role was as a philosophical biker in Easy Rider (1969), the radical semi-improvised road movie he made with Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson. He had enough humour and self-awareness to pastiche that role in Ghost Rider and Wild Hogs (both 2007), among other films, in which his square-jawed Californian handsomeness was as striking as ever. He died on 16 August, aged 79. (NB)</p><p><strong>Judith Kerr</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ysfxx\"}}</p><p>In Judith Kerr&rsquo;s last interview, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/18/judith-kerr-interview-the-tiger-who-came-to-tea\">she told The Guardian</a> her guiltiest pleasure was to drink the dregs of whisky from the night before. Published just days before her death, this cheeky, charming statement was textbook Kerr, symbolic of the character of much of her work. Most famous for her children&rsquo;s books The Tiger Who Came to Tea and the 17-title Mog series, Kerr spent most of her life in the UK, having fled from Germany with her Jewish family when she was 13. She won a scholarship to the Central School of Art and Design, and wrote more than 30 books, many of which she also illustrated. She was appointed OBE in 2012 for services to children&rsquo;s literature and Holocaust education, received a lifetime achievement award from the British literary charity BookTrust, and in the week before her death, was named illustrator of the year at the British Book Awards. In a radical move for a children&rsquo;s author, Kerr wrote Goodbye Mog in 2002, in which the beloved feline dies. In an interview about the book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/dec/04/booksforchildrenandteenagers.familyandrelationships\">she told The Guardian</a> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming up to 80&hellip; and you begin to think about those who are going to be left&hellip; I just wanted to say: Remember. Remember me. But do get on with your lives.&rdquo; She died on 22 May at the age of 95. (AC)</p><p><strong>Jo&atilde;o Gilberto</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys8j8\"}}</p><p>Jo&atilde;o Gilberto, celebrated as the founding father of Brazilian bossa nova (&lsquo;new wave&rsquo;), and known as O Mito (&lsquo;the legend&rsquo;) had an unusually commanding way with melodies. His softly persuasive vocals and gently lilting guitar rhythms were also fantastically insistent, becoming synonymous with the Carioca chic of 60s Rio de Janeiro. Gilberto himself had been born in Bahia, and also forged a significant bond with US jazz musicians, notably saxophonist Stan Getz (with whom he recorded a series of classic albums), but Rio was the hotbed of his sound, which merged traditional roots such as samba with a contemporary energy. His collaborations with Ant&ocirc;nio Carlos Jobim took bossa nova to an international audience, and inspired further Brazilian innovators, such as Caetano Veloso; his 1958 version of <em>Chega de Saudade </em>(&lsquo;No More Blues&rsquo;, with lyrics by Vinicius de Moraes) was a crossover smash, and his most legendary track was arguably The Girl From Ipanema, notably a version sung by his then-wife Astrud Gilberto. Gilberto&rsquo;s dreamy brilliance lingers, like a cool breeze across pop culture. He died on 6 July, at the age of 88. (AH)</p><p><strong>Doris Day</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yd0c1\"}}</p><p>Doris Day&rsquo;s image was so wholesome that even her sex comedies were innocent. Those movies seem quaint now, but in the 1950s and 60s they made her one of Hollywood&rsquo;s biggest box-office stars. In films like Pillow Talk (1959), Rock Hudson tried to seduce her and never succeeded. The attempt alone was racy for its time. Day started as a singer, whose 1945 hit recording of Sentimental Journey established her style, expressively bringing out the emotions of the lyrics. On screen she brought warmth and freckle-faced girl-next-door naturalness to dozens of films, including the musicals Calamity Jane (1953), and The Pajama Game (1957). Atypically, she starred in Alfred Hitchcock&rsquo;s thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). Her character&rsquo;s background as a singer gave Day an excuse to perform Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be Will Be), which became a pop hit and her signature song. Day said her purer-than-snow image was &ldquo;more make-believe than any film part I ever played,&rdquo; but it endeared her to generations of fans. She died on 13 May at the age of 97. (CJ)</p><p><strong>Karl Lagerfeld</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys8fs\"}}</p><p>With his trademark dark glasses, fingerless gloves and white ponytail, Karl Lagerfeld was a master of self-mythology. He was also a genius of design &ndash; bringing his irreverent alchemy to all he touched. Born in Hamburg, he moved to Paris as a teenager, and, untrained, worked his way up in fashion. He became creative director of Fendi, and then, from 1983, of Chanel. He transformed the venerable house, and created spectacular catwalk shows. Vogue supremo Anna Wintour said of him: &ldquo;He represents the soul of fashion: restless, forward-looking and voraciously attentive to our changing culture.&rdquo; He was well-known for his pithy declarations, among them &ldquo;Sweatpants are a sign of defeat,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much down to Earth. Just not this Earth.&rdquo; He died on 15 February at the age of 85. (LB)</p><p><strong>John Singleton</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ysjhn\"}}</p><p>John Singleton was only 23 when his debut, 1991&rsquo;s Boyz n the Hood, broke new ground in its depiction of ghetto life in South Central Los Angeles. Calling himself &ldquo;the first film-maker from the hip-hop generation&rdquo;, he also became the first African-American ever to be nominated for the best director Oscar, and he remains the youngest ever nominee in that category. Singleton went on to direct action movies which appealed more to multiplex audiences than to awards voters (Shaft, 2 Fast 2 Furious), and his career tailed off in the last decade, making it all the sadder that he died at just 51, on 28 April, before he had the chance to make the comeback he deserved. (NB)</p><p><strong>Jessye Norman</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys8k3\"}}</p><p>The US operatic soprano Jessye Norman was renowned for her glorious poise and technical prowess, but she also delivered iconic roles and recitals from Purcell to Bizet, Beethoven and Verdi with an exceptional warmth and emotive drama. She would recollect her Deep South upbringing in her acclaimed 2014 memoir, Stand Up Straight And Sing!, and she also committed to providing inclusive opportunities for youth, by co-founding the free Jessye Norman School for the Arts in her birthplace of Augusta, Georgia. Norman&rsquo;s numerous legendary performances included her 1989 Bastille Day bicentenary appearance &ndash; wrapped in a Tricolour robe, singing La Marseillaise (broadcast to a global audience of around 500 million); she performed Amazing Grace at an anti-apartheid concert marking Mandela&rsquo;s 70th birthday; she graced ceremonies for presidents and royalty, and her many accolades included a lifetime achievement Grammy (2006). Norman&rsquo;s immaculate high art appealed emphatically to the heart. She died on 30 September at the age of 74. (AH)</p><p><strong>Rutger Hauer</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys84h\"}}</p><p>The Dutch actor, is of course, best known for one role: the replicant Roy Batty in Ridley Scott&rsquo;s film Blade Runner. And his place in cinema history is assured by one iconic, climactic scene in that sci-fi classic: where his dying cyborg character declares in a heart-rending final monologue that all his memories will be lost like &ldquo;tears in rain&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a parting shot all the more poignant for the fact that the key lines were written by Hauer himself.&nbsp;</p><p>That beautiful moment aside, Hauer had a prolific and eclectic career right up until the end. He first made his name in the 1970s in his home country, forming a rich working relationship with director Paul Verhoeven. His US debut came as the villain in the 1981 Sylvester Stallone thriller Nighthawks, before Blade Runner then firmly put him on the Hollywood map, leading to other memorable roles as a psychopathic hitch-hiker in The Hitcher (1986), and an atypically heroic turn in fantasy drama Ladyhawke (1985). In recent times, he became something of a b-movie icon, mixing cameos in the likes of Sin City and Batman Begins with innumerable roles in grindhouse-style thrillers and horrors. But whatever the scale of the project, Hauer&rsquo;s intense energy made everything he did never less than compelling. He died on 19 July, aged 75. (HM)</p><p><strong>Robert Evans</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys8bp\"}}</p><p>As the head of production at Paramount Pictures, and then as an independent producer, Robert Evans oversaw some of the greatest films of the 1960s and 70s, including The Godfather, Chinatown and Rosemary&rsquo;s Baby. But he was almost as famous for a private life, which epitomised the sleazier side of Hollywood glamour. By the time of his death on 26 October at the age of 89, he had been married seven times, been convicted of cocaine-trafficking, and had inspired numerous fictional wheeler-dealers, including Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. His personal and professional lives came together in&nbsp;The Kid Stays in the Picture (2002),&nbsp;a documentary adapted from his wry tell-all memoir. It was one of the most entertaining of all the films to benefit from his contributions. (NB)</p><p><strong>Andrea Levy </strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys8pb\"}}</p><p>Andrea Levy didn&rsquo;t start writing until her 30s and published just six books, but her fiction won a wide readership, and had an outsize impact on British publishing, forcibly demonstrating that stories with black protagonists could have universal appeal. Born in 1956 to Jamaican immigrants of mixed descent, and raised in a north London council flat, her awareness of her own ethnicity was awakened by a racist slight in young adulthood. It brought urgency to her warm, funny prose, and galvanised her award-winning break-out novel, Small Island, which gave an irrepressible voice to the Windrush generation of which her parents were a part. It has since sold over a million copies in the UK alone. Levy died on 14 February at the age of 62. (HA)</p><p><strong>IM Pei</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys8lc\"}}</p><p>IM Pei was a Chinese-American architect whose bold geometries and dazzling use of glass and concrete earned him great acclaim. Born in Canton in 1917, Pei grew up in Shanghai, then studied architecture in the US, where he stayed. Among his most famous buildings are the beautifully-crafted, modernist East Wing of the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, and the sharp, sky-high Hancock Tower in Boston. In 1983 he won the Pritzker Prize, often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture. In 1989, the Louvre Pyramid was completed, and the stunning glass-and-metal structure has since become a famous Paris landmark. Pei said: &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one thing I know I didn&rsquo;t do wrong, it&rsquo;s the Louvre.&rdquo; He died on 16 May at the age of 102. (LB)</p><p><strong>Terry O&rsquo;Neill</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys75t\"}}</p><p>O&rsquo;Neill was a photographer from another era: a member of the British Fleet Street paparazzi who rose from photographing celebrities to become a kind of celebrity himself. A jobbing snapper who found that his Cockney gift of the gab meant he could charm rich and famous folk into posing for him, O&rsquo;Neill photographed anyone who was anyone in the 1960s and 70s. Among those he shot were The Rolling Stones, Sinatra, Brigitte Bardot, Raquel Welch, Elvis, David Bowie and a small galaxy of starlets (a number of whom, he liked to boast, also ended up in his bed). As well as his instinct for finding a fresh angle that could jump off a magazine page, it was O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s talent for photographic flattery that paid off. Though his images are often candid &ndash; a moody Bowie dwarfed by his barking dog, Faye Dunaway hanging out with her Oscar by the pool &ndash; his subjects never lose their all-important allure. He died on 16 November at the age of 81. (AD)</p><p><strong>Mary Oliver</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ystrm\"}}</p><p>One of America&rsquo;s most popular poets, and certainly its bestselling, Mary Oliver was born in 1935 in Cleveland, Ohio, where the need to escape a dysfunctional childhood made her first a reader and then a writer. Her muse was the natural world, and over a career spanning more than 50 years and laurels aplenty, she hymned the owls and frogs and wild geese of New England, where she settled with her lifelong partner, the photographer Molly Malone Cook. The sheer accessibility of her generous work sometimes made critics leery, but beneath its calm surface there pulses a luminous life force, and it wasn&rsquo;t unusual for fans to credit her with teaching them how to live. She died on 17 January at the age of 83. (HA)</p><p><strong>Stanley Donen</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ys78f\"}}</p><p>Director Stanley Donen made the camera his dance partner, and helped shape the singing, dancing, gleeful Hollywood musical at its best. His films include some of the most iconic moments on screen. Co-directing with Gene Kelly, he turned splashing around in puddles into the joyful Singin&rsquo; in the Rain (1952). As a solo director, he had Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling in Royal Wedding (1951), and singing to Audrey Hepburn in Funny Face (1957). His musicals were groundbreaking in the fluid way he made choreography and songs truly cinematic. In the 1960s, he directed sophisticated dramas, two with Hepburn, the thriller Charade (1963) and the bittersweet marital saga Two for the Road (1967). Inspired by watching Astaire on screen, Donen arrived in Hollywood as an aspiring dancer, but his best move was to glide behind the camera. He died on 21 Feb at the age of 94. (CJ)</p><p><strong>Michel Legrand</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07ysjwp\"}}</p><p>The French composer Michel Legrand created some of most memorable, romantically lush film scores of the past 50 years. If you happen to hear The Windmills of Your Mind and it lingers in your head, you&rsquo;re hearing Legrand&rsquo;s legacy. He won an Academy Award for that song, from The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), and for the scores of Summer of &lsquo;42 (1971) and, in a less romantic vein, Barbara Streisand&rsquo;s Yentl (1983). Beyond Hollywood, he was a prolific pianist, arranger, accompanist and singer throughout his long career. He began as a jazz pianist and arranger, whose acclaimed 1958 album Legrand Jazz featured performances from some of the greats, including Miles Davis and John Coltrane. From the 1960s on, he composed elegant scores for his friends in the French New Wave. Jacques Demy's musical The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) includes what would become one of Legrand&rsquo;s most famous songs, I Will Wait for You. Like so much of his music, its melody, full of yearning and heartbreak, lingers. He died on 26 January at the age of 86.

Here are the tracks that topped our playlist, setting the scene for an exciting decade to come. You can listen to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6rf4M1qZUHXZD97oBpZGn8\">all 20 tracks here</a> <em>(Warning: Contains some language that may offend)</em></p><p><strong><em>20. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbcLcSY2au4\"><strong><em>Megan Thee Stallion, Hot Girl Summer</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwr6\"}}</p><p>The meme that turned into a movement; the song was an unapologetic call to have a good time and not give a flying flamingo about what anybody thinks. Everyone from Wendy&rsquo;s to Maybelline co-opted the phrase to such a degree that the artist eventually trademarked the phrase. Collaborating with Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla $ign on the track was a massive poke in the eye for anyone still thinking only one rap queen can reign supreme.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Handle me? Who gon&rsquo; handle me?/ Thinkin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s a player, he&rsquo;s a member on the team.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>19. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIcVwH47uxQ\"><strong><em>Big Thief, Not</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>The Brooklyn-based band have always won praise for finding majesty in the minutiae, and 2019 was a landmark year with two albums (UFOF and Two Hands). The top track was the lead single on the latter album, pain piercing through every one of singer/songwriter Adrianne Lenker&rsquo;s razor-sharp words. The guitar solo, or more accurately a guitar roar, is worthy of Neil Young at his peak.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the open weaving/ Nor the furnace glow/ Nor the blood of you bleeding/ As you try to let go.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>18. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84\"><strong><em>FKA twigs, Cellophane</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwrl\"}}</p><p>The British singer/songwriter&rsquo;s breathtaking, hypnotic return after three years. Stripped down to a piano-led arrangement, this tale of a relationship souring despite giving your all drew obvious parallels to the artist&rsquo;s public break up with Robert Pattinson. The fearless fragility of twigs&rsquo;s voice made heartbreak sound like being raised to the skies before crashing down to earth.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;I try but I get overwhelmed/ When you're gone, I have no one to tell.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>17. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6giKIu5jUvA\"><strong><em>Solange, Almeda</em></strong></a><br /> The sound of black pride in 2019. Solange presented a freeze frame of the area of Houston she grew up in while reciting a list of beautiful things (&ldquo;brown face, black skin, black braids, black waves&rdquo;). Playboi Carti and The-Dream joined the celebration, adding weight and joy to the mood. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;These are black-owned things/ Black faith still can&rsquo;t be washed away/ Not even in that Florida water.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>16. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZsNnuaUSNs\"><strong><em>slowthai, Nothing Great About Britain</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwrz\"}}</p><p>A snarling, pessimistic portrait of Britain from the street &ndash; covering Brexit, class warfare, and widening inequality &ndash; but told with bluntness, wit and wordplay. slowthai makes a mockery of Britishness, but he also celebrates his country, in part through the clear doffing of his cap to a host of musical influences, including Sex Pistols, The Streets and Dizzee Rascal.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I will treat you with the utmost respect only if you respect me a little bit, Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>15. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvNqNgHAEys\"><strong><em>Holly Herndon, Frontier</em></strong></a><br /> Herndon&rsquo;s third album, Proto, saw her collaborating with vocal performers and the digital voice of an AI program called Spawn. One of its most stunning and human moments came on Frontier. Inspired by Appalachian Sacred Harp singing, a single voice builds to a vocal crescendo that blurs the difference between human and machine in ways that feel comfortable, disorientating and heart-warming all at once.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;This earth doesn't care for what we need, what we breathe/ A frontier of green or of dust.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>14. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yljWf3_flbM\"><strong><em>The Highwomen, If She Ever Leaves Me</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwt4\"}}</p><p>It was billed as the first gay country song, which isn&rsquo;t strictly speaking true, but the lead track from the all-female supergroup is certainly the most high-profile one to date. Brandi Carlile subverts country ballad tradition, sending a warning to a male cowboy who has an eye on her female partner, which also felt like a welcome rejoinder to the machismo that can pervade the genre. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em>&ldquo;</strong>If she ever gives her careful heart to somebody new, well, it won&rsquo;t be for a cowboy like you.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>13. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCuhuePlP8o\"><strong><em>Lewis Capaldi, Someone You Loved</em></strong></a><br /> Scottish singer-songwriter Capaldi became the somewhat improbable break-out star of the year. His album Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent was the fastest-selling UK album of the year. And Someone You Loved topped both the UK and US singles chart &ndash; its straightforward tale about a break-up and Capaldi&rsquo;s raspy soulful voice capturing the imagination of a vast swathe of lovelorn fans.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>12. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSSKDIcpdSE\"><strong><em>Little Simz, Selfish</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwtc\"}}</p><p>It may have been a long time coming, but the London rapper is finally achieving the success that has been predicted by everyone from Kendrick Lamar to Forbes magazine. So, it&rsquo;s perhaps appropriate that it came in the slicker sound and form of Selfish. Haters are always going to hate, the rapper defiantly states, but no-one can question what she&rsquo;s earned through her own hard graft and creativity. And who are we to argue?<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;No validation, no applause/ You don&rsquo;t have to prove you got it when you know it&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>11. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDUPSNdmFew\"><strong><em>Dave, Black</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>From the groundbreaking Mercury Prize-winning album came a track that was a laser-sharp examination of contemporary racism and racial identity. The south London rapper tackles colonialism, social mobility and media coverage, but like Solange, the song is also peppered with pride about his blackness. UK listeners complained when it appeared on the Radio 1 playlist, but DJ Annie Mac replied: &ldquo;If you are genuinely offended by a man talking about the colour of his skin and how it has shaped his identity then that is a problem for you.&rdquo;<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;A kid dies, the blacker the killer, the sweeter the news/ And if he's white you give him a chance, he&rsquo;s ill and confused.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>10. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chSZCtLrgz8\"><strong><em>Charli XCX &ndash; Gone (feat Christine and the Queens)</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwtv\"}}</p><p>Sometimes a partnership makes more sense on paper than in the studio, sometimes it more than delivers on the promise. Gone is firmly in the latter camp, the two pop mavericks creating an uncompromising, existential anti-social anthem. It&rsquo;s a collaborative cri de coeur about the weight of expectation, with the unrelenting electro-funk beat providing the perfect soundtrack to their catharsis. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Am I a smoke? Am I the sun? Who decides?&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>9. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmAsUQEFYGI\"><strong><em>Tyler, The Creator, Earfquake</em></strong></a><br /> Originally written with Justin Beiber in mind, and later offered to and rejected by Rhianna, Earfquake finds the rapper singing in heartbreak mode, pleading a lover not to leave over summer sounds and harmonies. His trademark sound is boosted by vocals from R&amp;B legend Charlie Wilson, Devont&eacute; Hyne and (as it turns out, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/1142152753474617344/photo/1\">untranscribable</a>) ad-libs from Playboi Carti.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;You don't want no complication, no/ I don't want no side information/ I just need to know what's happening/ 'cause I'm for real.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>8. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7sTHoeH0eA\"><strong><em>Sharon Van Etten, Seventeen</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwv7\"}}</p><p>A self-declared love letter to New York, Seventeen is up there amongst Van Etten&rsquo;s finest work. It&rsquo;s for anyone who has ever peered back into their past and worried whether or not age has improved them. With Van Etten you don&rsquo;t quite know the answer, but let&rsquo;s face it that&rsquo;s life, and Van Etten brilliantly captures the scrambled, jumbled emotions between nostalgia and hindsight.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re gonna be/You&rsquo;ll crumple it up just to see/Afraid that you&rsquo;ll be just like me!&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>7. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlkTVMMkCP4\"><strong><em>Vampire Weekend, Harmony Hall</em></strong></a><br /> A track that&rsquo;s the equivalent of opening the curtains and letting the spring sun shine in, Harmony Hall sees the band subtly refining their sound, with Ezra Koenig&rsquo;s most poignant and accessible lyrics to date. If you like the acoustic guitar riff, rejoice, there&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5926&amp;v=qa1t5bjJbms\">two hours-worth of it here</a>.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Anger wants a voice/ Voices wanna sing/ Singers harmonize/ &lsquo;Til they can&rsquo;t hear anything.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>6. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F9jesjJMz0\"><strong><em>Lana Del Rey, The greatest</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwvp\"}}</p><p>A comedown anthem for the burned-out generation. Del Rey focused her swooning cinematic style on the American Dream, or what she thinks is left of it. The Greatest takes a sombre and elegiac view of a country swamped by political anxiety, climate change, celebrity culture, and even the false alarm of a nuclear attack on Hawaii. The apocalypse may not be now, but in Del Rey&rsquo;s hands it feels both horrifying and beautiful.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;The culture is lit and I had a ball/ I guess that I'm burned out after all.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>5. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7bfOZek9t4\"><strong><em>Rosal&iacute;a feat J Balvin &amp; El Guincho, Con Altura</em></strong></a><br /> Rosal&iacute;a has been making waves with her contemporary take on flamenco, but this is the song that put her on the international map. An effortless fusion of traditional music with old-school reggaet&oacute;n and a dash of Middle-Eastern inspiration, Rosal&iacute;a created a sound all of her own &ndash; a sound that feels a lot like the future of global pop music.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;Vivo r&aacute;pido y no tengo cura/ Ir&eacute; joven pa&rsquo; la sepulture.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>4. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9HYJbe9Y18\"><strong><em>Clairo, Bags</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwvz\"}}</p><p>Breaking up is hard to do, and sometimes even harder to explain. The lead Rostam Batmanglij-produced single from Clairo&rsquo;s album Immunity, achingly explores the kind of insignificant, unspoken things that accumulate and coalesce into the moment when a loved one walks out the door with those bags. Low-key, touching and heart-felt, the song elevated the 21-year-old from You Tube phenomenon to bona fide pop star. <br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;Can you see me? I&rsquo;m waiting for the right time / I can&rsquo;t read you, but if you want, the pleasure&rsquo;s all mine.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>3. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ysFgElQtjI\"><strong><em>Lil Nas X feat Billy Ray Cyrus, Old Town Road (Remix)</em></strong></a><strong><em><br /> </em></strong>Love it, hate it, or even love to hate it, you can&rsquo;t deny the song&rsquo;s domination in 2019. We all know the story: A $30 YouTube beat, a Nine Inch Nails sample, a viral moment on TikTok that turned into a controversy about whether or not the song could be classified as country music, and the genius move of adding Billy Ray Cyrus to the remix. It should never have worked, but it did.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric: </em></strong>&ldquo;Ridin' on a horse, ha/ You can whip your Porsche/ I been in the valley/ You ain&rsquo;t been up off that porch, now.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>2. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaCrQL_8eMY\"><strong><em>Lizzo, Juice</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwwf\"}}</p><p>A riot of retro-funk filled with soul and sexiness, Lizzo gives Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars a joyous run for their money with this hit. Juice is Lizzo&rsquo;s finest feeling-good-about-yourself song to date. Along the way, Lizzo praises the woman in the mirror, sips Grey Goose and makes fun of a man sliding into her DMs.<br /> <strong><em>Memorable lyric:</em></strong> &ldquo;I be drippin&rsquo; so much sauce/ Got a bitch lookin&rsquo; like Rag&ugrave;.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI\"><strong><em>Billie Eilish, bad guy</em></strong></a></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwxk\"}}</p><p>Of all the songs that propelled the remarkable rise of the 17-year-old pop prodigy this year, bad guy was the biggest and most subversive, and was the song that eventually toppled Old Town Road from the number 1 spot. Someone is taunted for being a bad guy, before flipping the tables to suggest that she&rsquo;s the real culprit. Thumbing a nose at the way people present themselves, the song has it all: Lo-fi swagger, sass in spades, and a surreal music video that <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/billie-eilish-bad-guy-music-video-memes/\">got the meme treatment</a> online.

The singer-songwriter, whose musical journey began after she started writing poetry, cites influences as diverse as Fela Kuti, The Doors&rsquo; Jim Morrison and poet Sylvia Plath. Songs like Sophie show almost Lorde levels of irresistible hooks, while Super Sad Generation is a quiet anthem for Extinction Rebellion times.<br /> <strong><em>Critics say:</em></strong> &ldquo;Arlo Parks&nbsp;has carved out a niche in committing to music the joyous highs and crushing lows of the emotional rollercoaster that is adolescence.&rdquo; (<em>The Guardian</em>)<br /> <strong><em>Fans say:</em></strong> &ldquo;She's from Hammersmith - same as me...

Her father bought her a secondhand guitar, and Beabadoobee wrote her first song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VMSdwRCKaU\">Coffee</a>, in her bedroom in 2017. A friend uploaded it onto Spotify and Bandcamp, where it received hundreds of thousands of plays within weeks.

Born in LA, Celeste was three when her parents split, and she moved to the UK with her mother. She began singing around 10 years ago when she was inspired by hearing Elton John's Your Song, and wrote her first song at 16. She released an EP with Lily Allen&rsquo;s Bank Holiday Records label in 2017. The following year, Celeste signed to Polydor and toured with label-mate Michael Kiwanuka, who himself topped the BBC&rsquo;s Sound of 2012 poll. <br /> <strong><em>Critics say:</em></strong> &ldquo;Celeste is a once-in-a-generation talent.

Barnes drummed for the likes of spoken word artist Kate Tempest before releasing her own material in 2015. Now 29, this self-assured solo artist won&rsquo;t be pinned down &ndash; her material so far fizzes with energy and abandon, drawing comparisons to everyone from Massive Attack to MIA and early Bjork.

The only artist to have done this before him was Lewis Capaldi, who rose to number one on the Billboard chart this year. So expectations are large for the blue-eyed soul man with a lo-fi sound that melds Motown, jazz and hip-hop beats, matched with a voice that commands comparisons with Amy Winehouse and Simply Red&rsquo;s Mick Hucknall. His singles so far &ndash; all of which he wrote, played on and produced &ndash; were written in the midst of his first break up, and candidly cover the trials and tribulations of being in love.<br /> <strong><em>Critics say:</em></strong> &ldquo;At his best, he writes dreamy Al Green-inspired hooks which insinuate themselves instantly within the boudoir of your mind.&rdquo; (<em>The Scotsman</em>)<br /> <strong><em>He says:</em></strong> &ldquo;People in Glasgow can smell bullshit from afar.

Then the song started moving units in the millions and climbed its way up the US Billboard charts, peaking at number 36 in 1980, and at number three on the UK Singles Chart. Rapper&rsquo;s Delight wasn&rsquo;t the first hip-hop song, but it was the genre&rsquo;s commercial Big Bang, and a sign that this music born in the housing project hallways and public parks of the Bronx was more than a passing fad.&nbsp;</p><p>Hip-hop is pop culture now. The genre&rsquo;s dominance of radio waves, streaming numbers, and billboard charts is undeniable, not to mention its influence on everything from avant-garde electronica to the DNA of mainstream pop music from artists like Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande.&nbsp;</p><p>But it&rsquo;s more than that. Hip-hop has become a dominant cultural force, driving conversations about music, literature, and entertainment forward. Cardi B and Common are movie stars. Young Thug has created a wake of imitators that span genres and sounds. Kendrick Lamar won a Pulitzer Prize for his 2018 album DAMN. And it has become a truly global phenomenon, crossing ethnic, linguistic, and geographical boundaries. The journey from the turntables of DJ Kool Herc to the addictive, meme-ified sounds of Megan Thee Stallion and Lil&rsquo; Nas X was long, but hip hop is here to stay.&nbsp;</p><p>We asked 108 critics, artists, tastemakers, producers, and photographers from 15 different countries to name their personal top five hip-hop tracks of all time. There were more than 280 different songs named, a testament to the breadth and depth of the genre, and how the term &lsquo;greatest&rsquo; can be interpreted in various ways.&nbsp;</p><p>The results are dominated by the so-called &lsquo;Golden Age&rsquo; of hip-hop between the mid-80s and mid-90s, though there are some surprises from a more recent vintage with Kanye West&rsquo;s Pusha T-assisted Runaway taking 12th place. There was a remarkable lack of women in the Top 25; only Queen Latifah&rsquo;s 1993 hit &ldquo;U.N.I.T.Y.&rdquo; and Lauryn Hill&rsquo;s supremely catchy &ldquo;Doo Wop (That Thing)&rdquo; appear in the list.

Rapper&rsquo;s Delight, the track that arguably started it all, came in at number 14.&nbsp;</p><p>The full list of critics&rsquo; picks is below. One more thing to add: The purpose of polls like these should be to generate debate as well as encourage discovery.

The singer-songwriter, whose musical journey began after she started writing poetry, cites influences as diverse as Fela Kuti, The Doors&rsquo; Jim Morrison and poet Sylvia Plath. Songs like Sophie show almost Lorde levels of irresistible hooks, while Super Sad Generation is a quiet anthem for Extinction Rebellion times.<br /> <strong><em>Critics say:</em></strong> &ldquo;Arlo Parks&nbsp;has carved out a niche in committing to music the joyous highs and crushing lows of the emotional rollercoaster that is adolescence.&rdquo; (<em>The Guardian</em>)<br /> <strong><em>Fans say:</em></strong> &ldquo;She's from Hammersmith - same as me...

Born in LA, Celeste was three when her parents split, and she moved to the UK with her mother. She began singing around 10 years ago when she was inspired by hearing Elton John's Your Song, and wrote her first song at 16. She released an EP with Lily Allen&rsquo;s Bank Holiday Records label in 2017. The following year, Celeste signed to Polydor and toured with label-mate Michael Kiwanuka, who himself topped the BBC&rsquo;s Sound of 2012 poll. <br /> <strong><em>Critics say:</em></strong> &ldquo;Celeste is a once-in-a-generation talent.

Then the song started moving units in the millions and climbed its way up the US Billboard charts, peaking at number 36 in 1980, and at number three on the UK Singles Chart. Rapper&rsquo;s Delight wasn&rsquo;t the first hip-hop song, but it was the genre&rsquo;s commercial Big Bang, and a sign that this music born in the housing project hallways and public parks of the Bronx was more than a passing fad.&nbsp;</p><p>Hip-hop is pop culture now. The genre&rsquo;s dominance of radio waves, streaming numbers, and billboard charts is undeniable, not to mention its influence on everything from avant-garde electronica to the DNA of mainstream pop music from artists like Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande.&nbsp;</p><p>But it&rsquo;s more than that. Hip-hop has become a dominant cultural force, driving conversations about music, literature, and entertainment forward. Cardi B and Common are movie stars. Young Thug has created a wake of imitators that span genres and sounds. Kendrick Lamar won a Pulitzer Prize for his 2018 album DAMN. And it has become a truly global phenomenon, crossing ethnic, linguistic, and geographical boundaries. The journey from the turntables of DJ Kool Herc to the addictive, meme-ified sounds of Megan Thee Stallion and Lil&rsquo; Nas X was long, but hip hop is here to stay.&nbsp;</p><p>We asked 108 critics, artists, tastemakers, producers, and photographers from 15 different countries to name their personal top five hip-hop tracks of all time. There were more than 280 different songs named, a testament to the breadth and depth of the genre, and how the term &lsquo;greatest&rsquo; can be interpreted in various ways.&nbsp;</p><p>The results are dominated by the so-called &lsquo;Golden Age&rsquo; of hip-hop between the mid-80s and mid-90s, though there are some surprises from a more recent vintage with Kanye West&rsquo;s Pusha T-assisted Runaway taking 12th place. There was a remarkable lack of women in the Top 25; only Queen Latifah&rsquo;s 1993 hit &ldquo;U.N.I.T.Y.&rdquo; and Lauryn Hill&rsquo;s supremely catchy &ldquo;Doo Wop (That Thing)&rdquo; appear in the list.

Havens &ndash; first act at the festival</strong></p><p>Folk artist Richie Havens had been recording well-received albums since the mid-60s, but his star really went ascendant after Woodstock. He was scheduled to be the first to play, but logistical problems meant he was kept on stage again and again as the following acts were delayed. Havens ended up playing for over three hours.</p><p>Near the end, having exhausted his repertoire of songs, Havens started ad-libbing over the old spiritual Motherless Child. &ldquo;I'd already played every song I knew and I was stalling, asking for more guitar and mic, trying to think of something else to play &ndash; and then it just came to me ... The establishment was foolish enough to give us all this freedom and we used it in every way we could,\" he said. The song, Freedom, born on the Woodstock stage, became an icon of 60s counter-culture.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07kcbc5\"}}</p><p><strong>3.30am &ndash; the time Creedence Clearwater Revival played their set</strong></p><p>Creedence may have been the first major act to sign a contract to play the festival, but the honeymoon didn&rsquo;t take long to go sour. Due to the lengthy delays between sets, the band didn&rsquo;t get on stage until after 3am on Sunday, three hours later than originally planned.</p><p>&ldquo;We were ready to rock out and we waited and waited and finally it was our turn ... there were a half million people asleep,&rdquo; frontman John Fogerty told Hank Bordowitz for the book Bad Moon Rising: The Unauthorized History of Creedence Clearwater Revival. &ldquo;These people were out. It was sort of like a painting of a Dante scene, just bodies from hell, all intertwined and asleep, covered with mud. And this is the moment I will never forget as long as I live: A quarter mile away in the darkness, on the other edge of this bowl, there was some guy flicking his Bic, and in the night I hear, 'Don't worry about it, John. We're with you.' I played the rest of the show for that guy.&rdquo;</p><p>The band refused to allow their set to appear in the Woodstock movie, or appear on the live albums until 2019.</p><p><strong>32 -&nbsp; the number of acts who played</strong></p><p>A relatively modest 32 acts played Woodstock, a fraction of the bill that you might find on today&rsquo;s mega festivals such as Glastonbury or Coachella.</p><p>Some of the sets &ndash; Jimi Hendrix. The Who, Janis Joplin, Joe Cocker &ndash; went down in music history. Others &ndash; like Quill, Sha Na Na and Sweetwater &ndash; perhaps spring to mind for only the most devoted.</p><p><strong>Three &ndash; the number of female artists who played</strong></p><p>There&rsquo;s a reason why Sarah MacLachlan et al felt the need to create the 90s female festival Lilith Fair &ndash; women were woefully under-represented in festival culture.</p><p>Woodstock was no different. Of the 32 artists that took part, only three of them were female &ndash; Joan Baez, Janis Joplin and Melanie. The latter almost didn&rsquo;t play &ndash; security didn&rsquo;t think the baby-faced singer was the real deal, and made her sing her song Beautiful People before they would allow her on stage.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07kcb11\"}}</p><p><strong>With A Little Help From My Friends &ndash; Joe Cocker&rsquo;s Beatles cover</strong></p><p>The gravel-voiced British soul singer Joe Cocker&rsquo;s early success was partly thanks to a pair of Beatles covers &ndash; I&rsquo;ll Cry Instead and With A Little Help From My Friends, the latter turned into an epic growlathon perfectly suited to Cocker&rsquo;s tortured baritone.</p><p>The highlight of Cocker&rsquo;s set &ndash; during which he was doused in rainwater as crew cut open the stage roof to prevent it collapsing after a heavy storm &ndash; vies with Jimi Hendrix&rsquo;s set as the most memorable musical moment of the festival.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07kcb99\"}}</p><p><strong>Jeff Beck Group &ndash; booked to play but split before the festival</strong></p><p>Many bands were approached to play the festival but turned it down for various reasons &ndash; Simon and Garfunkel because they were working on a new album, The Doors because they thought it would be a second-rate follow-up to the Monterey Pop Festival.</p><p>The Jeff Beck Group had another reason &ndash; despite being booked to play, the band split just weeks before the festival. \"I deliberately broke the group up before Woodstock,\" frontman Jeff Beck said. \"I didn't want it to be preserved.\" At the very least, this meant that Woodstock missed out on having another rock luminary on stage &ndash; Rod Stewart.</p><p><strong>Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young &ndash; played their second-ever concert</strong></p><p>Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash had only recently added Buffalo Springfield guitar slinger Neil Young to their ranks before they played Woodstock; so recently, in fact, that their set was only their second gig as a four-piece.</p><p>&ldquo;This is only the second time we've performed in front of people,&rdquo; Stephen Stills said to the crowd, as the band were surrounded on the sides of the stage by fellow musicians and industry types. &ldquo;We're scared shitless.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07kcbbp\"}}</p><p><strong>Abbie Hoffman &ndash; stage invader during The Who&rsquo;s set</strong></p><p>The Who&rsquo;s Woodstock set came as the band were promoting Tommy, guitarist Pete Townshend&rsquo;s psychedelic rock opera. The set leaned heavily on Tommy&rsquo;s songs &ndash; but towards the end it featured a standout that was very much spur of the moment.</p><p>As the set drew to a close, Abbie Hoffman &ndash; a political activist &ndash; ran onstage and grabbed a mike, urging support for jailed White Panther member John Sinclair. An incensed Townshend swore at Hoffman and allegedly hit him in the back with his guitar. It&rsquo;s gone down in Woodstock mythology because it was not captured on film (the camera was being reloaded) but the audio was caught, and features on The Who&rsquo;s box-set 30 Years Of Maximum R&amp;B.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07kcbbr\"}}</p><p><strong>Grateful Dead &ndash; didn&rsquo;t allow their set to be released</strong></p><p>There was immense anticipation as The Grateful Dead took to the stage on the second day of the festival; the band&rsquo;s epic, freewheeling jams were perfectly suited to the occasion.</p><p>Unfortunately, the rains that had deluged the site had also visited the stage, and made it an electrical hazard. There were stops and starts aplenty as the band started receiving shocks aplenty. After a long, drawn out jam, full of in-jokes and incoherent humour, the band finally stepped up a gear to finish with a blistering version of Turn On Your Lovelight.</p><p>Frontman Jerry Garcia was philosophical about the near disaster. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to know you can survive as a band even after blowing the biggest gig of your career,&rdquo; he later said. He still didn&rsquo;t allow the gig to be shown in the Woodstock film, however.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07kcbch\"}}</p><p><strong>Jimi Hendrix &ndash; the festival&rsquo;s final act</strong></p><p>For many music fans too young to have wallowed in the mud, Hendrix was the embodiment of Woodstock. His closing set &ndash; taking place at 8am on the Monday, long after the festival was supposed to have finished &ndash; was played to a much smaller crowd than many of the other performers. Many fans had already started their long journeys home.</p><p>Hendrix&rsquo;s backing band for the set was called the Gypsy Suns and Rainbows, which included a second guitarist and two percussionists, as well as ex Jimi Hendrix Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell. The band only lasted three gigs, and rehearsals had been uneven. Demos didn&rsquo;t suggest the gig could be anywhere as good as it was.</p><p>Hendrix&rsquo;s lysergic treatment of the Star Spangled Banner, played in the middle of a 30-minute medley that also included Voodoo Chile and Purple Haze, came to illustrate much of what defined the Woodstock generation &ndash; rebellion against an established order that had taken the US to war in Vietnam and held back civil rights for its black citizens in the South.</p><p>--</p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>The Essential List</em></a><em>.

an age of atomised viewing habits, there are few events that capture as many eyeballs as the Super Bowl. Its ad slots are the most expensive on US terrestrial television &ndash; $5.6m for 30 seconds, thank you very much &ndash; and the Super Bowl Halftime show has become one of the most high-profile gigs of the year.</p><p>Things have come a long way since 1960, when the first Super Bowl Halftime show consisted of nothing more than the standard The Liberty Bell being performed by the University of Arizona Symphonic Marching Band. Today&rsquo;s shows go through as much planning as any set at the Grammys or Oscars.</p><p>This year, Shakira and Jennifer Lopez are gracing the stage at the Hard Rock Stadium at Miami Gardens in Florida. Ostensibly, the crowd are there to see the game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs at Super Bowl LIV, but sometimes the few minutes of music designed for half-time entertainment linger longer in the memory than the games themselves.</p><p>Here, BBC Music looks at 10 of the most memorable performances.</p><p><strong>10. Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, P Diddy, Nelly, Jessica Simpson and Kid Rock (2004)</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p081wh91\"}}</p><p>OK, pub quiz music round time. Can you name the opening song that Jessica Simpson introduced the proceedings to? What song had its name rechanged to namecheck P Diddy? Name either of Kid Rock&rsquo;s two numbers? Nope, us neither. That&rsquo;s because what became the most famous halftime show of all time was overshadowed by a mishap that birthed a whole new phrase in the English language: &ldquo;wardrobe malfunction&rdquo;.</p><p>The halftime show at Houston&rsquo;s Reliant Stadium saw the ensemble, including Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake, rip through 10 tracks on top of the matching band interludes, but its legacy is for one half-second during the denouement, where Jackson and Timberlake teamed up for the latter&rsquo;s Rock Your Body. Which Timberlake did, briefly exposing Jackson&rsquo;s partially-covered right nipple as he ripped off part of her clothing. Fines and lawsuits followed &ldquo;Nipplegate&rdquo;, and Jackson briefly saw her music banned from radio and music video channels around the world because many assumed the incident had been a stunt. Legend has it that a software programmer was so frustrated that he couldn&rsquo;t find footage of the incident online that he invented YouTube.</p><p><strong>9. Michael Jackson (1993)</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p081wh9n\"}}</p><p>Another decade, another Jackson, though this time the wardrobe remained malfunction free. Michael Jackson&rsquo;s 1993 appearance at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California was a turning point in halftime extravaganzas, becoming one of the most-watched events in US history.</p><p>The production began with Jackson appearing on each of the venue&rsquo;s massive jumbotron screens, with stunt doubles then appearing on each of them in a puff of smoke. Jackson himself &ndash; dressed like a Middle Eastern dictator as imagined by the artist Jeff Koons &ndash; then appeared, star jumping up onto the centre of the stage in an entrance of split-second timing, especially considering he sent the following two minutes completely still as the crowd roared their approval. It is peak widescreen Jackson, a stadium-sized segue through Eighties-defining hits (Billie Jean), early 90s anthems (Black Or White) and choir-heavy singalongs (We Are The World, Heal The World).</p><p><strong>8.Lady Gaga (2017)</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p081wh9x\"}}</p><p>American football and Lady Gaga don&rsquo;t seem the most obvious bedfellows, but the Millennial Madonna has earned a formidable reputation for her live shows &ndash; and Superbowl LI got a taste of what her Little Monsters have known for some time: Ain&rsquo;t no show like a Gaga show.</p><p>The beginning saw Gaga performing the US National Anthem from the ramparts of the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, before segueing into Pete Seeger&rsquo;s This Land Is Your Land and the Pledge of Allegiance &ndash; and if all this is sounding mystifyingly middle of the road, bear in mind that behind her, a fleet of some 300 drones were swarming to create a rippling Stars and Stripes flag.</p><p>Gaga then zipwired onto the stage &ndash; very Cirque Du Soleil &ndash; before landing on a tower looking like something left over from the nightmarish cityscape of Blade Runner; the perfect place to then launch into Poker Face. With costuming by Versace and a morphing light show courtesy of awards-show staples 22 Degrees, Gaga&rsquo;s show ended with a Thriller-esque monster mash featuring seemingly zombified football players. That&rsquo;s quite the show to have to follow with a ball game&hellip;</p><p><strong>7. U2 (2002)</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p081whbx\"}}</p><p>No vertigo-inducing zipwires for Bono in 2002 (the song hadn&rsquo;t been released yet). U2&rsquo;s halftime show &ndash; at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans &ndash; the ever-communal U2 opted for the more personal approach. With the rest of the band already on stage, Bono walked through the crowd to the stage to the strains of Beautiful Day.</p><p>This was the first Super Bowl to take place since the September 11 attacks; U2 marked it by showing a scrolling list of names of those who had perished as Bono sprinted around the circular stage to the characteristic chiming guitar of Where the Streets Have No Name. Love them or hate them, U2 know how to turns stadiums into communal services, and this was very much a day at the office.</p><p><strong>6. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band (2009)</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p081whc2\"}}</p><p>Springsteen fans can thank Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, apparently for their Super Bowl appearance. The NFL&rsquo;s head of programming, Charles Coplin, was on a train home after work when an email popped up congratulating him on the Petty show &ndash; from Springsteen&rsquo;s manager Jon Landau. It was more than just viewer feedback &ndash; Landau was testing the water for possibility of The Boss&rsquo;s own halftime show. When I got the note, it was, &lsquo;Wow, they actually like what we do and they&rsquo;re actually interested&rsquo;,&rdquo; Coplin told Rolling Stone in 2009. &ldquo;It was one of the&nbsp;<em>good&nbsp;</em>e-mails.&rdquo;</p><p>And so it was that on 1 February 2009, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band appeared at at the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Bay, Florida, with The Boss thundering into the microphone with all the fire-and-brimstone fervour of a Bible Belt preacher: &ldquo;For the next 12 minutes, we&rsquo;re going to bring the righteous and mighty power of the E Street Band into your beautiful home! I want you to step back from the guacamole dip! I want you to put the chicken fingers down! And turn your television all the way up!&rdquo; No fleets of drones or video trickery, but a band drilled into military tightness. When the band slipped effortlessly into Born To Run, the crowd&rsquo;s roar must have been loud enough to trouble the foundations.</p><p><strong>5. Katy Perry, Lenny Kravitz, and Missy Elliott (2015)</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p081whc5\"}}</p><p>Giant puppet tiger? Check. Alice in Wonderland-style surreal chess board? Check. Dancing beach balls, sharks and palm trees? Check, check, check. No U2-style plug in and play here, though Lenny Kravitz&rsquo;s contribution is the definition of stripped back &ndash; his guitar, leather and jeans in stark contrast to the dayglo lunacy unfolding around him.</p><p>The sudden switch from the Nickelodeon saturation of Teenage Dreams and California Gurls into Missy Elliott&rsquo;s Get Ur Freak On is one of the great mood changes in halftime show history, as the dancing sharks make way for oversized football shirts. The teen pop-meets-retro-rock-meets-hip-hop triumvirate became the most watched half-time show in history &ndash; getting more eyeballs than the game itself.</p><p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Madonna, LMFAO, Nicki Minaj, MIA, Cee Lo Green (2012)</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p081whc6\"}}</p><p>Allusions of grandeur meets moral majority-baiting mischief. Madonna took to the stage at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis flanked by a phalanx of oiled warriors like Cleopatra herself, giant fans revealing her as the intro to Vogue started.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t just the Madonna show, however. Novelty dance act LMFAO, rapper MIA, the then rising hip-hop star Nicki Minaj and the soulful Cee-Lo Green &ndash; as the sweating centurions from the intro would attest &ndash; it takes many hands to support the Material Girl. A decade on from her MTV Video Music Awards controversy, where she kissed Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, Madonna herself swerved away from upsetting the staid stay-at-homes, but MIA couldn&rsquo;t help herself: causing a minor scandal by flipping the bird at the end of her brief guest rap.</p><p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Aerosmith, Britney Spears, 'NSync, Nelly and Mary J Blige (2001)</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p081wh7t\"}}</p><p>Another genre-splicing megafest, throwing together a teen pop titan, the US&rsquo;s closest answer to The Rolling Stones, a rap superstar, a queen of R&amp;B and a five-headed, chart-topping boyband. The intro came on like a possessed jukebox, with 'NSync and Aerosmith trading hits like Bye Bye Bye and Don&rsquo;t Want To Miss A Thing, and with 'NSync no doubt scaring the insurers with some handheld pyrotechnics.</p><p>Things definitely ramped up a notch for the finale, however. For Walk This Way, the supergroup roped in an extra couple of vocalists: Spears and Blige. At some point, amid Joe Perry&rsquo;s guitar fireworks, you fully expected a kitchen sink on the mic next to 'NSync.</p><p><strong>2. Beyonc&eacute; and Destiny&rsquo;s Child (2013)</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p081whcb\"}}</p><p>Quite apart from this being the Super Bowl, Beyonc&eacute; had something to prove. At the press conference for her Super Bowl performance, Queen Bey admitted she had lip-synched at the inauguration of President Barack Obama days earlier. By the time she took the stage at New Orleans&rsquo; Mercedes-Benz Stadium, there was fire in her belly.</p><p>Jay-Z, rumoured to make an appearance at his wife&rsquo;s show, in the end stayed away. This was very much a ladies&rsquo; night, including all the dancers, backing band members and the special guests &ndash; Beyonc&eacute;&rsquo;s former Destiny&rsquo;s Child bandmates, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. Beginning with Bootylicious, the three-song mini-set included them joining forces on Beyonc&eacute;&rsquo;s Run The World. It was a triumphant return after several years all ploughing their own paths, but Beyonc&eacute; also silenced any questions over her live abilities.</p><p><strong>1. Prince (2007)</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p081whcj\"}}</p><p>Most people never realised how much they wanted to hear Prince backed by a marching brass band until the 2007 Super Bowl. The Miami Dolphins&rsquo; stadium was hemmed in by gathering stormy clouds, but that didn&rsquo;t stop Prince taking to his drenched symbol-shaped stage, and signalling his intent by opening with the riff from Queen&rsquo;s We Will Rock You.</p><p>While Prince hurtled into Let&rsquo;s Go Crazy and Baby I&rsquo;m A Star, the Florida A&amp;M University Marching 100 providing a fitting backing band. Prince then deserted his own back catalogue in favour of a trio of songs from other artists &ndash; Creedence Clearwater Revival&rsquo;s Proud Mary, Bob Dylan&rsquo;s All Along The Watchtower, and bringing proceedings more up to date with Foo Fighters&rsquo; Best Of Me.</p><p>The finale, however, couldn&rsquo;t have been timed more perfectly. The heavens opened as Prince closed proceedings with none other than Purple Rain.

When the singer tweeted the poster for the internationally-renowned British weekender in March, fans spotted that she&rsquo;d doctored the original image to promote herself from fifth on the bill to first, leapfrogging headline acts The Killers, The Cure and Stormzy, plus Kylie Minogue, who&rsquo;s playing the Sunday afternoon &lsquo;legends&rsquo; slot.</p><p>It was a brazen and amusing bit of self-aggrandizement from the US star, who is back in the limelight this summer, with her new Las Vegas residency being hailed as a return to &ldquo;<a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/music/news/janet-jackson-park-mgm-las-vegas-residency-concert-review-1203219810/\">top</a> <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/music/news/janet-jackson-park-mgm-las-vegas-residency-concert-review-1203219810/\">form&rdquo;</a> when it began last month. But many fans felt it was more than justified. For, despite a glittering career that includes 10 US number one hits, estimated global record sales totalling 100 million, and a recent induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Janet remains a strangely underrated pop icon.</p><p>More like this</p><p>- <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190618-how-pop-culture-embraced-sexuality-without-labels\">How pop culture embraced sexuality without labels</a></p><p>- <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190606-the-films-that-defined-generation-x\">The films that defined Generation X</a></p><p>- <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190610-did-manga-shape-how-the-world-sees-japan\">Did manga shape how the world sees Japan?</a></p><p>Janet&rsquo;s iconic career is especially impressive because it&rsquo;s involved having to emerge from the shadow of a wildly successful older sibling. When she dropped her eponymous debut album in September 1982, Michael Jackson was just months away from unleashing Thriller, the pop culture phenomenon that became the best-selling album of all time.</p><p>Performing as the Jackson Five, Janet&rsquo;s brothers had been a popular act since the early '70s, and being a Jackson surely gave Janet a head start in the highly competitive music industry. But it didn&rsquo;t guarantee her a hit: neither 1982&rsquo;s forgettable Janet Jackson album nor 1984&rsquo;s slightly stronger follow-up Dream Street,which includes an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKe-mzwTMY8\">almost-quaint duet with British pop legend Cliff Richard</a>, sold very well. Their largely characterless blend of contemporary pop sounds offered few clues that by the mid-90s, Janet would be the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-01-12-mn-23892-story.html\">highest-paid recording artist in history</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07dyn5h\"}}</p><p>Janet&rsquo;s creative and commercial breakthrough came in 1986, when she teamed up with Minneapolis-based producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to make Control, a game-changing dance-pop-R&amp;B album that paved the way for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_jack_swing\">new jack swing sound</a> of the late-'80s. When Janet declared &ldquo;this time, I&rsquo;m gonna do it my way,&rdquo; on the title track, she meant it: Jam and Lewis&rsquo;s sleek, teak-tough beats gave her a state-of-the-art platform to establish her own powerful pop persona &ndash; that of a strong, self-assured young woman who had no time for &ldquo;nasty boys&rdquo;. Then, with 1989&rsquo;s formidableJanet Jackson&rsquo;s Rhythm Nation 1814 album, she became more overtly political. \"Join voices in protest to social injustice,\" she sang on the title track. \"A generation full of courage, come forth with me.\"</p><blockquote><p> &nbsp;Long before Beyonc&eacute;, Janet was exploring how navigating the world as a black woman is never not political &ndash; Dr Kirsty Fairclough </p></blockquote><p>\"Long before Beyonc&eacute; was flashing the word 'feminist' in the background while performing on stage, Janet was exploring how navigating the world as a black woman is never not political,\" says Dr Kirsty Fairclough from the School of Arts and Media at the University of Salford. \"Her music and image melded to explicitly address racism and sexism with songs about trying to flourish as a person in an environment ruled by both. In a 1987 interview following the release of Control, Jackson responded to a question about being a feminist by saying, 'If it&rsquo;s someone, a woman, who&rsquo;s taking control of her life as well as her career, then I say that I am a feminist.'\"</p><p>These two albums contain some of Janet&rsquo;s most enduring songs, including What Have You Done for Me Lately?, Escapade and Nasty, on which she delivers an iconic rebuke to disrespectful males: &ldquo;No, my first name ain&rsquo;t baby &ndash; it&rsquo;s Janet, Miss Jackson if you&rsquo;re nasty.&rdquo; They also established her as one of the most dynamic music video creators of all time. When I Think of You is a joyous homage to old-school Hollywood musicals directed by Absolute Beginners&rsquo; Julien Temple; The Pleasure Principle contains a dazzling dance performance from Janet that peaks with a famous chair sequence that <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1626492/20091117/spears_britney.jhtml\">Britney Spears referenced in her 2000 video for Stronger</a>.</p><p><strong>A sexually-liberated trailblazer</strong></p><p>Subsequent albums such as 1993&rsquo;s janet and 1997&rsquo;s The Velvet Rope found her fully embracing her sexuality in a way that still feels groundbreaking today. Her 1993 single If is a heady sexual fantasy whose video has been praised for portraying interracial lust. &ldquo;There are songs on The Velvet Rope that would make Beyonc&eacute; in [sexually-charged] Partition mode blush,&rdquo; BBC Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo tells BBC Culture. &ldquo;Her unashamed sexual liberation, especially for black women, is something that's still so taboo.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07dyn7v\"}}</p><p>At the same time, musically, she began to shift into seductive, slow-burn R&amp;B &ndash; see brilliant '90s singles such as the Grammy-winning That&rsquo;s the Way Love Goes and Joni Mitchell-sampling Got &lsquo;til It&rsquo;s Gone. But even then, she never abandoned the dancefloor. Two of her biggest mid-career hits were 1997&rsquo;s Together Again, a poignant house-pop track inspired by a friend she lost to Aids, which cemented her status as an LGBT icon, and 2001&rsquo;s All for You, an irresistible neo-disco song that spent seven weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>Janet collaborated almost exclusively with Jam and Lewis until 2004&rsquo;s Damita Jo album, which also included contributions from several other producers including Kanye West. Amfo notes that &ldquo;her consistency in working with the same producers allowed her to hone a sound that is so distinctively her&rdquo;. Damita Jo became Janet&rsquo;s first commercial disappointment since 1984, failing to top the Billboard 200 chart or to yield a sizeable hit single.</p><p><strong>Super Bowl sexism</strong></p><p>The album arrived just two months after one of the most notorious moments of her career: the so-called &lsquo;wardrobe malfunction&rsquo; during her performance with Justin Timberlake at the 2004 Super Bowl Halftime Show, which saw her breast briefly visible on live TV. Both artists said afterwards that the idea was simply for Timberlake to rip away Janet&rsquo;s leather bustier to reveal a red lace bra underneath, but that the &lsquo;malfunction&rsquo; caused her entire breast to be exposed.</p><blockquote><p> Though her nipple was only exposed for about half a second, the incident brought back into popular consciousness a long-held negative trope surrounding black female sexuality &ndash; Dr Kirsty Fairclough </p></blockquote><p>The incident caused a global furore: Michael Powell, chairman of US media regulator the Federal Communications Commission, told a Senate panel that it was \"a new low for prime time television\". Though &lsquo;Janet Jackson&rsquo; became the most searched-for person on the internet that year, her reputation was instantly tarnished. Walt Disney World even <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2004/03/03/disney-world-removes-janet-jackson-inspired-statue/\">decided to remove</a> &nbsp;a life-size statue of Mickey Mouse dressed in her signature Rhythm Nation outfit.</p><p>Last year a <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/les-moonves-janet-jackson-career_n_5b919b8ce4b0511db3e0a269\">report</a> alleged that after the incident, Les Moonves, the chairman and CEO of CBS, which screened the Super Bowl, became &ldquo;fixated&rdquo; with derailing her career and effectively blacklisted her from Viacom channels including MTV. Moonves, who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46599490\">stepped down from the network in September 2018 following accusations of sexual harassment and abuse</a>, is said to have been incensed because he believed the incident was a deliberate attempt to whip up controversy that Janet had not shown enough remorse for.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07dyn6h\"}}</p><p>Whatever the truth behind this allegation, there&rsquo;s no doubting that it affected her career in a way that Timberlake, who was equally involved in the incident, largely managed to escape. &ldquo;Though her nipple was only exposed for about half a second, what the incident triggered was to bring back into popular consciousness a long-held negative trope surrounding black female sexuality,&rdquo; Fairclough says. &ldquo;This is essentially the idea that black women are &lsquo;dangerous&rsquo; and &lsquo;irrational&rsquo; sexual beings that must be controlled. Her career in the mainstream has never fully recovered since this moment.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The Janet revival </strong></p><p>But in recent years, Janet&rsquo;s reputation has definitely enjoyed a revival. Her 2015 album Unbreakable debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and her recent tours have won appreciative reviews. &ldquo;When [acclaimed French singer-songwriter] Christine and the Queens did a segment on my radio show called Your Song [in which guests select a song that is special to them], she chose Janet&rsquo;s The Pleasure Principle and she was just so elated when she was speaking about it,&rdquo; says Clara Amfo. &ldquo;Janet has and continues to be a template for so many artists: Christine, Ciara, fellow Glastonbury performer Janelle Mon&aacute;e, MNEK, Beyonc&eacute;, the list goes on.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> Her talent gets overshadowed because she&rsquo;s the &lsquo;baby Jackson&rsquo;, but it is her own, outside of her family &ndash; MNEK </p></blockquote><p>Indeed, British artist-producer MNEK tells BBC Culture enthusiastically: &ldquo;Janet&rsquo;s songwriting and performing has always been so sophisticated. I&rsquo;ve always admired her showmanship and how she was able to wrap lyrics with her voice in such a smooth way. [Some] people say her voice is too soft or that she can&rsquo;t sing, but this obviously isn&rsquo;t true. Janet has actually got a beautiful voice.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><br /> </strong>MNEK also praises Janet for &ldquo;really drilling in the importance of albums to the public &ndash; that gets overshadowed because she&rsquo;s the &lsquo;baby Jackson&rsquo;, but her talent is her own, outside of being a Jackson&rdquo;. Amfo goes a step further, saying that a key part of Janet&rsquo;s legacy lies in inspiring others by &ldquo;gaining independence from a family with an overbearing history&rdquo;. Sadly, it&rsquo;s arguable that this family history continues to cast a shadow on Janet&rsquo;s individual achievements. Dr Kirsty Fairclough says that historical sexual abuse allegations levelled at Michael Jackson in this year&rsquo;s documentary Leaving Neverland &ldquo;inevitably influences mainstream coverage of Janet and her family&rdquo;.</p><p>Janet&rsquo;s new Las Vegas show, Janet Jackson: Metamorphosis, begins with a performance of Empty, an excellent trip-hop-inflected track from The Velvet Rope. Released 22 years ago, its lyrics seem to have anticipated society&rsquo;s growing reliance on online relationships. &ldquo;Is this a new way to love? Never face to face, is it enough?&rdquo; Janet ponders. Her revival of this very prescient song in 2019 reflects how, knockbacks notwithstanding, Janet remains supremely capable of stewarding her own legacy, and doing so smartly. This weekend&rsquo;s Glastonbury set gives her a welcome opportunity to remind us that she&rsquo;s one of her generation&rsquo;s most thrilling and visionary performers.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><em>&nbsp;page or message us on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>And if you liked this story,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><strong>sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</strong></a><em>, called The Essential List.

Win this, and you join a hallowed hall featuring songs from only the most respected songwriters of the modern era: The Beatles, Frank Sinatra, Elton John and, er, The Doobie Brothers (well, it was the end of the Seventies).</p><p>The Grammys recognition of the greatest song of the year is a little more complicated than most awards. Song Of The Year rewards the songwriters who wrote and composed the song, but the awards also have Record Of The Year, a prize that goes to the singer and production team.</p><p>Last year, This Is America by Childish Gambino won the Song Of The Year award, this year the nominations are:</p><p>Always Remember Us This Way (Lady Gaga)<br /> Bad Guy (Billie Eilish)<br /> Bring My Flowers Now (Tanya Tucker)<br /> Hard Place (H.E.R.)<br /> Lover (Taylor Swift)<br /> Norman F***ing Rockwell (Lana Del Rey)<br /> Someone You Loved (Lewis Capaldi)<br /> Truth Hurts (Lizzo)</p><p>For 60 years the Song Of The Year category has rewarded songs that have become part of our aural history. It&rsquo;s also thrown up some mystifying decisions too. Ahead of the ceremony this year, here&rsquo;s BBC Music&rsquo;s potted history of the the Song Of The Year award in 14 facts. [Note: the years cited are those in which the songs were released and were awarded for, not the year the ceremony took place, which is the following year.]</p><p><strong>The first Song Of The Year was in Italian<br /> </strong>The US music industry is big and broad enough to have overwhelmingly swelled the ranks of Song Of The year winners. But when the category kicked off in 1959, the Grammy Awards judges gave the prize to Domenico Modugno&rsquo;s Volare. The song had already been Italy&rsquo;s entry into the Eurovision Song Contest in 1958 and spent five weeks at the top of the Billboard charts, turning Modugno into a household name. Modugno, incidentally, later became a member of parliament in Italy and an outspoken critic of Chilean dictator August Pinochet &ndash; so much so that he was denied entry to Chile to play a concert.</p><p><strong>Jimmy Webb&rsquo;s surprising win</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08137vx\"}}</p><p>Jimmy Webb&rsquo;s By the Time I Get To Phoenix is regarded as one of the classic songs of the 1960s, made even more memorable by the honeyed tones of the late Glen Campbell. The Grammy panel rightly gave it a nomination for best song in 1967, but the song was beaten by Up, Up And Away &ndash; also written by Webb. Thus, The 5th Dimension&rsquo;s ode to hot-air ballooning made it into the Grammy history books, instead of one of the greatest essays of romantic longing ever recorded.</p><p><strong>Little Green Apples beats The Beatles<br /> </strong>Bobby Russell&rsquo;s Little Green Apples is a masterpiece of lyrical songwriting; the kind of country song that makes you feel you&rsquo;re right in the room with the characters. It was originally recorded by country legend Roger Miller, though the song&rsquo;s confessional approach meant other singers soon clamoured to cover it. Patti Page and OC Smith both covered it in 1968, and Smith&rsquo;s version earned Russell the Song Of The Year Grammy. Some might have thought that another song that made the category that year might have triumphed, however The Beatles&rsquo; Hey Jude missed out.</p><p><strong>The Beatles won only once</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08137jj\"}}</p><p>In fact, though Lennon and McCartney may arguably be the most successful songwriting partnership in pop history, nods from the Grammy judges were conspicuous by their absence. The band won only once, for the song Michelle, off the album Rubber Soul. The choice was all the more interesting given that the song wasn&rsquo;t released as a single, and the album never topped the charts in the US (though Michelle was the most popular Rubber Soul track on US radio).</p><p><strong>Playing it safe in the &lsquo;70s<br /> </strong>Halfway through the 1970s, the Grammy judges still seemed to be keeping modern pop at arm&rsquo;s length, celebrating instead the folkier charms of Simon &amp; Garfunkel and the can-you-hear-me-at-the-back music hall projection of Barbra Streisand. 1975 was a year which saw a string of pop classics &ndash; from The Bee Gees&rsquo; Jive Talkin&rsquo; to KC &amp; The Sunshine Band&rsquo;s Get Down Tonight and David Bowie&rsquo;s extraordinary Fame. What did the jury go for? Judy Collins&rsquo; Send In The Clowns.</p><p><strong>No place for Bond</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08137n5\"}}</p><p>Say what you like about the James Bond films, but they have directly birthed a handful of fantastic pop songs, including Wings&rsquo; Live &amp; Let Die and Louis Armstrong&rsquo;s velvet-smooth We Have All The Time In The World. But one &ndash; and only one &ndash; has earned a nomination for Song Of The Year. Carly Simon&rsquo;s Nobody Does It Better was the theme to 1977&rsquo;s The Spy Who Loved Me, written by composer Marvin Hamlisch and lyricist Carole Bayer Sager. It lost out, however, to two another compositions for films &ndash; Evergreen (the theme to A Star Is Born) and You Light Up My Life, from the film of the same name. Incidentally, that&rsquo;s the only time two songs have shared the prize.</p><p><strong>Doobie Bother</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p081382r\"}}</p><p>Jimmy Webb wasn&rsquo;t the only artist to enjoy a double nomination. The Doobie Brothers&rsquo; Michael McDonald also found himself up for the award twice in the same year, though with two different writing partners. Studio Doobie Lester Abrams co-wrote the single Minute By Minute with McDonald, but a place on the podium was assured thanks to the latter&rsquo;s song with Kenny Loggins, What A Fool Believes.</p><p><strong>No song success for Jackson </strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08137qv\"}}</p><p>Few &rsquo;80s artists apart from Madonna and Prince could hold a candle to Michael Jackson, but despite his chart-topping domination, neither he nor his songwriting partners had even a sniff of songwriting success during the 80s &ndash; apart from Jackson&rsquo;s part in the Ethiopia famine charity single We Are The World, with Jackson co-credited alongside Lionel Richie. There was more to be thankful for in the Record Of The Year category at least: Beat It won the category for 1983, and Thriller also won Album Of The Year.</p><p><strong>Bette Midler&rsquo;s double run</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08138y6\"}}</p><p>Think of 1989 and a clutch of classic singles spring to mind &ndash; Madonna&rsquo;s Like A Prayer, The B-52s&rsquo; Love Shack, Cher&rsquo;s Turn Back Time and Soul II Soul&rsquo;s Back To Life, to name but a few. What did the Grammy judges plump for? Seemingly possessed by the spirit of a Broadway theatrical agent, the Grammy panel rewarded Bette Midler&rsquo;s Wind Beneath My Wings, and followed it up a year later with another prize, this time for the equally maudlin From A Distance. In generations to come, music historians may come up with the idea that Midler was the female pre-eminent pop artist of the &rsquo;80s. It&rsquo;s as if Madonna never happened.</p><p><strong>The year music went to the movies</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08137pz\"}}</p><p>Music and movies have always gone hand in hand, and the Grammys and the Oscars have been regular dance partners. But 1994 was noteworthy even amid Hollywood themes to shoehorn their way into the proceedings. That year, no less than three of the songs in contention for the prize were from films. The Lion King soundtrack gave Elton John and Tim Rice two nods for the songs Circle Of Life and Can You Feel The Love, but victory went instead to Bruce Springsteen for the downbeat Streets Of Philadelphia.</p><p><strong>Illustrious omissions</strong><br /> Given that the Grammy&rsquo;s have a public reputation of largely rewarding commercial rather than critical success, it&rsquo;s odd that several of the pop world&rsquo;s biggest artists have never been recognised &ndash; or even nominated. The Rolling Stones, Madonna, David Bowie and Queen have never even been nominated, while Prince&rsquo;s one nomination was for Sinead O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s version of Nothing Compares To You.</p><p><strong>Beautiful day for U2</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08137kx\"}}</p><p>U2, on the other hand, were nominated in 1987 for I Still Haven&rsquo;t Found What I&rsquo;m Looking For, though the Linda Ronstadt/James Ingram duet Somewhere Out There ultimately proved the winner. But U2&rsquo;s day would come in the 2000s, with a double whammy five years apart. Beautiful Day &ndash; widely regarded as something of a commercial return to form after the dance rock antics half a decade earlier &ndash; took the honours for 2000, and five years later they followed it up with another for Sometimes You Can&rsquo;t Make It On Your Own. Some things truly do come to those who wait.</p><p><strong>Seven&rsquo;s up for songwriters</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p08138dq\"}}</p><p>Songwriting often demands company &ndash; bouncing ideas off each other, helping songs take shape from those sparks of inspiration. But pity whoever had to pay the pizza bill for the songwriting session that birthed Bruno Mars&rsquo; That&rsquo;s What I Like, which took the award for 2017. No less than seven writers &ndash; including Mars himself &ndash; contributed, a record that will likely take some beating. The most songwriters in this year&rsquo;s nominations are five &ndash; for Hard Place by H.E.R. and Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi.</p><p><strong>Growing choice for the award<br /> </strong>When the category was invented only five songs went head-to-head. Nowadays &ndash; possibly because our streaming and download culture now favours the song over the album &ndash; this year&rsquo;s prize is now contested by eight songs.

Spotify launched in the US, as well as Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music and a Jay-Z-rebranded Tidal, and streaming figures became included in the singles and album charts. Social media broke down walls by creating direct lines of communication between artists and fans, with followers, memes and challenges on YouTube, Instagram and more recently TikTok becoming a crucial window for both fans and A&amp;R departments.</p><p>As a result, it was a time in which music became truly global, and genres seemed to mutate and fuse. Latin and K-pop became established as major genres, EDM entered the mainstream. Hip-hop was elevated to a new level, outselling rock music for the first time, and saw subgenres like trap and SoundCloud rap acheiving mainstream success. The 2010s was also bookended by two young female artists &ndash; Adele and Billie Eilish &ndash; who in their own way personified the present and future of popular music.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s our year-by-year guide to the songs we think perhaps best defined the 2010s. These aren&rsquo;t necessarily our favourite songs, or the best-selling songs, but the songs that helped define the soundtrack to the last 10 years. Listen to all the picks on our <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1am1xJwhCyqe5t730Lv5ip\" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7sKYsVBRr16OzLnYFqD8JM?si=bR44Pq4TQ3OKplY-opSrgg\">Spotify playlist here</a>.</p><p><strong>2010<br /> A-side: Adele, Rolling in the Deep</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6v7j\"}}</p><p>Apparently, Adele's 21 or 19 albums were so popular in the UK that at one stage a copy was sold every 7 seconds. Given how quickly this song became inescapable &ndash; blaring out from wine bars, TVs, and the rolled-up windows of countless school runs &ndash; it&rsquo;s remarkable just how odd Adele&rsquo;s Rolling In The Deep is. A four-to-the-floor broadside from a woman scorned, the song unleashed a Delta Blues howl that the young Brit had barely hinted at, and that propelled her to the top of the charts worldwide. But it&rsquo;s the backing vocals that elevate this to something extraordinary &ndash; cold and judgemental, where you might have expected warmth and heartfelt harmony. It&rsquo;s a masterpiece of subverting a classic, timeless form.</p><p><strong>B-side: Robyn, Dancing On My Own<br /> </strong>One of the decade&rsquo;s great disco bangers, this has remained a high mark in Robyn&rsquo;s career so far. The first of her songs to top the charts in her native Sweden, the song was a bittersweet, voyeuristic narrative, a woman dancing alone in a crowded club while her ex and his new lover look on. It may have sounded, on the surface, life-affirming, but this was bleak, wounded pop of the highest order, and set the template for a certain brand of female empowerment through angst for the rest of the decade.</p><p><strong>2011<br /> A-side: Lana Del Rey, Video Games</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07yqwvp\"}}</p><p>Lizzy Grant was dead. Long live Lana Del Ray. Grant had played New York clubs for years under her own name, releasing a single album that sank without trace. A name change signalled a Year Zero. Out went casual clothes and a shy onstage persona &ndash; in came widescreen Sixties drama, dressed up like a glamorous gangster&rsquo;s wife on the brink of a biblical fall. For all the accusations of artifice and manufacturing (Del Ray was accused of being a record company puppet), this homage to a sordid, swinging 60s was feverishly cinematic.</p><p><strong>B-side: Rebecca Black, Friday<br /> </strong>Self-recorded tracks existed long before the internet &ndash; in the 1950s, you could have your own records pressed after warbling to your heart&rsquo;s content inside a vocal booth (Elvis Presley was signed after doing just that at Sun Records in Memphis in the 1950s). Rebecca Black only updated the tradition for the social media age. For the princely sum of $4,000, Black&rsquo;s parents created an unwitting, auto-tuned popstar, a 13-year-old girl whose beyond-innocent tribute to the end of the week went viral &ndash; more than 167 million views on YouTube in the first four months alone. The other side of social media success reared its ugly head too: Black faced an onslaught of cyberbullying with people calling it &ldquo;the worst song ever&rdquo; and creating a seemingly never-ending series of parodies.</p><p><strong>2012<br /> A-side: Psy, Gangnam Style</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6vnx\"}}</p><p>In Korean, it means &ldquo;south of the river&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s regarded as the South Korean Beverley Hills, and home to some of the world&rsquo;s priciest real estate. It even hosted the G:20 conference in 2011. But this isn&rsquo;t why you know Gangnam. In 2012, Korean rapper Psy made this affluent stretch of Seoul as well-known to pop music as London, New York, Paris, Munich. The first globe-swallowing K-pop hit, Gangnam Style made Psy &ndash; the antithesis of the chiselled, good looking K-pop pin-up &ndash; into a viral star the world over. Let&rsquo;s face it, you can still do the dance.</p><p><strong>B-side: Lorde, Royals<br /> </strong>Global popstars &ndash; with apologies to one Neil Finn &ndash; don&rsquo;t tend to come from New Zealand. That all changed with the arrival of Lorde, a teenage singer-songwriter whose development had been nurtured by a local A&amp;R since she was 12. Though the song would become a worldwide hit in 2013, it first emerged &ndash; free to download &ndash; on SoundCloud towards the end of 2012. It was the 17-year-old&rsquo;s reaction to seeing conspicuous consumption in hip-hop videos and hearing a laundry list of luxury brands on rap songs, a realisation that the world you&rsquo;re being sold is make believe. It&rsquo;s minimal production created the blueprint for the &ldquo;cutting-edge&rdquo; sound of pop, and set the scene for other global successes like Taylor Swift blockbuster <em>1989</em> album.</p><p><strong>2013<br /> A-side: Daft Punk, Get Lucky ft Pharrell Williams, Nile Rodgers<br /></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6w2f\"}}</p><p>Before Get Lucky, Daft Punk had had a relatively quiet decade &ndash; their 2005 album Human After All attracted lacklustre reviews after the well-received Discovery (2001). The duo put their robotic heads down and toured for a couple of years&hellip; and then went silent. It was only in 2013 that a new song appeared. Daft Punk had met former Chic legend Nile Rodgers at a listening party in 1997, and more than a decade-and-a-half later, Rodgers would be instrumental in making their disco-flavoured Get Lucky the song of the summer. It&rsquo;s not just down to Rodgers, either &ndash; Get Lucky&rsquo;s sinuous melodies are ever sweeter thanks to the vocals of Pharrell Williams, who had quite the year&hellip;</p><p><strong>B-side: Robin Thicke, Blurred Lines ft. TI + Pharrell<br /> </strong>A song made famous thanks to 1) a video which left little to the imagination and 2) a court case involving the mischievous lifting of one of Marvin Gaye&rsquo;s most irresistible hooks. Robin Thicke&rsquo;s song was one of three massive hits featuring Pharrell that year (see also Get Lucky and the Despicable Me 2-featured super smash Happy). The topless version of the video for Blurred Lines was removed from YouTube after only a week but it only served to add to the song&rsquo;s lustre. The line &ldquo;I know you want it&rdquo; only served to cause further issue as the #MeToo movement began to grow, causing it to be banned at student discos in the UK. Worse for Thicke and Williams was to come, when Marvin Gaye&rsquo;s estate sued claiming the track had pilfered from the club classic Got To Get It On. The case went to trial and in 2015 the pair were found guilty of copyright infringement by a jury in 2015; the song had not sampled Gaye&rsquo;s tune, but was found to have copied the feel of it &ndash; a seismic change in copyright claims which has huge implications for the industry.</p><p><strong>2014<br /> A-side: Mark Ronson, Uptown Funk ft. Bruno Mars<br /></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6w8q\"}}</p><p>Ever imagined what an updated version of Was Not Was&rsquo;s Walk The Dinosaur might sound like? Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson might have pondered that very same thought. 2014&rsquo;s least subtle singalong &ndash; at some point you can probably hear the moment a kitchen sink is thrown into the mix &ndash; Uptown Funk kisses itself at its prettiness and sweeps all before it with a seemingly unstoppable escalation. It&rsquo;s as if two bands had an arms race over who could create the most worthy descendant of The Gap Band&rsquo;s Oops Upside Your Head, and this was the end result.</p><p><strong>B-side: Meghan Trainor, All About That Bass<br /> </strong>A paean to the bottom end, just not the kind of bottom end audiophiles are usually obsessed with. Trainor was not a pop star herself, but a writer for hire when she penned the track, a collaboration with Kevin Kadish that took all of 40 minutes. Borrowing some of the tropes of doo-wop (Trainor had been a fan since she was introduced to it by her father), the soca-flavoured song is a no-description-spared celebration of the fuller figure.</p><p><strong>2015<br /> A-side: BTS, I Need U</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6wbw\"}}</p><p>It&rsquo;s the pop equivalent of the Marvel Universe. When it comes to immersing their fans in a manufactured world, few bands can match the creative vision of K-pop sensations BTS. I Need U, from their second album The Most Beautiful Moment In Life Part 2, was an electro-pop sideways move for the South Korean seven-piece, and a snapshot of the wider story the band teased out over the course of the album&rsquo;s life, through music videos, social media posts, album art and comics. In due course, K-pop and BTS in particular would become a sensation not just in South East Asia but across the world.</p><p><strong>B-side: Kendrick Lamar, Alright<br /> </strong>&ldquo;We gon&rsquo; be alright.&rdquo; The simplest of choruses, turned into an anthem for a new civil rights movement. Inspired by a trip Lamar took to South Africa, the rapper fused beats provided by man-of-the-decade Pharrell with a wake-up call for black youth, recognising the struggle from generations past was still not done. It gained further credence when that five-syllable chorus became a chant at Black Lives Matter rallies. &ldquo;We gon&rsquo; be alright&rdquo; became less a throwaway optimistic catchphrase, and more than act of defiance.</p><p><strong>2016<br /> A-side: Beyonc&eacute;, Formation</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6wg9\"}}</p><p>Beyonce&rsquo;s sixth album Lemonade broke the mould when it was released with absolutely no advanced notice. The lead single Formation was an intense, uncompromising expression of both blackness and Southern-ness, the latter something Queen Bey had often been accused of forgetting by detractors. The opening verse is unequivocal, laying waste to online gossip (&ldquo;Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess&rdquo;) before unfurling a <em>different</em> kind of Southern flag a few lines later (&ldquo;My daddy Alabama / Momma Louisiana&rdquo;). The beats were insistent, almost martial; this was a Black Power anthem musically stripped back but a lyrical <em>tour de force.</em></p><p><strong>B-side: Billie Eilish, ocean eyes<br /> </strong>Eilish came out of the blocks with real intent: Ocean Eyes was her first song, written by her older brother Finneas O&rsquo;Connell, ostensibly for his band. First released on SoundCloud in November 2015, the song helped create a buzz about Eilish when she was still only 13, the lack of record company involvement making her feel like a genuine discovery. The lyrics made an instant impression, drawing parallels to Lorde: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stop staring at those ocean skies / Burning cities and napalm skies / Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes.&rdquo; By the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191220-the-20-best-songs-of-2019\">end of the decade</a>, Eilish would become one of the defining stars of pop music.</p><p><strong>2017<br /> A-side: Luis Fonsi, Despacito ft. Daddy Yankee</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6wn5\"}}</p><p>From the Amazon to the Arctic Circle, Greenland to the Galapagos, this was the song of 2017. A collaboration between Puerto Ricans Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, the song&rsquo;s remix added Justin Bieber into the mix &ndash; and made this song the biggest Latin smash since Macarena, some 20 years before. What was an otherwise inoffensive urban-inflected pop song, mostly sung in Spanish, instead became a battering ram that broke down the barriers that had kept Latino pop off English-speaking airwaves; they now call it &ldquo;the Despacito effect&rdquo;, and the likes of Demi Lovato and Camila Cabello have followed in its wake.</p><p><strong>B-side: Ed Sheeran, Shape Of You<br /> </strong>In the UK, you know you&rsquo;ve made it when your song in used in an advert for middle class supermarket Marks &amp; Spencers. Such was the ubiquity of Shape Of You. Sheeran was already big &ndash; stadium-filling big &ndash; by the time Shape Of You shimmied its sinuous hips across the world&rsquo;s speakers in 2017. Inspired by TLC&rsquo;s No Scrubs (that tune&rsquo;s writers also get a nod on the credits) the song went on to become the biggest-selling single of 2017, and in 2018 became the first track to break two billion plays on streaming service Spotify. Originally conceived as a duet between Rihanna and rap star Rudimental, the head of Sheeran&rsquo;s label convinced him to keep the track for himself.</p><p><strong>2018<br /> A-side: Childish Gambino, This Is America</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z6wpc\"}}</p><p>Polymath Donald Glover (aka Childish Gambino) was starring in an episode of Saturday Night Live when the video for This Is America dropped (by then he&rsquo;s already appeared in the Star Wars spin-off Solo: A Star Wars Story). He&rsquo;d already produced a string of albums and singles, but some reviewers wondered out loud whether Glover was too busy being an actor, comedian and DJ to come up with a proper hit. Well, that changed with This Is America and its video, a film so stacked with allusions to black life in 21st Century America that it required several viewings. A visceral diatribe against American gun culture, the video is so stuffed with visual information &ndash; especially the nods to police prejudice against black Americans &ndash; it takes several views to full take in.</p><p><strong>B-side: Ariana Grande: no tears left to cry<br /> </strong>The American singer/songwriter hadn&rsquo;t quite made the jump from star to superstardom, when her 2017 Manchester Arena concert was the target of a suicide bombing. Grande suspended the remainder of the tour and held the One Love Manchester tribute concert a few weeks later. Grande seemed to channel trauma in real time on her next album, covering her post-traumatic stress after Manchester and struggles with break-ups in an empowering way. no tears left to cry was the first single released, with the music video featuring a bee &ndash; the symbol of Manchester &ndash; an acknowledgement of strength through togetherness. Our resilience was Ari&rsquo;s, and Ari&rsquo;s resilience was ours.</p><p><strong>2019<br /> A-side: Lil&rsquo; Nas X, Old Town Road ft. Billy Ray Cyrus<br /></strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07z80hp\"}}</p><p>The instrumental version of this song was released in 2018, the work of Dutch beat producer YoungKio. But it would go overground thanks to a marrying of genres that still causes headscratching to this day. Rapper Lil&rsquo; Nas X snapped up the beats &ndash; which sampled banjo from a Nine Inch Nails instrumental &ndash; and bought the rights to the song for just $30; he wrote the lyrics, inspired by the tough times he was going through, in just a day. Old Town Road initially met some resistance from the country crowd; Billboard disqualified it from its country charts because it felt the song wasn&rsquo;t country enough. But Old Town Road was not to be stopped; a remix version featuring Achy Breaky Heart hitmaker Billy Ray Cyrus helped propel the song into the stratosphere. Old Town Road ended up marking 19 weeks at the top of the US charts, a record. And it broke ground for other reasons, too. Lil Nas X (real name Montero Lamar Hill) came out as gay while the record was still number one in the US, becoming the only artist in history to do so.</p><p><strong>B-side: Lizzo, Juice<br /> </strong>It could have been a classic beamed straight from the mirrorball reflected dancefloors of the early 1980s &ndash; but no, Lizzo&rsquo;s Juice was a fresh hit from 2019, the anthem for a thousand body-positive Instagram posts. The song Truth Hurts had been a sleeper hit in 2018, but it was a sinker compared to Juice; a bold as brass self-love anthem about as subtle as a Transformers film. Juice&rsquo;s mile-high chorus (&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t my fault that I'm out here gettin&rsquo; loose/ Gotta blame it on the Goose/ Gotta blame it on my juice, baby&rdquo;) was as infectious as any in living memory.</p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>The Essential List</em></a><em>.

spat out by the group&rsquo;s rapper Melo. &ldquo;But if any politicians try to shut me up, I&rsquo;ll cut off their heads and lay them at their corpses&rsquo; feet. This time it&rsquo;s Uber that&rsquo;s investigated. Next time it will be you.&rdquo; It led to the song being blocked by Chinese censors, and Melo called in for questioning by the local Public Security Bureau.</p><p>Since then, Higher Brothers have garnered widespread success both at home and abroad, partly thanks to landing their first American tour to promote their album Journey To The West. Alongside many of China&rsquo;s rising crop of hip-hop artists, they&rsquo;ve stormed onto both the local and global stage &ndash; and largely steered clear of politics.</p><p>Until now. Over the course of the summer, as the Hong Kong protests have unfolded, and as geopolitical climes have chilled both at home and abroad, many of China&rsquo;s rappers have decided to voice their politics.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07t1wrd\"}}</p><p>But in stark contrast to the longstanding tradition of counter-culturalism and racial protest that has defined American hip-hop, the politics these rappers are asserting has a distinctly, one-noted nationalist tone.</p><p>In response to the protests, Melo <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1INtgtB50z/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=dlfix\">posted</a> a picture of the Chinese national flag on his social media accounts with the caption: &ldquo;Once again, I&rsquo;m proud to be Chinese.&rdquo; The rapper CD Rev released a <a href=\"https://radiichina.com/communist-rappers-cd-rev-drop-new-song-about-hong-kong-featuring-donald-trump/\">diss track</a> titled Hong Kong&rsquo;s Fall. Jackson Wang, a Hong Kong-born artist, <a href=\"https://supchina.com/2019/08/16/hong-kong-jackson-wang-pulls-out-of-88rising-festival-after-supporting-beijing/\">declared on Weibo</a> that he was a &ldquo;flag bearer determined to side with China&rdquo;.</p><p>Reactions have been <a href=\"https://supchina.com/2019/08/16/hong-kong-jackson-wang-pulls-out-of-88rising-festival-after-supporting-beijing/\">polarised</a>. Wang was accused of being a traitor by pro-democracy activists, then given a supportive pat on the back by Chinese state media</p><p>In hip-hop parlance, the &ldquo;cipher&rdquo; refers to the circle of participants closing around a group of battling rappers flexing their own skills and challenging each other&rsquo;s ideas to win over an audience. The cipher is about competition, but most crucially, it&rsquo;s about identity, a chance for the rapper to express where they stand and what they believe in.</p><p>At a moment in history when identifying &ldquo;Chinese-ness&rdquo; has never been so vigorously contested &ndash; both on a global scale and in people&rsquo;s personal lives &ndash; it is no surprise that China&rsquo;s rappers are stepping into the cipher. In doing so, they are raising a very basic question about identity: What does it mean to be Chinese?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07t1vy2\"}}</p><p>Once, it felt like there was a cacophony of rap voices cutting across different ideologies, geographies and socio-economic classes &ndash; creatively competing for the hearts and minds of young Chinese. Chengdu rappers, Chongqing rappers and Changsha rappers. Rappers from the coasts of Guangzhou and the highlands of Gansu. Glitzy, cosmopolitan tunes from Shanghai and scrappy, rural tempos of the Northeastern &ldquo;hanmai&rdquo;. Hong Kong rappers, such as Fotan Laiki and Doughboy, spitting rhymes about a hometown in flux. Diaspora rappers like Bohan Phoenix, singing from the cracks of China and the United States.</p><p>Today, the Chinese cipher seems to have ossified into binary themes &ndash; love and hate, anti-China vs pro-China, fervent nationalism vs treason to the nation &ndash; making it a zero-sum game in which conflict can only be resolved by the defeat of one side by the other. Artists like Wang, Melo and Vava, among so many others, seem have forgotten that the cipher is about competition, but also community, creativity and authenticity.</p><p>Instead of creating a unique sense of self and perspective, they have decided to toe the line, parroting the Chinese authorities&rsquo; message.</p><blockquote><p> The Chinese cipher seems to have ossified into binary themes &ndash; love and hate, anti-China vs pro-China, fervent nationalism vs treason to the nation </p></blockquote><p>This is not to say that all Chinese pride is uniformly expressed. Rapper GAI leading chants of Long Live the Motherland at the Spring Festival gala sponsored by state media is a very different brand of patriotism from the Higher Brothers&rsquo; breakout track Made In China. On one hand, the Higher Brothers&rsquo; song &ndash; about how Western products are now made in China &ndash; is indeed a bold assertion of Chinese pride. But the rappers are not boasting about China&rsquo;s national sovereignty, replete with a red and yellow flag, but about the &ldquo;jar of hot sauce so spicy that foreigners start to burn&rdquo;.</p><p>The lyrics aren&rsquo;t Mandarin, the language of national television, but Sichuanese, rich with rising and falling tones, which has great lyrical flow. Unlike the knee-jerk nationalism of Melo&rsquo;s latest Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1INtgtB50z/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=dlfix\">post</a>, this playful, creative, hyperlocal pride is for the spicy food and free-wheeling attitude of its capital, Chengdu.&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07t1vpc\"}}</p><p>Two years ago, I visited Chengdu and sat in the studio of a group of young, aspiring rappers &ndash; TSP, from the outskirts of Sichuan; Rainbow and Skinnyoyo, from the flat, central grasslands of Xi&rsquo;an and Shandong; Kong Kong, from the southern coast of Hong Kong; and Young13DBaby and Fendi Boi, from the northern mountains of Lhasa and Gansu.</p><p>As we sat together, shaking our heads to one of the group&rsquo;s latest collaborations, I was struck by how smoothly they had woven together lyrics in Tibetan, Cantonese, Sichuanese, and Mandarin.</p><p>This scene of six boys, from six different regions of a nation of more than one billion, nodding their heads in unison to the beat of the music they had created together on their own, was the closest I have seen the Chinese cipher in its most platonic form &ndash; playful, inclusive, malleable &ndash; one song yielding the rich plurality of Chinese language and identity.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07t1w7h\"}}</p><p>Hip-hop is a living, breathing culture &ndash; a reflection of the hopes and dreams of two generations of youth.

For the past week, the 24-year-old rapper&rsquo;s home state of Jammu and Kashmir had been under a security clampdown, with the Indian government deploying an additional 35,000 paramilitary troops to what was already one of the most militarised zones in the world.</p><p>Something big was going down. Social media was abuzz with rumours that the Narendra Modi-led BJP government was going to fulfill its poll promise of revoking <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_370_of_the_Constitution_of_India\">Article 370 of the Indian constitution</a>, which guaranteed special status to Jammu and Kashmir. That controversial law was the basis of the state&rsquo;s uneasy accession to India in 1947. Its revocation was likely to lead to a backlash in the state.</p><p>Sitting in Delhi &ndash; where he was working on a music video &ndash; Javed had been stewing in anxiety about his family back home. That evening, he let it all out. In between songs, he opened up to his audience about his fears, urging them to pay attention to what was going on in Kashmir.</p><p>After the set, he stepped off stage and checked his phone, to find a series of missed calls from his brother. &ldquo;I called him back, and my Dad told me that they're going to shut down everything,&rdquo; he remembers, when we talk on the phone a month later. He&rsquo;s been in Kashmir, cut off from the rest of the country for most of the intervening time. &ldquo;The next morning, I woke up to a text from a Kashmiri friend in Delhi, saying, &lsquo;They've done it&rsquo;. I couldn't believe it.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07sj8xc\"}}</p><p>In the early hours of 5 August, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49231619\">the Indian government imposed</a> a total communications blackout on Kashmir &ndash; no phones, no internet, not even regular mail could get through. Curfew was imposed throughout the state. By the time the government announced the abrogation of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49234708\">Article 370</a> &ndash; and the splitting of the state into two federally administered union territories &ndash; the lockdown was complete. In the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49250594\">debate that followed</a>, raging across TV studios, newsprint and social media, there were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49261322\">no voices from Kashmir</a>.</p><p>Feeling unsafe and uncomfortable in his adopted home, where people were celebrating the move on the streets, Javed left for Srinagar two days later. As he made his way home from the airport, negotiating checkpoint after checkpoint, the city reminded him of a ghost town.</p><p>&ldquo;It felt post-apocalyptic,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And it was really scary, because I'd never seen Kashmir under such a big lockdown in all these years. I just had this feeling that this is it, this is the end. It still feels like it's the end of our legacy, our struggle, our identity. The end of Kashmir.&rdquo;</p><p>The son of a local businessman, Javed grew up in Rajbagh, an affluent neighbourhood on the banks of the Jhelum river. The political strife that simmered across the city rarely intruded on his childhood. There would be the occasional curfew, and sometimes his parents would huddle in the corner of the room and whisper about &ldquo;army actions&rdquo;. Other than that, life was &lsquo;normal&rsquo;. The biggest problem he faced was getting into trouble at school for daydreaming. But when he was 13, an incident involving his brother came as a rude awakening.</p><blockquote><p> It still feels like it's the end of our legacy, our struggle, our identity. The end of Kashmir. Ahmer Javed </p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;During curfew, they let you leave the home for one or two hours so you can buy essentials,&rdquo; he remembers. &ldquo;One day my brother had gone out with our driver to get milk, when he was stopped by the security forces. They accused him of being a stone-thrower, and forced him to chant &lsquo;bharat mata ki jai&rsquo; (long live Mother India). He did it, but they started beating him with a stick.&rdquo;</p><p>Javed&rsquo;s brother was beaten for 10 minutes, until his family and neighbours reached the spot and rescued the teenage boy. &ldquo;My mother was crying in the lobby at home, she was worried they&rsquo;d kill him,&rdquo; he remembers, the scene still vivid in his mind. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t understand what was going on, and I was terrified. My knees were shivering.&rdquo;</p><p>It was around the same time that Javed was introduced to rap through 50 Cent&rsquo;s global hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qm8PH4xAss\">In Da Club</a>. Initially drawn in by the macho posturing and flashy music videos of early 2000s gangsta rap, he began to dig deep into the history of the art form. Hip-hop&rsquo;s origins in the disaffected black and Latin communities of 1970s New York resonated with the young Javed, especially their stories about dealing with persistent police brutality. He started penning his own rhymes, recording vocals on his mother&rsquo;s old mobile phone.</p><p>His early tracks were more like gangsta rap than conscious hip-hop, but two people pushed him towards explicitly political songwriting. The first was the emergence of Roushan Illahi, aka MC Kash, a young Kashmiri rapper who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11928968\">rose to prominence</a> during the 2010 Kashmir protests<strong>.</strong> The alleged killing of three civilians by the Indian Army led to months of clashes between protesters and security forces that left over 110 civilians dead. It was at the peak of this uprising that Illahi released <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Protest\">I Protest</a>. Propelled forward by martial rhythms and gunshot samples, the track &ndash; which called out human rights violations by security forces &ndash; became a viral sensation in the state and beyond. Illahi would be a formative influence not only on Javed, but on a whole generation of aspiring Kashmiri musicians.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07sj8l7\"}}</p><p>The other major influence on his music is Ajaz Ahmad Dar. After state elections in 1987 that many believe were rigged in favour of a pro-India Kashmiri leader Farooq Abdullah, many young Kashmiris joined the separatist Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front in its call for armed struggle. Among them was Dar, a college student with a penchant for poetry. He was also Javed&rsquo;s uncle. Dar would be one of the first Kashmiri militants to be killed during the emergency in 1989.</p><p>&ldquo;That vote rigging was the main reason for people picking up arms, because it showed that India didn&rsquo;t care about democracy,&rdquo; says Javed, picking his words carefully. &ldquo;Had my uncle had another medium, he would&rsquo;ve fought <em>uss tareeke se </em>(that way). But there was no other medium, they couldn&rsquo;t understand anything else.&rdquo;</p><p>In response, his family faced consistent police harassment throughout the 1990s &ndash; his grandfather spent four years in jail, another uncle faced torture in an infamous interrogation centre &ndash; locally known as Papa II &ndash; and his father would routinely get picked up by the police for &lsquo;questioning&rsquo;. Though he would never meet his uncle, the family legacy looms large within Javed&rsquo;s music, especially on his debut album <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/azadirecords/sets/little-kid-big-dreams\">Little Kid, Big Dreams</a>.</p><blockquote><p> His early tracks were more like gangsta rap than conscious hip-hop, but two people pushed him towards explicitly political songwriting. </p></blockquote><p>Released in July, Little Kid, Big Dreams is a visceral document of what it&rsquo;s like to grow up in a state grappling with decades of insurgency and counter-insurgency. Javed raps in English, Hindi and Kashmiri, switching effortlessly between the three as he invites the listener into his world, a landscape blighted by decades of curfews, crackdowns and violence.</p><p>Opener Sifar charts his own journey, from a shy introvert with few friends to a confident young rapper spitting bars of defiance. The third track Uncle is a conversation with the uncle he never met, detailing the daily horrors of life in Kashmir. The second half of the track features an older relative narrating the famous &ldquo;Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow&rdquo; monologue from Shakespeare&rsquo;s Macbeth in Kashmiri.</p><p>&ldquo;This is like a message to him, even though he isn&rsquo;t with us,&rdquo; says Javed. &ldquo;But still, I feel that I&rsquo;m somehow in touch with him, in this world, right here, everywhere. You know whenever I&rsquo;m doing something, I feel like he has his hand on me, I sort of get inspired just by hearing his stories because he was really righteous.&rdquo;</p><p>On lead single Elaan, Javed raps about life in a land where &ldquo;insaaf hi mana hai<em>&rdquo;</em> (justice is always denied), with all the swagger and menace of classic 90s gangsta rap, over a beat that shuffles and prowls with unrestrained urgency. Halfway through, he&rsquo;s joined by Azadi Records labelmate Prabh Deep, who comes in like a runaway wrecking ball. Over a breathless two minutes, Prabh Deep calls out everything from the recent war hysteria, to the rising spectre of communal violence, to the apparent spinelessness of Indian media. It&rsquo;s a blistering attack on the state of Indian contemporary politics, delivered with a fervour that surprised even Javed.</p><p>But the heart of the album is Kasheer, a manifesto of resistance delivered entirely in Kashmiri. Javed sets the tone with the opening lines of &ldquo;we&rsquo;re born in curfews/we die in crackdowns&rdquo;, and never lets up from there. The track has become a crowd favourite at shows in Delhi and Mumbai, despite the fact that few understand the lyrics, because Ahmer delivers it with such vehemence and conviction that translation seems almost unnecessary.</p><p>The album ends with the titular track, a rare moment of optimism on a record that is suffused with despair. It reflects Javed&rsquo;s conviction that music can bring about the change in Kashmir that guns or stones could not. It&rsquo;s a conviction that has been sorely tested in recent weeks, as he&rsquo;s shuttled between a home state that has been turned into a prison, and a country that seems indifferent to the trauma that it is inflicting on its own citizens.</p><p>This optimism, it seems, is in short supply. &ldquo;I still believe that picking up the pen is more powerful than picking up something else,&rdquo; says Javed. &ldquo;But I don't know, man. Right now I feel so let down and hopeless that I'm not sure it'll do shit. I'm really in a state where I don't know what to do. I'm very sceptical about music as well. I don't know what to do next.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>BBC Music&rsquo;s greatest hip-hop songs of all time: </strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">The 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time</a> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/slideshow-gallery/20191007-critics-on-the-10-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">What critics had to say about the top 10</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-who-voted\">Full list of critics who participated &ndash; and how they voted</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-why-juicy-is-the-greatest-hip-hop-song-of-all-time\">Why Juicy is number one</a> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-greatest-hip-hop-song-poll-trends-and-surprises\">Trends and surprises in the poll</a> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-why-are-there-so-few-women-in-best-of-hip-hop-polls\">Why are there so few women in hip-hop polls?</a> <br /> <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1eGrbfxp7ASnjPgAvO5TXU\">Playlist of the top 25 songs</a></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":null,"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2019-10-30T19:27:19.635Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Ahmer Javed: Rapper shining a spotlight on divided Kashmir","HeadlineShort":"The Kashmir rapper breaking the silence","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"How 50 Cent and police brutality helped form the rapper’s songs about living in a state under decades of revolt.","IsSyndicated":false,"Latitude":"","Location":null,"Longitude":"","Option":[{"Content":{"Description":"Apple News Publish: Select to publish, remove to unpublish.

The Atlanta rapper, born Jeffery Lamar Williams, has been a growing force in hip-hop for the better part of a decade. His instantly recognisable alto has been slithering and crawling its way up the charts for almost a decade, but the last 24 months have seen Thug rise to become the sun king at the centre of rap&rsquo;s solar system.</p><p>In 2019, Young Thug became his own genre. He won his first Grammy for backing vocals and ad-libs on Childish Gambino&rsquo;s This is America. Thug's last album So Much Fun debuted at number one in the United States, a commercial culmination that displayed the artist&rsquo;s musical contrasts in all their glory. It&rsquo;s his answer to Lil Wayne&rsquo;s career-defining Tha Carter III, a smartly-constructed distillation of his appeal &ndash; more coronation than a classic &ndash; diluting his berserk experimentation in favour of a restrained fluorescent joy that could appeal to suburban teens discovering vape pens and rap for the first time.</p><p>As well as topping the album chart, he briefly occupied 11 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, including his Post Malone collaboration, Goodbyes, which still receives over a million streams daily. And yet, Thugga's most impressive legacy is his army of imitators; young artists who discovered that there's money and fame to be made from idiosyncratic rhymes and unconventional sounds.</p><p>In the early 2010s Thug emerged from Atlanta, the city that has largely set the tone for hip-hop across this decade. The conventional narrative around Thug&rsquo;s convention-melting screeches and warbles always considered him far too extraterrestrial, idiosyncratic, and hostile to the promotional demands required to become the chart-topping festival-headlining star that his talent warranted.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rmfkh\"}}</p><p>Yet, the 10th of 11 children from the Jonesboro South projects in Atlanta has become ubiquitous on the Spotify US Top 50, even when he&rsquo;s not in plain sight. Consider Camilla Cabello, the ex-Fifth Harmony singer &ndash; her biggest solo record is Havana, her 2017 collaboration with Young Thug. Or Drake, the most commercially impactful rapper of the decade, who has repeatedly cribbed Thug&rsquo;s slippery electric-eel cadences, most notably on last year&rsquo;s track Mob Ties.</p><p>In rap, influence usually begins regionally and expands outward. So, it&rsquo;s unsurprising that practically every recent Atlanta artist owes paternity to the rapper briefly known as SEX. Take February&rsquo;s Three Headed Snake from Gunna, a rapper signed to Young Thug&rsquo;s label YSL. Last year, Gunna and another Thug prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Lil Baby, broke beyond the Rolling Loud discourse with Drip Too Hard, an unofficial spinoff of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3BizlMDH0\">Future and Thug&rsquo;s Drippin on Me</a>.</p><blockquote><p> Even someone as revolutionary as Thugger couldn&rsquo;t have existed without his acknowledged idol, Lil' Wayne </p></blockquote><p>The difference between homage, imitation, and apprenticeship may remain forever murky. The old rap line held that no <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=biting\">biting</a> was allowed was summed up by Wu Tang Clan&rsquo;s Raekwon: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want no one sounding like me on no album.&rdquo; A more equanimous view came from TS Eliot: &ldquo;Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different.&rdquo; Even someone as revolutionary as Thugger couldn&rsquo;t have existed without his acknowledged idol, Lil Wayne, whose slurred codeine hexes splintered rap&rsquo;s possibilities in a thousand directions.</p><p>Listening to Thug&rsquo;s first mixtapes from the beginning of the decade, the dragon-in-couture croak and Jabberwocky rhyme schemes that followed are absent. It&rsquo;s all muted riffs on Wayne. Even on his first notable project, 2011&rsquo;s I Came From Nothing 2, he remains in thrall to his hero, though songs like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6iQAEL7fHA\">Keep In Touch</a> revealed his limitless potential. Like all of Thug&rsquo;s best work, the track is resistant to critical rambling. It&rsquo;s built on puppy-dog romanticism that could have come from Motown&hellip; if it were hijacked by a 6-foot-4-inch nose-ringed, gambling-obsessed, ex-high school quarterback from the slums.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rmd5h\"}}</p><p>Young Thug&rsquo;s breakthrough came with 2013&rsquo;s Stoner. It was an entirely different species from what had come before, forged from a DNA mutation whose bloodstream was equal parts strawberry jolly rancher, promethazine, weed, molly, and esoteric powders beamed in from the plug on Betelgeuse.</p><p>On Stoner, he shrieks and moans, vomiting nightmare cantillations and euphoric wails, stretching syllables until they collapse under the stress, disappearing into the vanishing point. He spell-screams &ldquo;L-E-A-N-I-N-G&rdquo; like a spoiled child begging to open his Christmas presents early, but discovering that the only things under the tree are Styrofoam and codeine. Thug&rsquo;s voice contorts into neon lava; he uses it like Jimi Hendrix using a wah-wah-pedal. It&rsquo;s a live power cord writhing in the street during a lightning storm.</p><blockquote><p> It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to guess who will end up surpassing him, or at least annexing new territory </p></blockquote><p>The next three years marked a run that can match nearly any creative streak in history. There was the Rich Gang project with fellow Atlanta MC Rich Homie Quan (whose own stylistic influence is often overlooked), which somehow fulfilled Quan&rsquo;s boast that they were the &ldquo;hardest duo since OutKast&rdquo;. As for Thug&rsquo;s solo work, the first two volumes of the Slime Season series are deliriously improvised masterpieces, often overlooked because like Rich Gang, they never made it onto streaming services. The zenith may have been 2015&rsquo;s Barter 6, his first project made available for commercial release. There&rsquo;s arguably his most innovative song, Halftime, where he introduces half-a-dozen different flows, switching direction with the startling agility and blinding speed of a Simone Biles floor routine.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rmcnr\"}}</p><p>To date, his rap family hasn&rsquo;t captured the full summation of what has made Thug immortal. Each of his proteges seem to work within a small parcel of his flows, melodies and vocal textures. It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to guess who will end up surpassing him, or at least annexing new territory. It could be his &ldquo;little brothers&rdquo; Gunna and Lil Baby, whose collaboration Drip or Drown 2 reached number three on the Billboard album charts earlier this year. This summer, Thug and Future announced that the little brothers would join their elders for a Super Slimey sequel, forming an Atlanta rap Avengers.</p><blockquote><p> Weighing art is more complex and inscrutable than merely playing a game of spot the influence </p></blockquote><p>That said, there is an argument that the first half-generation of Thug-influenced rappers have already transformed his innovations into something singular. Travis Scott famously cribbed Thug&rsquo;s Pick Up the Phone for one of his first huge solo hits, and it&rsquo;s obvious that the Houston rapper&rsquo;s ad-libs, vocal pitch and melodies are derived from Thug, albeit blended with 808s and Yeezus-era Kanye).</p><p>Playboi Carti has become one of the biggest artists of the moment by triangulating Chicago artist Chief Keef with Thug. Philadelphia-born Lil Uzi Vert rapped like Meek Mill until he moved to Atlanta, signed to DJ Drama&rsquo;s label, and popped up on Slime Season 2.</p><p>Of course, weighing art is more complex and inscrutable than merely playing a game of spot the influence. A hit song like Lil Uzi Vert&rsquo;s XO Tour Llif3 was clearly informed by Uzi&rsquo;s own life and emotions, not to mention the mall punk of the last decade. But it&rsquo;s hard to imagine it existing or having the impact it did without Young Thug laying the foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rmgp2\"}}</p><p>It&rsquo;s been 20 years since that MTV Music Awards where Eminem famously stormed the stage with a hundred lookalikes with bleached hair, white tees, and blue jeans. The idea was that he embodied the millions of aggrieved middle-American white boys obsessed with rap, who up until that point hadn&rsquo;t seen themselves credibly represented within the genre. For a year or two after Eminem blew up, every major label attempted to trot out their own Eminem replicant, but none survived (save for a few classic Bubba Sparxx singles).</p><p>But now tastes and music distribution models have changed, and with it, the desire to hear artists that are better or at least different. If you were going to redo that same awards show today, you might do it with 100 Young Thugs standing in a straight line onstage, the alien visionary at the forefront, his descendants in designer clothes and dyed hair, taking his cue and rapping along simultaneously. It would be hard to hear the difference over the sound of the applause.</p><p><strong>More on BBC Music&rsquo;s greatest hip-hop songs of all time: </strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">The 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time</a> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/slideshow-gallery/20191007-critics-on-the-10-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">What critics had to say about the top 10</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-who-voted\">Full list of critics who participated &ndash; and how they voted</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-greatest-hip-hop-song-poll-trends-and-surprises\">Trends and surprises in the poll</a> (<em>not available in UK</em>)<br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-why-are-there-so-few-women-in-best-of-hip-hop-polls\">Why are there so few women in hip-hop polls?</a> <br /> <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1eGrbfxp7ASnjPgAvO5TXU\">Playlist of the top 25 songs</a> (<em>Spotify</em>)</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2019-10-21T14:34:07.861Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Why Young Thug is the 21st Century’s most influential rapper","HeadlineShort":"Is this the century's biggest rapper?","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"The Atlanta star has become his own genre; he is the sun king at the centre of rap’s solar system","IsSyndicated":false,"Latitude":"","Location":null,"Longitude":"","Option":[],"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":null,"RelatedTag":[],"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"The Atlanta star has become his own genre; he is the sun king at the centre of rap’s solar system","SummaryShort":"Why Young Thug has completely changed the game for hip-hop","SuperSection":[],"Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2019-10-22T10:46:25.219166Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"53c60471-50b9-49fa-a29a-8e5845cf93d0","Id":"wwculture/story/20191021-why-young-thug-is-the-21st-centurys-most-influential-rapper","ModifiedDateTime":"2019-10-22T10:46:25.219166Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"20191021-why-young-thug-is-the-21st-centurys-most-influential-rapper"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwculture/story/20191021-why-young-thug-is-the-21st-centurys-most-influential-rapper","_id":"5e9b8c8d59dee61835801af4"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>On 5 September, the day that German rapper OG Keemo released his new single 216, his Twitter timeline was headed by a retweet of one of his idols, American MC Earl Sweatshirt: &ldquo;I guess this the part where white people call me racist for being pro black,&rdquo; followed by the shrug emoji. A self-fulfilling prophecy, as it turned out.</p><p>For the next five days, in which Keemo&rsquo;s song and its accompanying, brutal visuals sent ripples through the German rap scene, his notoriously funny Twitter feed kept quiet. Apparently, the track&rsquo;s explicit imagery of everyday racism, black pride, self-hatred, and racial profiling left some feeling personally attacked.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish I wasn't the type of guy to read YouTube comments,&rdquo; OG Keemo says, laughing. &ldquo;People think because those themes don't directly affect them, they simply don't exist. I knew some people would get upset. But I never thought I would get called a full-blown racist for addressing their inherent racism.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since appearing on the scene in 2017, OG Keemo has been somewhat of an outlier in the current German rap landscape. The son of a Sudanese man who came to Germany in 1990, the 26-year-old is heralded as the future, mixing his thoughtful lyrics with street sensibilities. Growing up in the mid-90s between the southwestern cities of Mainz, Heidelberg and Mannheim (where he still resides today), Keemo was raised on a diet of Sade, Nelly, Coltrane and 50 Cent&rsquo;s Get Rich or Die Tryin&rsquo;.</p><p><strong>Stoic cool</strong></p><p>Stylistically, he is an MC of the post-everything ilk who has mastered rap as a native language in itself; the kind that makes you wonder how people could have ever struggled to hold a beat or find clean, multi-syllabic rhymes for every curse word in the dictionary. His musical tastes and his rapping abilities are truly advanced.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07s22nl\"}}</p><p>On his three latest releases Neptun, Skalp, and Otello, Keemo&rsquo;s biggest trick has been to perform his raps with the stoic cool of an unfazed, post-game NFL player.</p><p>This knack for code-switching became most apparent in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fz_UvJVEvg\">Vorwort</a>, his breakout song that defined the early stages of his career. In it, he moved effortlessly from punchlines about &ldquo;gliding through the streets like a manta ray&rdquo; to discussing his mother&rsquo;s passing mere days before signing his record deal; all wrapped up in one, hook-free stream of thought. In interviews and on his tracks, he&rsquo;s outspoken about his first and second passions in life being visual art and stealing stuff (he still engages in the former via his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv2PFJiFZnW/\">Joel Novelle Instagram</a> account).</p><blockquote><p> The 26-year-old is heralded as the future, mixing his thoughtful lyrics with street sensibilities </p></blockquote><p>Mix that with an infectious sense of humour, and you have an MC persona as complex as the times he tries to make sense of in the track 216.&nbsp;</p><p>For 216, OG Keemo tried a different writing approach. Instead of jotting down the lyrics in one go, the song consists of various lines he&rsquo;s written about different experiences of daily racism throughout his life. It&rsquo;s all held together by a recurring reference to his father who raised him on a &lsquo;by any means&rsquo; ideology, urging him to &ldquo;never turn the other cheek&rdquo;. The song culminates in the gripping depiction of an encounter with a racist policeman struggling to accept that his grandchildren are, in fact, mixed race.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ghost notes</strong></p><p>Sonically, 216 is as radio- and club-unfriendly as its lyrical content. The beat, as always provided by Keemo&rsquo;s producer and childhood friend Funkvater Frank, consists of little more than a few piano notes, rattling chains, scattered bits of sound design and some ghoulish screams at the song&rsquo;s peak. It&rsquo;s a fittingly odd choice for the lead-single of their upcoming debut album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zTfAD8KYhE\">Geist (Ghost)</a>. This is particularly noteworthy since Geist will be released on Chimperator, a Stuttgart-based label still best known for initiating the rise of masked pop-rap star Cro.&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07s22hp\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;I guess people wouldn't have expected such a track from me, simply because I wasn't very political in my songs so far. To be perfectly honest, I was against dropping this first. I thought we should come out with a banger. But Frankie suggested that it would be a good idea to put this out as a first statement. Of course, 216 is one of the most poignant songs on the album, so he was completely right,&rdquo; says OG Keemo.</p><blockquote><p> &ldquo;I guess people wouldn't have expected such a track from me, simply because I wasn't very political in my songs so far&rdquo; &ndash; OG Keemo </p></blockquote><p>Presented without any further explanation, the title 216 had fans and critics wondering about its meaning. Most listeners speculated that the number in the title referred to a paragraph in the German Criminal Code concerned with &ldquo;killing on request&rdquo;. Keemo is quick to debunk that theory &ndash; he&rsquo;d rather leave it at that. However, one could see where this theory stems from; after all, it is Keemo, dressed up in the same white military uniform that he&rsquo;s wearing at the beginning of the clip, who kicks away the chair at his own hanging.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s this circular structure of every-day racism and self-destructive behaviour that Keemo finds most frustrating.</p><p>&ldquo;I don't say we're to be blamed for what's happening. On the other hand, I also don&rsquo;t feel &lsquo;It's an us-against-them scenario&rsquo;. The last thing I wanted to achieve with this song is create more division. But, my father came here around 1990 and I&rsquo;m shocked when he tells me that nothing ever changed,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;One of the comments I saw most frequently was &ldquo;this only applies to America, never to Germany&rdquo;. To me, this is evidence that people have no clue what is really going on here. Because we never address it.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07s226d\"}}</p><p>This unapologetic anger expressed in 216 couldn&rsquo;t be more timely. The single was released against the backdrop of the elections in Saxony and Brandenburg, in which the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49544781\">far-right AFD party surged in elections</a>, and the results were mostly met with a collective <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49549670\">sigh of relief</a> about how it could it have been even worse. It&rsquo;s this form of apathy and ignorance towards the struggle of others that 216 counters with anger directed at everyone who still chooses to not listen, even when they&rsquo;re told loud and clear by those affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That is exactly what I don't understand&rdquo;, says Keemo. &ldquo;For example, it would never occur to me say &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t get it, why are these women complaining all of a sudden?

One of his songs is called I Might Vote 4 Trump, while on his typically experimental new album,&nbsp;All My Heroes Are Cornballs, he raps, as a black man, about wanting to be adopted by Madonna and merrily drinking the tears of &ldquo;rednecks&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07r3k5k\"}}</p><p>But the fact he does all this over ugly, uneven beats, built around thick waves of distortion and screaming synths, means Hendricks could just as easily be categorised as punk rock as hip-hop.&nbsp;Free the Frail, one of his new LP&rsquo;s standout tracks, speaks directly to punk&rsquo;s anti-capitalist values, as Hendricks claims: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rely on the strength of my image&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> Back in the 1980s, rap and punk were both genres that got frowned upon by the elite just for being what they were &ndash; JPEGMAFIA, aka Barrington Hendricks </p></blockquote><p>In Barcelona, as dozens of teenagers enthusiastically bang heads to songs with subversive titles such as I Cannot Wait Until Morrissey Dies and Digital Blackface, it&rsquo;s easy to draw a parallel between Hendricks and the bold onstage personas of legendary anti-establishment acts like The Sex Pistols or The Clash, artists who also knew how to channel youthful angst into something euphoric and liberating.</p><p>Hendricks is happy to indulge in the comparison. &ldquo;Back in the early 1980s when rappers couldn&rsquo;t perform in the fancy venues because the police were too racist and scared, it was the punk venues letting them in to perform,&rdquo; he tells BBC Culture. &ldquo;I guess race was the big thing separating [rap and punk] in the general public eye, but they were both resilient genres that got [frowned upon] by the elite just for being what they were. They gave a home to outsiders. I [have] always felt like they were just the same thing, but both wrapped up in a different way.&rdquo;</p><p>Growing up, he explains, he was equally enthusiastic about political rappers like Ice Cube and Chuck D as hardcore punk bands like Bad Brains and Fear. &ldquo;I saw Fear perform live at a young age, so I guess you could say I draw from that same energy.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Modern punk heroes</strong></p><p>Today, JPEGMAFIA is one of dozens of young rappers and rap acts drawing heavily from the DIY ethos of punk rock to create music to be moshed to. The likes of Death Grips, Run The Jewels, Denzel Curry, Danny Brown, Sheck Wes, Rico Nasty, Ski Mask The Slump God, and Travis Scott (who was arrested&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/05/travis-scott-pleads-not-guilty-inciting-riot-arkansas-show/\">back in 2017</a>&nbsp;after the police accused him of inciting a riot at one of his shows) perform with the same transgressive vigour of 1970s punk icons. When Sheck Wes plays the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3ybOVJJEQs\">stirring Mo Bamba live</a>, it recalls the renegade firecracker spirit of Nirvana&rsquo;s iconic Smells Like Teen Spirit video.</p><p>In the UK, snarling Northampton rapper Slowthai thrillingly struts around the stage like a modern-day Sid Vicious. He blasts what he sees as the toxicity of Brexit Britain in a way that&rsquo;s pure punk provocation. It&rsquo;s no surprise, for example, that he carried around a fake severed head of Prime Minister Boris Johnson during his performance at last month&rsquo;s Mercury Prize amid ugly beats inspired just as much by Gang of Four as Dizzee Rascal. His punk-ish rap peers include Scarlxrd and Master Peace. On the other hand, you could also point to the hip-hop influence of lo-fi British punk bands like Idles and Sleaford Mods as a sign of the convergence between the two genres.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07r3jx2\"}}</p><p>Prolific Long Island producer Kenny Beats, real name Kenneth Blume III, has worked with many of the aforementioned artists, helping shape the punk-rap sound that&rsquo;s currently ruling the underground.&nbsp;He believes the fact more and more rap artists are gaining a penchant for primal screaming and ugly production is simply a reflection of our times. &ldquo;The other month I played a show just 24 hours after there were two mass shootings here in America,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The planet is literally on fire, so what more can an artist like Rico Nasty do but scream? It&rsquo;s instinctual to rappers at this particular moment. It&rsquo;s how they process the world.&rdquo; He says he&rsquo;s currently producing a record for hardcore punk band Trash Talk &ldquo;that's pure thrash with no electronic drums, but that way of working isn&rsquo;t too dissimilar from when I work with JPEGMAFIA or Slowthai.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>A 21st-Century protest</strong></p><p>In this age of social media, where people fire off snarky political opinions every couple of seconds, Kenny believes that anti-establishment protest music can have trouble cutting through. To have a real impact, it&rsquo;s less about what you say than how you say it. &ldquo;You need to make people think about society in a less literal and more primal way,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about using the least amount of sounds to make the most amount of noise and energy, and making a bass stab really feel like you&rsquo;ve been punched in the face. A lot of the rap I produce really has that kind of punk essence. When I work with JPEGMAFIA he asks me for the worst beat possible as I guess a rapper that makes something that&rsquo;s raw and ugly and chaotic is definitely going to stand out and feel more human right now, because things aren&rsquo;t pretty out there.&rdquo;</p><p>Rico Nasty, real name Maria Kelly,&nbsp;is a 22-year-old Maryland rapper every bit as enigmatic and hell-raising live as JPEGMAFIA &ndash; the fact she&rsquo;s pushing similar buttons as a woman makes her, arguably, even more important. On songs like Bitch I&rsquo;m Nasty and Rage, which are both produced by Kenny Beats, who also guided the music on her most recent album&nbsp;Anger Management<em>,</em>&nbsp;Kelly attacks the gnarly guitars and cutting drums with real venom, every word delivered like she&rsquo;s face-to-face with her worst enemy. Sometimes she just starts screaming in between bars.</p><blockquote><p> I&rsquo;ll see straight guys moshing with the gay guys and I love that &ndash; Rico Nasty, aka Maria Kelly </p></blockquote><p>Evoking the DC comic book character Harley Quinn, her bold onstage look is about reclaiming the colours white female punk artists wore before her and showing her fans, many of whom feel like outsiders, that they can be anything they want to be. It&rsquo;s quietly revolutionary.</p><p>&ldquo;If you come to a Rico Nasty show you&rsquo;ll see all kinds of people, dancing together as one in the mosh pit,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see straight guys moshing with the gay guys and I love that. A lot of these people aren&rsquo;t able to let out their anger in the real world without being demonised, particularly black women, but they can at my show and to my songs. It&rsquo;s a safe space to let out all the rage, and that&rsquo;s healthy. It&rsquo;s like group therapy.&rdquo;</p><p>In a world with infinite choice, thanks to streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music, Kelly believes fans expect more from their favourite artists &ndash; because, if their interest palls, they can quickly move on to something else. By embodying the fearless punk values of her hero Joan Jett, she can ensure she lives up to their estimations, she says. &ldquo;They gotta see me go crazy on stage or I&rsquo;m not doing my job! it's all about showing emotions because they paid good money to see you and they don&rsquo;t want to just see me stand still. You&rsquo;re the person who made their favourite song so you should be performing until your voice cracks [like the punk artists voices&rsquo; used to do].&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07r3jy3\"}}</p><p>It&rsquo;s something Hendricks very much agrees with. Punk in the 1970s was a reaction to the overly conceptual progressive rock that bands like Pink Floyd and Genesis were releasing. The Sex Pistols&rsquo; two-minute songs, which used a minimal amount of chords played as shoddily as possible, were in stark contrast to the stadium rock that some young people found pretentious.</p><p>Similarly, Hendricks believes the reason rap with punk sensibilities resonates right now is because the melodic &lsquo;trap&rsquo; sound that has dominated the radio for so long is also starting to become stale. Hip-hop fans could be looking for something to counter the neatly produced club trap anthems by stars like Drake and Migos, which means music that&rsquo;s more unhinged and doesn&rsquo;t read from a script, and artists who enjoy giving their all on stage and are comfortable making people feel, well, uncomfortable.</p><p>&ldquo;So much of rap sounds the same, and that&rsquo;s okay, but that means some people want something that can be the complete opposite too. We&rsquo;re entering an era where you have to leave a part of yourself on the stage and really make the crowd move. People aren&rsquo;t going to just accept your presence or you miming to a song; you have to really do your job, you know? Maybe that&rsquo;s where [punk-rap] comes in. I feel like this is the only time this sound really has a chance to break through into the mainstream.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Two genres united</strong></p><p>But if punk-rap makes sense for this particular cultural moment, it&rsquo;s hardly a new phenomenon. As John Robb, the author of Punk Rock: An Oral History &ndash; and a rock legend in his own right as lead vocalist in post-punk band The Membranes &ndash; points out, rap and punk first became intertwined in the 1980s, a time when The Clash experimented with a rap edge on The Magnificent Seven.</p><p>He believes Public Enemy were the first band to really bring the two different audiences together, with their rough, hard-hitting boom-bap sound resonating with both black kids in the inner cities and white kids in the suburbs. The fact that, in the 1980s, iconic producer Rick Rubin would split his time between producing new albums for hip-hop acts like Run DMC and The Beastie Boys and hardcore bands like Slayer and The Cult, also helped to create links between the two cultures. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Public Enemy were really the first band to resonate with both camps,&rdquo; says Robb. &ldquo;Chuck D was a huge fan of The Clash and I know from speaking with him, he studied all of the punk bands. I saw them on the Anthrax tour and Public Enemy blew this hardcore band right off the stage. I&rsquo;m sure every white punk fan in the audience became a rap fan after that.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> These kids live in such a distorted world that the music is lying if it isn&rsquo;t distorted as well &ndash; John Robb </p></blockquote><p>As the 1990s arrived, hip-hop&rsquo;s punk sensibility was further enforced by in-your-face acts like Ice Cube, DMX, Onyx, and Rage Against the Machine. Then, although he&rsquo;s easy to mock now, Atlanta rapper Lil Jon also spliced genres to innovative effect with &lsquo;crunk&rsquo;, his southern rap take on punk, which prioritised uncomfortably loud horns and repetitive screams. It&rsquo;s no surprise that Denzel Curry, one of punk-rap&rsquo;s most prominent artists, channelled Lil Jon&rsquo;s trademark &ldquo;what&rdquo; screams on his 2018 song SUMO | ZUMO. &ldquo;Lil Jon was definitely a pioneer for some of the punk-rap acts we see now,&rdquo; agrees Kenny Beats. &ldquo;He showed you could scream on a song and still have a hit on the radio. He even sampled [US heavy metal guitarist] Randy Rhoads, so it was obvious he knew what he was doing.&rdquo;</p><p>But Lil Jon was hardly an anti-establishment renegade, more just someone who found a sound that stood out from the norm. It was around a decade ago that punk-rap really returned with a vengeance, via authentic anarchist acts like Tyler the Creator&rsquo;s Odd Future collective.&nbsp;The Los Angeles group weren&rsquo;t afraid to release incendiary singles where hooks were built around calls to burn schools, among other things, while beats were both manic and minimalist. They lived the punk life they rapped about, hanging out at skate parks and dingy clubs in three-day-old clothes. This DIY spirit made them feel like the black Sex Pistols. And Kanye West borrowed punk elements for his brilliantly bleak 2013 album Yeezus. On it, he took Odd Future-style industrial sonics and made them more palatable for the mainstream, sampling post-punk bands such as Section 25 and offering up riotous tirades like Black Skinhead.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07r3k3v\"}}</p><p>But Kenny Beats believes one of the most important songs in this new age of punk could be Look At Me by XXXTentacion &ndash; the controversial Florida rapper, real name Jahseh&nbsp;Onfroy, who was shot dead last year at the age of 20, while facing multiple criminal charges. The 2017 song features uncomfortable levels of distortion and unhinged vocals as Onfroy, then just a teenager recording in his bedroom with a cheap microphone bought on eBay, refers to himself as the new Kurt Cobain. Peaking at 34 on the Billboard 100, it was the moment punk-rap showed it could really be a force on the pop charts.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you think [about the person and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45971796\">the allegations</a>], there&rsquo;s no denying Look at Me was one of the most punk-rock moments in a long, long time,&rdquo; says Kenny Beats, when asked why the song resonates so much with the current generation of rap fans. &ldquo;You play it in a room and people are ready to riot. XXX sounds like a scary cult leader rapping over the worst sounding MP3 I&rsquo;ve ever heard, but everything about that song bottles this idea of being young and not giving a damn. It&rsquo;s the reason why you hear distorted drums on an Ariana Grande song or people putting out two minute singles. Its influence is everywhere. It doesn&rsquo;t have a message, but that&rsquo;s what makes it have one somehow.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> People get upset that the old rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll attitude doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore, but it&rsquo;s right there in front of them &ndash; JPEGMAFIA, aka Barrington Hendricks </p></blockquote><p>As conversation rages around Brexit, Trump and global warming, there is a feeling among some young people that they are paying for the sins of their parents and have inherited a world that is teetering on the edge. It&rsquo;s in this context that the darker punk-rap sound has resonated deeply, says Robb. &ldquo;These kids live in such a distorted world that the music is lying if it isn&rsquo;t distorted as well.&rdquo;</p><p>However, he&rsquo;s keen to point out the impact of the internet in making this style of music popular too: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to remember that genre boundaries don&rsquo;t really exist like they did before. With streaming, every genre cross-pollinates into the next and you just hop from one thing to another. That makes it easier for punk-rap to thrive than it could in the 1980s or 1990s, as back then, everything had to be a hit on a radio. Now, you just put it on Soundcloud and it gets a million views and kids will treat like you like a rock star.&rdquo;</p><p>So often, Hendricks says, he reads &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; articles from white music journalists speculating when guitar-driven punk is going to make a comeback and &ldquo;save music&rdquo;. Yet he believes this is a blinkered question founded in racism &ndash; critics are unwilling to acknowledge that punk never went anywhere, but its spirit is now embodied by hip-hop, and phallic guitars have been replaced by dusty 808 drums.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;[Rock music] is stagnant, yet here we are in 2019 still clinging on to this old idea of what rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll is. People get upset that the old attitude doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore, but it&rsquo;s right there in front of them: we&rsquo;re the new rock stars&rdquo;.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><em>&nbsp;page or message us on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><strong>The Essential List</strong></a>.

width=\"100%\" /></a></p><p>Rap folkl&oacute;rico palenquero represents the voice of the people, says Andris Padilla Julio, leader of the Afro-Colombian hip-hop group Kombilesa Mi. The crew rapidly switches between Spanish and another language &ndash; but it is not English, the international language of hip-hop.</p><p>The other language is Palenquero, one of the two creole languages native to Colombia. There are 68 indigenous languages in the country, and many of them are under threat of going extinct from &ldquo;pressure to assimilate&rdquo; or Colombia&rsquo;s long-running internal conflict with drug cartels and paramilitary forces.</p><p>Palenquero traces its linguistic roots to the Bantu language family native to sub-Saharan Africa, and includes influence from several romance languages as well. It is centuries old, and hip-hop might help it survive further into the 21st Century.</p><p>&ldquo;At one point, Palenquero was considered poorly spoken Spanish, and because of that, people felt bad and decided not to speak it,&rdquo; says Padilla Julio, who goes by the name Afro Netto. <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/world/2016/03/24/palenque-colombia-dying-language-palenquero-became-living-treasure/82098228/\">A grassroots revival</a> in the latter half of the 20th Century sought to fight these negative stereotypes while at the same time re-establishing the language among the town&rsquo;s roughly 3,500 inhabitants.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rq7r6\"}}</p><p>Similarly, Kombilesa Mi places an emphasis on language and identity through its music, partly making Palenquero words and phrases accessible to audiences. &ldquo;If we want people to learn how to say goodbye, we do it by singing, adding some rhythm, and people enjoy that,&rdquo; says Padilla Julia. This common didactic approach also explains why, for Padilla Julio, hip-hop is such a natural foundation for a rap version of&nbsp; folkl&oacute;rico palenquero: &ldquo;With hip-hop, people can dance but they also listen, and since I&rsquo;m interested in delivering a message... hip-hop allows me to do that and that&rsquo;s why I love it.&rdquo;</p><p>Adapting the rhythmic elements of hip-hop to traditional Palenque music and instruments cements it into the community. Though ultimately, it is hip-hop&rsquo;s legacy as a form of social protest that gives rap folkl&oacute;rico palenquero its sense of immediacy. &ldquo;People see in us [Kombilesa Mi] that courage, that voice of support, that voice of protest, struggle,&rdquo; adds Padilla Julio. &ldquo;And the way that we&rsquo;re using hip-hop, we&rsquo;re not just protesting, but making ourselves stronger, too.&rdquo; This is important given both the social context and history of San Basilio de Palenque, a town of 3500 people at the base of the Montes de Mar&iacute;a and the home of Kombilesa Mi.</p><blockquote><p> For centuries, San Basilio de Palenque has been a symbol of resistance, one that manifests in its language, culture, and identity </p></blockquote><p>Kombilesa Mi (&ldquo;my friends&rdquo; in Palenquero) was formed in 2011 and boasts nine members. The group released their debut album As&iacute; es Palenque in 2016, recording in San Basilio de Palenque&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.okayafrica.com/afro-colombia-studio-palenque/\">first and only music studio</a>. Along the way, they&rsquo;ve forged relationships with Afro-Colombian groups doing similar work in other cities across Colombia, such as <a href=\"https://rostrosurbanos.org/\">Rostros Urbanos in Buenaventura</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Nonprofit-Organization/Corporaci%C3%B3n-Afrolombiana-Son-Bat%C3%A1-213460988671551/\">Son Bat&aacute; in Medell&iacute;n</a>. Kombilesa Mi also has a strong presence, says Padilla Julio, among the Palenque diaspora in the capital Bogot&aacute;. In addition, the group has toured abroad, establishing rap folkl&oacute;rico palenquero not just as a musical genre, but a broader social movement connecting past to present for audiences both inside and outside Palenque.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rv31r\"}}</p><p>For centuries, San Basilio de Palenque has been a symbol of resistance, one that shines through in its language, culture, and identity. The small town is known historically as the first free settlement in the Americas; escaped African slaves bound for Colombian plantations settled the town in the 17th Century and were granted their freedom in perpetuity in the 18th Century after nearly a century of fighting Spanish colonialists. It's the only settlement of its kind that survives into the present.</p><p>As a result, In 2005, Unesco recognised San Basilio de Palenque by adding it to the List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Kombilesa Mi have dedicated themselves to preserving this legacy, in the same way it was passed on to the group&rsquo;s members. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what our teachers used to tell us, that Palenque culture goes from generation to generation,&rdquo; says Padilla Julio.</p><p>On Tuesdays and Thursdays, for example, workshops on language, hairstyling, and community identity are held. On the remaining weekdays, the groups offers music and dance classes. &ldquo;We do this so that the kids can grow up with a solid identity,&rdquo; says Guillermo Camacho, manager of Kombilesa Mi. &ldquo;Our work is to strengthen Palenquero identity through music and language has always been an element that&rsquo;s allowed us to strengthen our community.&rdquo; The group also works on community murals, which often feature phrases in Palenquero.</p><blockquote><p> This is what the town&rsquo;s residents have been looking for a long time &ndash; Padilla Julio </p></blockquote><p>Rap folkl&oacute;rico palenquero is at the heart of these initiatives. As such, hip-hop has been embraced into the community in a big way, especially among the youth, says Padilla Julio. This, he explains, is a byproduct of its fusion with Palenque culture and tradition rather than prior attempts to imitate hip-hop from other countries, such as Venezuela, Cuba, or the United States. Above all, rap folkl&oacute;rico palenquero has helped the community learn that hip-hop is a genre that encourages its listeners to &ldquo;raise your voice and protest&rdquo;.</p><p>For Camacho, this ability to question the status quo resonates with the lives of Palenque speakers, from poor water and electric systems to cultural appropriation. &ldquo;What does it mean to be free when you don&rsquo;t have access to education, to healthcare, to good jobs?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;What does freedom mean when they discriminate against you because of the colour of your skin?&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rq89f\"}}</p><p>Though longstanding, these systemic issues &ndash; to an extent &ndash; are magnified following the 2016 peace accords, which ended a 52-year insurgency by guerrilla rebels from the left-wing Farc. &ldquo;The problem isn&rsquo;t just the guerrilla,&rdquo; says Camacho. There are other forms of violence wrought against the community, racism and discrimination notwithstanding. Camacho adds that the ongoing murder of social activists and leaders in Afro and Indigenous communities &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colombia-peace-feature/murder-of-hundreds-of-colombian-activists-casts-shadow-over-peace-process-idUSKCN1VF0IK\">hundreds since the 2016 deal</a> &ndash; is nothing new. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to take away our path, because we are awakening other communities, other leaders,&rdquo; says Padilla Julio. That is why music has become such a powerful tool.</p><p>Kombilesa Mi are currently preparing for the release of their second album, entitled Esa Palenquera. A celebration of women and their contributions to Palenque, the album was recorded in the mountains of Minca, at the studio of producer Cristi&aacute;n Casta&ntilde;o.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rq7z9\"}}</p><p>The change of scenery coincided with an overall shift to a more organic sound. There are no guitars, nor digital instruments, just rap folkl&oacute;rico palenquero in its purest form, with tracks named for traditional dances such as Mapal&eacute; and Pica Pica, or a popular traditional beverage in the case of &Ntilde;eque. Others, such as No M&aacute;s Siscriminaci&oacute;n, carry an explicit social message. Los Peinados, in turn, takes a didactic approach, instructing the listener on the history of routes braided into the hair of escaped slaves, with a reference to Los Montes de Mar&iacute;a where the first palenque settlements were established.</p><p>In the end, each of these kinds of tracks fulfills the purpose of rap folkl&oacute;rico palenquero. &ldquo;This is what the town&rsquo;s residents have been looking for a long time,&rdquo; says Padilla Julio, &ldquo;a way for the younger generation to guarantee, in part, the future of San Basilio de Palenque&rsquo;s traditions.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>More on BBC Music&rsquo;s greatest hip-hop songs of all time: </strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">The 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time</a> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/slideshow-gallery/20191007-critics-on-the-10-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">What critics had to say about the top 10</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-who-voted\">Full list of critics who participated &ndash; and how they voted</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-greatest-hip-hop-song-poll-trends-and-surprises\">Trends and surprises in the poll</a> (<em>not available in UK</em>)<br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-why-are-there-so-few-women-in-best-of-hip-hop-polls\">Why are there so few women in hip-hop polls?</a> <br /> <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1eGrbfxp7ASnjPgAvO5TXU\">Playlist of the top 25 songs</a> (<em>Spotify</em>)</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Music","Name":"Music","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Title":"Music"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:45:29.825167Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"f4116c83-8471-486d-84d5-54261361cd89","Id":"wwculture/section/music","ModifiedDateTime":"2019-02-04T14:11:04.812279Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"section/music"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwculture/section/music","_id":"5e9820ad59dee61835057330"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2019-10-24T17:57:58Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"How hip-hop is saving a dying Colombian language","HeadlineShort":"The language being saved by hip-hop","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"In Colombia’s historic town of San Basilio de Palenque, hip-hop is helping resurrect a local language in danger of dying out.","IsSyndicated":true,"Latitude":"","Location":null,"Longitude":"","Option":[{"Content":{"Description":"Apple News Publish: Select to publish, remove to unpublish.

5 September, the day that German rapper OG Keemo released his new single 216, his Twitter timeline was headed by a retweet of one of his idols, American MC Earl Sweatshirt: &ldquo;I guess this the part where white people call me racist for being pro black,&rdquo; followed by the shrug emoji. A self-fulfilling prophecy, as it turned out.</p><p>For the next five days, in which Keemo&rsquo;s song and its accompanying, brutal visuals sent ripples through the German rap scene, his notoriously funny Twitter feed kept quiet. Apparently, the track&rsquo;s explicit imagery of everyday racism, black pride, self-hatred, and racial profiling left some feeling personally attacked.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish I wasn't the type of guy to read YouTube comments,&rdquo; OG Keemo says, laughing. &ldquo;People think because those themes don't directly affect them, they simply don't exist. I knew some people would get upset. But I never thought I would get called a full-blown racist for addressing their inherent racism.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since appearing on the scene in 2017, OG Keemo has been somewhat of an outlier in the current German rap landscape. The son of a Sudanese man who came to Germany in 1990, the 26-year-old is heralded as the future, mixing his thoughtful lyrics with street sensibilities. Growing up in the mid-90s between the southwestern cities of Mainz, Heidelberg and Mannheim (where he still resides today), Keemo was raised on a diet of Sade, Nelly, Coltrane and 50 Cent&rsquo;s Get Rich or Die Tryin&rsquo;.</p><p><strong>Stoic cool</strong></p><p>Stylistically, he is an MC of the post-everything ilk who has mastered rap as a native language in itself; the kind that makes you wonder how people could have ever struggled to hold a beat or find clean, multi-syllabic rhymes for every curse word in the dictionary. His musical tastes and his rapping abilities are truly advanced.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07s22nl\"}}</p><p>On his three latest releases Neptun, Skalp, and Otello, Keemo&rsquo;s biggest trick has been to perform his raps with the stoic cool of an unfazed, post-game NFL player.</p><p>This knack for code-switching became most apparent in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fz_UvJVEvg\">Vorwort</a>, his breakout song that defined the early stages of his career. In it, he moved effortlessly from punchlines about &ldquo;gliding through the streets like a manta ray&rdquo; to discussing his mother&rsquo;s passing mere days before signing his record deal; all wrapped up in one, hook-free stream of thought. In interviews and on his tracks, he&rsquo;s outspoken about his first and second passions in life being visual art and stealing stuff (he still engages in the former via his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv2PFJiFZnW/\">Joel Novelle Instagram</a> account).</p><blockquote><p> The 26-year-old is heralded as the future, mixing his thoughtful lyrics with street sensibilities </p></blockquote><p>Mix that with an infectious sense of humour, and you have an MC persona as complex as the times he tries to make sense of in the track 216.&nbsp;</p><p>For 216, OG Keemo tried a different writing approach. Instead of jotting down the lyrics in one go, the song consists of various lines he&rsquo;s written about different experiences of daily racism throughout his life. It&rsquo;s all held together by a recurring reference to his father who raised him on a &lsquo;by any means&rsquo; ideology, urging him to &ldquo;never turn the other cheek&rdquo;. The song culminates in the gripping depiction of an encounter with a racist policeman struggling to accept that his grandchildren are, in fact, mixed race.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ghost notes</strong></p><p>Sonically, 216 is as radio- and club-unfriendly as its lyrical content. The beat, as always provided by Keemo&rsquo;s producer and childhood friend Funkvater Frank, consists of little more than a few piano notes, rattling chains, scattered bits of sound design and some ghoulish screams at the song&rsquo;s peak. It&rsquo;s a fittingly odd choice for the lead-single of their upcoming debut album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zTfAD8KYhE\">Geist (Ghost)</a>. This is particularly noteworthy since Geist will be released on Chimperator, a Stuttgart-based label still best known for initiating the rise of masked pop-rap star Cro.&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07s22hp\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;I guess people wouldn't have expected such a track from me, simply because I wasn't very political in my songs so far. To be perfectly honest, I was against dropping this first. I thought we should come out with a banger. But Frankie suggested that it would be a good idea to put this out as a first statement. Of course, 216 is one of the most poignant songs on the album, so he was completely right,&rdquo; says OG Keemo.</p><blockquote><p> &ldquo;I guess people wouldn't have expected such a track from me, simply because I wasn't very political in my songs so far&rdquo; &ndash; OG Keemo </p></blockquote><p>Presented without any further explanation, the title 216 had fans and critics wondering about its meaning. Most listeners speculated that the number in the title referred to a paragraph in the German Criminal Code concerned with &ldquo;killing on request&rdquo;. Keemo is quick to debunk that theory &ndash; he&rsquo;d rather leave it at that. However, one could see where this theory stems from; after all, it is Keemo, dressed up in the same white military uniform that he&rsquo;s wearing at the beginning of the clip, who kicks away the chair at his own hanging.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s this circular structure of every-day racism and self-destructive behaviour that Keemo finds most frustrating.</p><p>&ldquo;I don't say we're to be blamed for what's happening. On the other hand, I also don&rsquo;t feel &lsquo;It's an us-against-them scenario&rsquo;. The last thing I wanted to achieve with this song is create more division. But, my father came here around 1990 and I&rsquo;m shocked when he tells me that nothing ever changed,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;One of the comments I saw most frequently was &ldquo;this only applies to America, never to Germany&rdquo;. To me, this is evidence that people have no clue what is really going on here. Because we never address it.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07s226d\"}}</p><p>This unapologetic anger expressed in 216 couldn&rsquo;t be more timely. The single was released against the backdrop of the elections in Saxony and Brandenburg, in which the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49544781\">far-right AFD party surged in elections</a>, and the results were mostly met with a collective <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49549670\">sigh of relief</a> about how it could it have been even worse. It&rsquo;s this form of apathy and ignorance towards the struggle of others that 216 counters with anger directed at everyone who still chooses to not listen, even when they&rsquo;re told loud and clear by those affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That is exactly what I don't understand&rdquo;, says Keemo. &ldquo;For example, it would never occur to me say &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t get it, why are these women complaining all of a sudden? I never experienced sexism&rsquo;. Do you know what I mean? Or, as a heterosexual man, I could never take on a position to tell a gay man that it&rsquo;s not that bad in Germany. That behaviour is the most absurd to me.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>BBC Music&rsquo;s greatest hip-hop songs of all time: </strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">The 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time</a> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/slideshow-gallery/20191007-critics-on-the-10-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">What critics had to say about the top 10</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-who-voted\">Full list of critics who participated &ndash; and how they voted</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-why-juicy-is-the-greatest-hip-hop-song-of-all-time\">Why Juicy is number one</a> (<em>not available in UK</em>)<br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-greatest-hip-hop-song-poll-trends-and-surprises\">Trends and surprises in the poll</a> (<em>not available in UK</em>)<br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-why-are-there-so-few-women-in-best-of-hip-hop-polls\">Why are there so few women in hip-hop polls?</a> (<em>not available in UK</em>)<br /> <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1eGrbfxp7ASnjPgAvO5TXU\">Playlist of the top 25 songs</a> (<em>Spotify</em>)</p><p>--</p><p><em>If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>The Essential List</em></a><em>.

width=\"100%\" /></a></p><p>Innovations in hip-hop often don&rsquo;t happen when there are new stories to tell, but rather when those who have gone unseen are finally heard. This distinction allows for a spectrum of emotions from braggadocio, triumph, a tenderness for the familiar and a reckoning with displacement. That&rsquo;s the thesis of Sampa The Great&rsquo;s debut album, The Return.&nbsp;</p><p>Sampa Tembo, the 26-year-old rapper originally from Zambia, has taken her once conflicting identities and attempted to reconcile them. &ldquo;It's about spiritually going home to yourself, to the most you, you've ever been,&rdquo; she says over the phone from Melbourne, her home since 2018, where the sun is beginning to shine after a characteristically cool winter.&nbsp;</p><p>Sampa has carved out a position for herself in Australian music, winning the Australian Music Prize for Best Album of 2017, and a cash award of A$30,000 for her second mixtape, Birds and the BEE9. Signing to the UK imprint Ninja Tunes and the widespread acclaim for The Returnhas seen Sampa step up to take on the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rn6h5\"}}</p><p>But Melbourne, Sampa grew up in Botswana, and left there at 18 to explore the US. Studying at San Francisco&rsquo;s Academy of Art University, she moved around, making a stop in Los Angeles before a planned to return home. But off the back of advice from her sister, she moved to Australia in 2014, a country where she knew no one.&nbsp;</p><p>Music is Sampa&rsquo;s raison d'etre, but her nomadic lifestyle became the centre of her spiritual journey.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> &nbsp; When I walked outside I saw how multicultural [Australia] actually was. The hip-hop scene did not reflect that &ndash; Sampa The Great </p></blockquote><p>While living in Sydney, she discovered the Australian hip-hop scene. In the US, she had performed a string of slam poetry shows. She always imagined making music for others, so began studying audio engineering at SAE. The industry &ldquo;was male-dominated and it was definitely white, which was very interesting to me,&rdquo; says Sampa. &ldquo;Especially knowing hip-hop and its origins. But more so it didn't reflect Australia or what I saw as a uni student.&rdquo;</p><p>During this time, what&rsquo;s affectionately referred to as &lsquo;Larrikin rap&rsquo; dominated the Australian charts. Characterised by young white men seen as good-hearted mavericks, artists like Hilltop Hoods, Bliss N Eso, Pez, and 360 wrote songs about trips to music festivals and drinking beers in the sun.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;When I walked outside I saw how multicultural [Australia] actually was,&rdquo; Sampa continues. &ldquo;The hip-hop scene did not reflect that. [Something] I didn't see was black female hip-hop artists.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2014, Sampa added Great to her stage name. The suffix would serve as a reminder whenever the outsideworld felt like it was closing in around her. But the release of her debut The Great Mixtapein 2015, didn&rsquo;t just signal the start of an unexpected career change, but the dawn of a new age in Australian hip-hop.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rn87x\"}}</p><p>Fellow Australian Iggy Azalea&rsquo;s rise to mainstream success saw her claim a one-two US Billboard chart position last held by The Beatles. But while the rest of the world was enamoured with Azalea, whose pop-rap crudely parodied black women from the southern states, she was destined to fizzle out by the end of 2018. Australian hip-hop, meanwhile, was simultaneously going through a metamorphosis.&nbsp;</p><p>Sampa bore witness to this, and in one fell swoop became a part of a scene involving indigenous rappers such as Briggs, Baker Boy, and Brothablack, as well as rappers coming to Australia from other countries, such as Manu Crooks, Jesswar, and Kwame. But even as Sampa&rsquo;s acerbic bars became entrenched in the Australian hip-hop music scene, she felt like something was amiss.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything to do with Sampa The Great professionally started out here in Australia but I was born and raised in Botswana and Zambia,&rdquo; says Sampa. &ldquo;And to not have those two worlds meet caused a lot of frustration that resulted in me not being content [despite] really amazing things happening in my career. I was not home.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> I just wanted those two worlds to be connected, but also the journey of why those two places are separated to be talked about &ndash; Sampa The Great </p></blockquote><p>There is African iconography in Sampa&rsquo;s work, but her identity had been tied to a place that didn&rsquo;t feel like home. &ldquo;Usually when you look at the news, all these Sampa The Great stories [have] Australia behind my name.&rdquo; And in an attempt to connect her life in Australia and her position in the hip-hop scene to her home in Botswana and Zambia, Sampa recorded The Return<em>. </em>&ldquo;I just wanted those two worlds to be connected, but also the journey of why those two places are separated to be talked about. The album takes you through that journey.&rdquo;</p><p>Sampa&rsquo;s discontentment isn&rsquo;t unique, which is pivotal to the overarching journey of her record. The 10-minute long title track The Return is a sprawling examination of displacement featuring Brooklyn rapper Whosane, Hiatus Kayiote's Silent Jay, Zimbabwean-born artist Thando and the mysterious Alien.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You know after that session we broke down actually, we all cried,&rdquo; Sampa admits with a wry laugh. &ldquo;[Identity] is a topic that is really deep especially to the diaspora. It&rsquo;s a no-go area for some so I was just happy that people were able to be super vulnerable knowing that the world would share their stories and their pain. For me, I didn't want the topic of home to just solely be on my story. Throughout the album, you hear my journey and my story of home, but it's not the only story. It's a branch of a really big tree, and so with The Return<em>,</em> we actually stepped down with a lot of our friends and a lot of our communities who struggle with &lsquo;home&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rn7ps\"}}</p><p>For many people in Australia, the idea of home is a foreign feeling. Australia&rsquo;s increasingly draconian immigration policies, refusal to cede sovereignty to indigenous people, and an at times combative and racist atmosphere have severed that connection. &ldquo;There are people who can't even go home or people whose home we're on, who don't feel like they're &lsquo;home&rsquo;,&rdquo; Sampa laments. Confining asylum seekers to offshore detention centres, the Australian government recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/world/australia/australia-manus-suicide.html\">reiterated their dedication to a hostile approach</a>.</p><p>Even though Sampa wants her African roots to be at the forefront, she understands her importance to Australian hip-hop. &ldquo;I know that representation-wise, I&rsquo;ve definitely added my stamp to the spectrum,&rdquo; says Sampa. But she wants more for the hip-hop artists in her adopted home. &ldquo;We don't want to just be seen or heard [but] we want to create avenues [to ensure] that this is not a trend for us.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> I don't choose to do any political music &ndash; my life is political - Sampa The Great </p></blockquote><p>The Return isn&rsquo;t just a meditation on diaspora, discontentment, and homesickness, but a celebration of her family. The opening track, Mwana, features Sampa&rsquo;s mother and her sister Mwanje. &ldquo;I mean, we sing [together] all the time anyway,&rdquo; Sampa cackles. &ldquo;We've been performing for our parents in our living room since we were young so it was really beautiful.&rdquo; Her sister isn&rsquo;t just a guest feature but the impetus and inspiration behind Sampa&rsquo;s ambassadorial role for young Africans in Australia, which at first terrified her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn't know the history of anything of the country itself, or the hip-hop scene, and I felt like this ambassadorial role was being thrust upon me,&rdquo; she says. The first interlude of the album, Wake Up, a recorded voicemail from a friend pinpoints this moment. &ldquo;Your phone's still off,&rdquo; the voicemail begins.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, I get what you're dealing with a hundred percent</p><p>And it's really hard and it's rough</p><p>But we're black</p><p>And you're black in the music industry, no less</p><p>This is just how it is</p><p>You just have to be able to deal.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rn719\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her talking to the pressure I received as a black artist here,&rdquo; Sampa says. &ldquo;The responsibility that comes with that is really huge [but] I think I have a new perspective now that my sister is here. Just having that perception of someone close to me, and knowing that, that the ripple effect of [my presence] would affect everybody else for me helped me deal with that pressure.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Sampa might be better at dealing with the pressure of her ambassadorial role but with the burgeoning success of The Returnacross the world, she&rsquo;s aware of her lifelong political journey.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don't choose to do any political music,&rdquo; she tells me. &ldquo;My life is political. This is the life experience of a black woman and because there's not that much representation in hip-hop, it will automatically be political.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>More on BBC Music&rsquo;s greatest hip-hop songs of all time: </strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">The 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time</a> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/slideshow-gallery/20191007-critics-on-the-10-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">What critics had to say about the top 10</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-who-voted\">Full list of critics who participated &ndash; and how they voted</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-greatest-hip-hop-song-poll-trends-and-surprises\">Trends and surprises in the poll</a> (<em>not available in UK</em>)<br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-why-are-there-so-few-women-in-best-of-hip-hop-polls\">Why are there so few women in hip-hop polls?</a> <br /> <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1eGrbfxp7ASnjPgAvO5TXU\">Playlist of the top 25 songs</a> (<em>Spotify</em>)</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Music","Name":"Music","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Title":"Music"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:45:29.825167Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"f4116c83-8471-486d-84d5-54261361cd89","Id":"wwculture/section/music","ModifiedDateTime":"2019-02-04T14:11:04.812279Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"section/music"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwculture/section/music","_id":"5e9820ad59dee61835057330"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2019-10-23T10:40:59.986Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Sampa The Great: The African voice of Australian rap","HeadlineShort":"An African voice revitalising rap music","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"Born in Botswana and raised in Zambia, Sampa The Great is one of Australia’s rising hip-hop stars.","IsSyndicated":true,"Latitude":"","Location":null,"Longitude":"","Option":[{"Content":{"Description":"Apple News Publish: Select to publish, remove to unpublish.

width=\"100%\" /></a></p><p>If you haven't heard of Young Thug, the chances are you've heard someone who sounds like Young Thug. The Atlanta rapper, born Jeffery Lamar Williams, has been a growing force in hip-hop for the better part of a decade. His instantly recognisable alto has been slithering and crawling its way up the charts for almost a decade, but the last 24 months have seen Thug rise to become the sun king at the centre of rap&rsquo;s solar system.</p><p>In 2019, Young Thug became his own genre. He won his first Grammy for backing vocals and ad-libs on Childish Gambino&rsquo;s This is America. Thug's last album So Much Fun debuted at number one in the United States, a commercial culmination that displayed the artist&rsquo;s musical contrasts in all their glory. It&rsquo;s his answer to Lil Wayne&rsquo;s career-defining Tha Carter III, a smartly-constructed distillation of his appeal &ndash; more coronation than a classic &ndash; diluting his berserk experimentation in favour of a restrained fluorescent joy that could appeal to suburban teens discovering vape pens and rap for the first time.</p><p>As well as topping the album chart, he briefly occupied 11 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, including his Post Malone collaboration, Goodbyes, which still receives over a million streams daily. And yet, Thugga's most impressive legacy is his army of imitators; young artists who discovered that there's money and fame to be made from idiosyncratic rhymes and unconventional sounds.</p><p>In the early 2010s Thug emerged from Atlanta, the city that has largely set the tone for hip-hop across this decade. The conventional narrative around Thug&rsquo;s convention-melting screeches and warbles always considered him far too extraterrestrial, idiosyncratic, and hostile to the promotional demands required to become the chart-topping festival-headlining star that his talent warranted.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rmfkh\"}}</p><p>Yet, the 10th of 11 children from the Jonesboro South projects in Atlanta has become ubiquitous on the Spotify US Top 50, even when he&rsquo;s not in plain sight. Consider Camilla Cabello, the ex-Fifth Harmony singer &ndash; her biggest solo record is Havana, her 2017 collaboration with Young Thug. Or Drake, the most commercially impactful rapper of the decade, who has repeatedly cribbed Thug&rsquo;s slippery electric-eel cadences, most notably on last year&rsquo;s track Mob Ties.</p><p>In rap, influence usually begins regionally and expands outward. So, it&rsquo;s unsurprising that practically every recent Atlanta artist owes paternity to the rapper briefly known as SEX. Take February&rsquo;s Three Headed Snake from Gunna, a rapper signed to Young Thug&rsquo;s label YSL. Last year, Gunna and another Thug prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Lil Baby, broke beyond the Rolling Loud discourse with Drip Too Hard, an unofficial spinoff of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3BizlMDH0\">Future and Thug&rsquo;s Drippin on Me</a>.</p><blockquote><p> Even someone as revolutionary as Thugger couldn&rsquo;t have existed without his acknowledged idol, Lil' Wayne </p></blockquote><p>The difference between homage, imitation, and apprenticeship may remain forever murky. The old rap line held that no <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=biting\">biting</a> was allowed was summed up by Wu Tang Clan&rsquo;s Raekwon: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want no one sounding like me on no album.&rdquo; A more equanimous view came from TS Eliot: &ldquo;Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different.&rdquo; Even someone as revolutionary as Thugger couldn&rsquo;t have existed without his acknowledged idol, Lil Wayne, whose slurred codeine hexes splintered rap&rsquo;s possibilities in a thousand directions.</p><p>Listening to Thug&rsquo;s first mixtapes from the beginning of the decade, the dragon-in-couture croak and Jabberwocky rhyme schemes that followed are absent. It&rsquo;s all muted riffs on Wayne. Even on his first notable project, 2011&rsquo;s I Came From Nothing 2, he remains in thrall to his hero, though songs like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6iQAEL7fHA\">Keep In Touch</a> revealed his limitless potential. Like all of Thug&rsquo;s best work, the track is resistant to critical rambling. It&rsquo;s built on puppy-dog romanticism that could have come from Motown&hellip; if it were hijacked by a 6-foot-4-inch nose-ringed, gambling-obsessed, ex-high school quarterback from the slums.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rmd5h\"}}</p><p>Young Thug&rsquo;s breakthrough came with 2013&rsquo;s Stoner. It was an entirely different species from what had come before, forged from a DNA mutation whose bloodstream was equal parts strawberry jolly rancher, promethazine, weed, molly, and esoteric powders beamed in from the plug on Betelgeuse.</p><p>On Stoner, he shrieks and moans, vomiting nightmare cantillations and euphoric wails, stretching syllables until they collapse under the stress, disappearing into the vanishing point. He spell-screams &ldquo;L-E-A-N-I-N-G&rdquo; like a spoiled child begging to open his Christmas presents early, but discovering that the only things under the tree are Styrofoam and codeine. Thug&rsquo;s voice contorts into neon lava; he uses it like Jimi Hendrix using a wah-wah-pedal. It&rsquo;s a live power cord writhing in the street during a lightning storm.</p><blockquote><p> It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to guess who will end up surpassing him, or at least annexing new territory </p></blockquote><p>The next three years marked a run that can match nearly any creative streak in history. There was the Rich Gang project with fellow Atlanta MC Rich Homie Quan (whose own stylistic influence is often overlooked), which somehow fulfilled Quan&rsquo;s boast that they were the &ldquo;hardest duo since OutKast&rdquo;. As for Thug&rsquo;s solo work, the first two volumes of the Slime Season series are deliriously improvised masterpieces, often overlooked because like Rich Gang, they never made it onto streaming services. The zenith may have been 2015&rsquo;s Barter 6, his first project made available for commercial release. There&rsquo;s arguably his most innovative song, Halftime, where he introduces half-a-dozen different flows, switching direction with the startling agility and blinding speed of a Simone Biles floor routine.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rmcnr\"}}</p><p>To date, his rap family hasn&rsquo;t captured the full summation of what has made Thug immortal. Each of his proteges seem to work within a small parcel of his flows, melodies and vocal textures. It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to guess who will end up surpassing him, or at least annexing new territory. It could be his &ldquo;little brothers&rdquo; Gunna and Lil Baby, whose collaboration Drip or Drown 2 reached number three on the Billboard album charts earlier this year. This summer, Thug and Future announced that the little brothers would join their elders for a Super Slimey sequel, forming an Atlanta rap Avengers.</p><blockquote><p> Weighing art is more complex and inscrutable than merely playing a game of spot the influence </p></blockquote><p>That said, there is an argument that the first half-generation of Thug-influenced rappers have already transformed his innovations into something singular. Travis Scott famously cribbed Thug&rsquo;s Pick Up the Phone for one of his first huge solo hits, and it&rsquo;s obvious that the Houston rapper&rsquo;s ad-libs, vocal pitch and melodies are derived from Thug, albeit blended with 808s and Yeezus-era Kanye).</p><p>Playboi Carti has become one of the biggest artists of the moment by triangulating Chicago artist Chief Keef with Thug. Philadelphia-born Lil Uzi Vert rapped like Meek Mill until he moved to Atlanta, signed to DJ Drama&rsquo;s label, and popped up on Slime Season 2.</p><p>Of course, weighing art is more complex and inscrutable than merely playing a game of spot the influence. A hit song like Lil Uzi Vert&rsquo;s XO Tour Llif3 was clearly informed by Uzi&rsquo;s own life and emotions, not to mention the mall punk of the last decade. But it&rsquo;s hard to imagine it existing or having the impact it did without Young Thug laying the foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07rmgp2\"}}</p><p>It&rsquo;s been 20 years since that MTV Music Awards where Eminem famously stormed the stage with a hundred lookalikes with bleached hair, white tees, and blue jeans. The idea was that he embodied the millions of aggrieved middle-American white boys obsessed with rap, who up until that point hadn&rsquo;t seen themselves credibly represented within the genre. For a year or two after Eminem blew up, every major label attempted to trot out their own Eminem replicant, but none survived (save for a few classic Bubba Sparxx singles).</p><p>But now tastes and music distribution models have changed, and with it, the desire to hear artists that are better or at least different. If you were going to redo that same awards show today, you might do it with 100 Young Thugs standing in a straight line onstage, the alien visionary at the forefront, his descendants in designer clothes and dyed hair, taking his cue and rapping along simultaneously. It would be hard to hear the difference over the sound of the applause.</p><p><strong>More on BBC Music&rsquo;s greatest hip-hop songs of all time: </strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">The 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time</a> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/slideshow-gallery/20191007-critics-on-the-10-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">What critics had to say about the top 10</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-who-voted\">Full list of critics who participated &ndash; and how they voted</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-greatest-hip-hop-song-poll-trends-and-surprises\">Trends and surprises in the poll</a> (<em>not available in UK</em>)<br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-why-are-there-so-few-women-in-best-of-hip-hop-polls\">Why are there so few women in hip-hop polls?</a> <br /> <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1eGrbfxp7ASnjPgAvO5TXU\">Playlist of the top 25 songs</a> (<em>Spotify</em>)</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Music","Name":"Music","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Title":"Music"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:45:29.825167Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"f4116c83-8471-486d-84d5-54261361cd89","Id":"wwculture/section/music","ModifiedDateTime":"2019-02-04T14:11:04.812279Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"section/music"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwculture/section/music","_id":"5e9820ad59dee61835057330"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2019-10-21T14:34:07.861Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Why Young Thug is the 21st Century’s most influential rapper","HeadlineShort":"Is this the century's biggest rapper?","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"The Atlanta star has become his own genre; he is the sun king at the centre of rap’s solar system","IsSyndicated":false,"Latitude":"","Location":null,"Longitude":"","Option":[{"Content":{"Description":"Apple News Publish: Select to publish, remove to unpublish.

width=\"100%\" /> </a></p><p>The global growth of hip-hop is best measured in decades. After Rapper&rsquo;s Delight took over the radio waves at the end of the 1970s, New York became the superheated centre of this brave new sound. Throughout the &rsquo;80s, hip-hop remained largely a localised scene. Turntablists like DJ Kool Herc were scratching and spinning records in the Bronx, Run DMC were making rock-influenced tracks in Queens, and Kurtis Blow was spitting narrative rhymes up in Harlem.</p><p>The 1990s saw an explosion of the sound across the US. Every region developed their own sonic signature, from the kaleidoscopically funky tracks that Virginia-native Missy Elliott dropped to the chopped and screwed rhythms of Port Arthur, TX&rsquo;s UGK and the soul-and-gospel inflected rhymes of Chicago&rsquo;s Common. (The year 1990 was also the first time a hip-hop song took the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100. Sadly, it was Vanilla Ice&rsquo;s Ice Ice Baby.)</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07r368q\"}}</p><p>When the Millennium arrived, hip-hop started to creep into the mainstream narrative around pop culture. The sound was everywhere, as the green shoots of its international rise were beginning to show, with artists like MIA. and Dizzee Rascal becoming international stars.</p><p>The past decade has entrenched hip hop as not only a permanent part of pop culture, but as pop culture itself. Hip-hop is how people speak about themselves from Kashmir to California. The genre that was once so tightly defined has started endless branches of new genres. Hip-hop doesn&rsquo;t just belong to the Bronx anymore. It&rsquo;s everywhere.</p><p>As a result, we felt it was the right time to ask critics around the world what they think are the greatest hip-hop songs of all time. No surprises to see that almost all of the 280 songs nominated in total are from US artists. But we also received nominations for songs originating outside the US. As the purpose of these lists should be to encourage discovery as well as debate, we thought we would put together a list of the critic&rsquo;s picks from around the world to create a global playlist. Here are the standouts from the critics&rsquo; picks that show hip-hop&rsquo;s five decades of growth into a global phenomenon.</p><p><strong><em>Shinjitsu No Dangan, King Giddra (1995)<br /> </em></strong>Just because international hip-hop didn&rsquo;t hit the big time until the noughties doesn&rsquo;t mean there weren&rsquo;t artists trying to bring the genre to their own shores. King Giddra &ndash; not to be confused with MF DOOM&rsquo;s alias King Gheedorah &ndash; was a Japanese group which took political cues from groups like Public Enemy, highlighting the stark economic reality for many Japanese people in the shadow of a deep recession. Musically, Shinjitsu No Dangan (Bullet of Truth) is a mixture of East coast boom-bap and the rock-tinged sound of Cypress Hill. Production-wise it may not be terribly innovative, but the song is full of fire.</p><p><strong><em>Je Danse Le Mia, IAM (1994)<br /> </em></strong>If you ask any hip-hop head where the best non-English rap hails from, the answer is invariably France. IAM came to prominence in the early &rsquo;90s, taking equal cues from New Jack Swing and R&amp;B. Je Danse Le Mia reached number one in France, and stayed there for weeks, inspiring a whole new generation of hip-hop artists who saw that the genre had star-making potential. The song toes the line between goofy and infectious, with a funk-injected beat that wouldn&rsquo;t have been out of place in the 1970s.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07r3600\"}}</p><p><strong><em>I Luv U, Dizzee Rascal (2003)<br /> </em></strong>Whether grime is hip-hop or not is a debate that still rages today, but no one can argue that Dizzee Rascal brought the uniquely English genre to the world&rsquo;s stage. The beat and flow of Dizzee&rsquo;s hit is proto-grime, all aggressive jungle and garage beats over rapid-fire rhymes that still sound smooth at 140bpm. I Luv U didn&rsquo;t start grime, but it did catapult it into the public consciousness.</p><p><strong><em>Soweto, Pro Kid (2005)<br /> </em></strong>There are rappers that put entire cities on the map. Think Meek Mill and Philadelphia or Drake and Toronto. Soweto&rsquo;s Pro Kid was another one of these, popularising a regional hip-hop style born and bred in the famed Johannesburg suburb. Soweto has all the triumphant swagger of Jay-Z or Rick Ross rhyming over a vintage Just Blaze beat, but Pro Kid also brought a distinctive vocabulary of Sowetan slang and vernacular to the table, creating something sublime in the process.</p><p><strong><em>How to Rap About Africa, Black Vulcanite (2016)<br /> </em></strong>In 2005, Kenyan author and journalist Binyavanga Wainaina wrote a satiric essay labeled <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/05/22/725808622/binyavanga-wainaina-tells-us-how-to-write-about-africa\">How to Write About Africa</a>. It became a landmark piece of criticism, lampooning those who would come to the continent and follow a tired formula that highlighted stereotypical narratives about poverty, genocide, and corruption. A decade later, the Namibian group Black Vulcanite put Wainaina&rsquo;s essay to music, giving it a seething beat that takes cues from iconic producers like DJ Premier and Madlib. The resulting track, How to Rap About Africa, is less tongue-in-cheek and more caustically critical, bringing the anti-establishment fire of Public Enemy and Dead Prez to a whole new era and geography.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Sub City, Stogie T (2016)<br /> </em></strong>South Africa&rsquo;s hip-hop scene is one of the world&rsquo;s most mature, and it has produced some of the most artistically gifted MCs this side of Queens. But even in that crowded field, Stogie T stands apart. The 38-year old MC famously flexed his skills on radio show Sway in the Morning, spitting a flawless freestyle over the beat from Nas&rsquo;s NY State of Mind. It was a star-making moment, but Stogie T has been rhyming since the turn of the millennium, including the standout track Sub City from his eponymous 2016 album.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07r35dr\"}}</p><p><strong><em>Ngqangqa, Kanyi (2017)<br /> </em></strong>As hip hop became a dominant musical force, it also became an outlet for those seeking to keep their own oral and narrative traditions alive in an era of cultural homogenisation. Kanyi Mavi, an MC hailing from Cape Town, raps in Xhosa &ndash; a language spoken by more than eight million South Africans that contains distinctive &ldquo;click&rdquo; consonants. Mavi&rsquo;s rapping is studded with those clicks, giving the austere, gritty beat on her 2017 track Ngqangqa another layer that would be impossible to add using another language.</p><p><strong><em>Fight da Faida, Frankie Hi-NRG MC (1993)<br /> </em></strong>Italy may not be the first country you think of when it comes to hip-hop, but Frankie Hi-NRG MC has been in the game as long as legendary acts like Common and UGK. His debut single is as politically charged as any Public Enemy track, railing against the influence of the mafia in Sicily on a sparse, springy beat centered around a Sly and the Family Stone sample. Frankie does his best Ice Cube impression on Fight da Faida, knowing that understated style can be the most devastating way to deliver a rhyme.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Atrevido, Orishas (2000)<br /> </em></strong>Most of the songs on this list sound like American hip-hop. Atrevido, a track from Cuban rap group Orishas, doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s hip-hop by artists intimately familiar with Cuba&rsquo;s manifold musical traditions, from rumba to bolero to jazz, yielding a sound that could fit comfortably into any number of genres. Orishas&rsquo; ability to shape shift and blend heritage with modern tastes has inspired artists from Bad Bunny to Camilla Cabello, and made the Caribbean one of the modern powerhouses of contemporary hip-hop.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>More on BBC Music&rsquo;s greatest hip-hop songs of all time: </strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">The 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time</a> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/slideshow-gallery/20191007-critics-on-the-10-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">What critics had to say about the top 10</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-who-voted\">Full list of critics who participated &ndash; and how they voted</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-why-juicy-is-the-greatest-hip-hop-song-of-all-time\">Why Juicy is number one</a> (<em>not available in UK</em>)<br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-greatest-hip-hop-song-poll-trends-and-surprises\">Trends and surprises in the poll</a> (<em>not available in UK</em>)<br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-why-are-there-so-few-women-in-best-of-hip-hop-polls\">Why are there so few women in hip-hop polls?</a> (<em>not available in UK</em>)<br /> <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1eGrbfxp7ASnjPgAvO5TXU\">Playlist of the top 25 songs</a> (<em>Spotify</em>)</p><p><em><strong>How many of these songs do you agree with?

href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/tags/greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\"> <img src=\"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/raw/p07qd4qy.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Greatest hip-hop songs of all time\" width=\"100%\" /></a></p><p>There&rsquo;s one song in hip-hop that embodies the culture perfectly. It&rsquo;s an homage to the past with hope for the future. Steeped in the harsh reality of the streets while being markedly optimistic, it&rsquo;s the rag-to-riches tale of the hustle &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why it rises to the top of the rap canon. BBC Music polled music journalists, critics, artists and industry experts, and the results are in. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">greatest hip-hop song of all time</a>, in their opinion, is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JZom_gVfuw\">Juicy by The Notorious B.I.G.</a>, aka Biggie Smalls.</p><p>The 1994 release is a watershed moment in the timeline of hip-hop, marking the official arrival of Biggie Smalls (born Christopher Wallace). Juicy is a modern bildungsroman of a young, black man growing up in Brooklyn. &ldquo;It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! Magazine,&rdquo; he recalls about his life. &ldquo;I made the change from a common thief/To up close and personal with Robin Leach.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07qdfxp\"}}</p><p>Tapping into his natural storytelling ability, Biggie vividly shares the story of the struggle, of being broke and overlooked. &ldquo;Born sinner, the opposite of a winner/Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner?&rdquo; he asks. Sure, he&rsquo;s flexing his braggadocio, but there&rsquo;s also touching vulnerability amid the machismo. &ldquo;Girls used to diss me/Now they write letters &rsquo;cause they miss me,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood/And it's still all good.&rdquo;</p><p>Juicy was heralded as a classic pretty much out of the gate, and it catapulted the 22-year-old into the upper echelons of rap. A self-fulfilling prophecy: a new rap king in the East was crowned</p><p>That rise &ndash; from when &ldquo;birthdays was the worst days&rdquo; to champagne-sipping glory &ndash; is the quintessential rap Cinderella tale. In that vein, Sean &ldquo;Diddy&rdquo; Combs served as Biggie&rsquo;s sonic steward and godfather. Diddy (or Pete Rock, depending on which version of the story you believe) tapped into a winning formula of flipping classic &rsquo;80s samples for the succulent beat. Mtume&rsquo;s No 1 R&amp;B hit Juicy Fruit adds an addictive melody and gives Biggie&rsquo;s hard rhymes an upbeat, feel-good vibe.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07qdfxq\"}}</p><p>Juicy is synonymous with hip-hop&rsquo;s ambitious ethos. It&rsquo;s become such a staple that every hip-hop head is expected to know the first verse by heart &ndash; at least. Biggie&rsquo;s life and career were cut tragically short in 1997. However, Diddy helped bolster the mythology of Juicy with the next generation by making it a key plot device on 2002&rsquo;s reality show Making The Band. Contestants were made to recite the song&rsquo;s bars out loud in order to prove their musical chops.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a universality in Juicy that enables it to stand the test of time, whether you grew up in the belly of Brooklyn&rsquo;s Bed-Stuy neighbourhood, or you experience your own daily struggle. Twenty-five years later, Biggie&rsquo;s uplifting message of perseverance, of better days, still resonates. We don&rsquo;t have him around anymore, but the aspiration he left behind continues to inspire. And it&rsquo;s all good.</p><p><strong>More on BBC Music&rsquo;s greatest hip-hop songs of all time: </strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">The 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time</a> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/slideshow-gallery/20191007-critics-on-the-10-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time\">What critics had to say about the top 10</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-who-voted\">Full list of critics who participated &ndash; and how they voted</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-greatest-hip-hop-song-poll-trends-and-surprises\">Trends and surprises in the poll</a> (<em>not available in UK</em>)<br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191007-why-are-there-so-few-women-in-best-of-hip-hop-polls\">Why are there so few women in hip-hop polls?</a> <br /> <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1eGrbfxp7ASnjPgAvO5TXU\">Playlist of the top 25 songs</a> (<em>Spotify</em>)</p><p><em><strong>How many of the songs in the poll do you agree with?
