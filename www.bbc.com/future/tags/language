Too much time has passed, and there has been too much influence from the colonial language, in this case English, for today&rsquo;s Barngarla to be a carbon copy.

And it all adds up.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the work of Dr Angela Nicoara, senior research scientist at the Deutsche Telekom Innovation Center in Silicon Valley. She has become something of a digital dietician, counting the joules that go into feeding our smartphones' appetites. She recently laid out her findings in \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww2012.wwwconference.org\u002Fproceedings\u002Fproceedings\u002Fp41.pdf\"\u003Ea report she enticingly called Who Killed My Battery?\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a collaboration with the group of Professor Dan Boneh at Stanford University, she connected a state of the art electronic meter to the battery of a smartphone, which typically store around 15-20,000 joules of energy, and then tracked the power for every millisecond it performed one of the most common applications for our handhelds: browsing the web.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat emerged when she broke down the actions millisecond by millisecond came as a surprise.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first was that just hitting the &ldquo;go&rdquo; button and getting the phone to contact the network used 12 joules, as the phone exchanged details with the local base station, agreed transmission settings and so on. That&rsquo;s before a single byte was downloaded. When that process begins, the real surprises come thick and fast.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out that the design of the web page has a massive impact on the energy it takes to put it on your mobile screen. For example, the BBC News website, specifically designed for mobile users, took another 3 joules to download and process all the bits for a news story. For the worst performer of the websites she explored, Apple.com, it took another 34 joules &ndash; 11 times more than the BBC. Wikipedia came just behind.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareless websites, she found, are at least contributors to killing her battery. For our PCs and laptops connected to the mains, these numbers don&rsquo;t matter. With the constraints of a mobile battery they are critical.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference between these websites was in the way that they were built. For example, interactive elements that are used to customise a site experience and often run in the background of a site were a big drain. A half of those 34 joules needed to see the Apple page were down to &nbsp;these functions, without them even being touched; on Wikipedia, they alone cost 10 joules.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother drain are the so-called CSS files that tell a browser how to layout the page. Again, on the Apple site, these required 12 joules to download and render onto the screen. Simple improvements reduce this by 5 joules.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach joule might seem a trivial amount, but like a slimmer on a diet lots of small savings soon add up &ndash; especially when some websites take eleven times as much energy to visit as others.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EElectronic warfare\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut website design is not the only drain on a phone&rsquo;s batteries. The way we access these websites &ndash; and in particular the settings our service providers use - also has a huge effect, according to Hari Balakrishnan, Fujitsu Professor of Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurprisingly, it is the network that decides what power setting our handsets use. When we need to transmit, the network tells our handsets to power up to maximum.&nbsp; But the network&rsquo;s interests are different from ours. We would like to power down again as soon possible to save our battery.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut only a slender portion of an already crowded radio spectrum is assigned for these so-called control messages, says Dr Balakrishnan. Because of that, the network tries to minimise the number of control signals it sends, even if that leaves our handset powering away while doing nothing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;&ldquo;A classic example,&rdquo; says Dr Balakrishnan, &ldquo;is when you&rsquo;re running an application that wakes up every 20 or 30 seconds and sends one byte of information. That would, in many cases, keep your radio in the high-power, active mode all the time. But it doesn&rsquo;t have to. That kind of trivial workload should consume next to no energy, but ends up using huge amounts of energy because of the sub-optimal controls implemented by the networks.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike Dr Nicoara, Dr Balakrishnan decided to test his suspicion by wiring his battery to a meter and watching the battery drain. The results showed that by letting the phone control its own settings, he could halve the power consumed by the wireless transmissions with minimal effect on the network performance (although he stresses the details change from device to device, and from network to network).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, these might seem small improvements overall &ndash; but a network that can give our phones a few more hours of working battery life is highly likely to attract more customers these days.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it wouldn't matter how long your phone was fired up to exchange bits with the base station, if it could do so with minimal energy. But it turns out the mobile industry has been fighting a war with its electronics for years because they are so inefficient.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, it is the purity of the radio wave that they use to connect to the base station that requires so much power.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith radio spectrum restricted (see the \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Ffuture\u002Fstory\u002F20130221-smart-networks-for-smartphones\"\u003Etwo previous\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Ffuture\u002Fstory\u002F20130212-mobiles-signal-dawning-crisis\"\u003Earticles\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in this series) transmission frequencies are squeezed in close together, and any distortion in the signal would lead to catastrophic interference. And it turns out that the basic physics of the amplifiers that drive the antennae can only generate those pure waves when drawing a lot of electrical current.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the 3G standards were introduced, manufacturers turned to a special design of amplifier first concocted back in the 1930s, because of the stringent demands of the networks. But even then, for every watt of transmitted radio power, there's more than another watt simply warming your handset to create this pure wave. Basically, simple physics is doubling the drain rate on your battery.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;The industry is racing furiously to mitigate this problem,&rdquo; says Joel Dawson, Professor of Power Engineering at MIT, who has himself come forward with a smart fix that involves electronically compensating for this distortion, something that could apparently halve the losses. But how soon any of those fixes will make it to the market remains to be seen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnergy harvest\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course these aren&rsquo;t the only drains on a battery. Modern smartphones pack everything from small accelerometers to energy hungry global positioning systems. And then there is the display - the whole selling point of the smart phone is the interface that lets you access the world wherever you are. Until researchers can develop electronic-inks similar to these used in the Kindle e-book or other pixelated passive systems that refresh as fast as lit screens, simply viewing the phone comes at a substantial cost.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe obvious solution would be to pack in a bigger battery, but of all the components in your handset, the battery is the one that represents seriously mature technology. Most of the electrochemistry was laid down a hundred years ago and, as one battery manufacturer confessed to me, there's little they can do about. The introduction of the rechargeable lithium-ion battery in the 1990s was something of a step change. But since then &hellip; well, while virtually every other phone parameter doubles in a year or two, it takes a decade to double battery performance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are ongoing efforts to improve battery technology (See: \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Ffuture\u002Fstory\u002F20120227-charging-tomorrows-smartphones\"\u003ECharging Tomorrow&rsquo;s smartphones\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) but there may also be another route: harvesting energy from the environment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar power is long-established, and has been tried many times with mobile phones, but has failed largely because of inconvenience. As the front of phones is crowded out with buttons, photovoltaic cells have largely been put on the back &ndash; but that has required turning a phone upside down to keep the battery charged.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the form of the modern smart phone, freeing up the top face, has changed all that. And one potential solution is on display at this week&rsquo;s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWYSIPS (&ldquo;What You See is the Photovoltaic Surface&rdquo;), as it is known, is a joke, according to Francis Robcis, sales director for the new product. &ldquo;Because you can&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; he explains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it needs to be like that, because WYSIPS has silicon solar cells embedded within the large smartphone display.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;Go into the office, and most people will leave their phones lying around with the face up,&rdquo; says Robcis. So that when the set is idle, the tiny silicon strips (too small to see) are busy recharging the battery.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge has been to integrate the photovoltaics into the display without dimming the image by more than 10 per cent &ndash; a reduction users should find acceptable. And to allow it to sit alongside the touchscreen function. If the system takes off, the future mobile screen could become a busy place.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe company hopes to have a pilot line producing screens by the end of the year, to prove the technology is viable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowering by sunlight, of course, is conventional, even if unfamiliar in mobile phones. At the University of Washington Seattle, ex-Intel researcher Joshua Smith is planning something much more radical: powering mobile phones - with gratifying circularity - by radio waves.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis lab, funded by tech giants Intel and Google, has already made great strides. &ldquo;The largest TV towers in the US put out around a megawatt of energy,&rdquo; Smith explains. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re able to operate our energy harvester as much as 30 km from one and get small but usable amounts of energy.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn essence, harvesting radio energy requires rewiring the phone antenna to extract not the signal but the power of the carrier wave. And it&rsquo;s not only powerful TV transmissions that you can tap into. Recently, Smith&rsquo;s lab has been able to harvest energy from mobile phone masts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe quantities available are down in the microwatt range, so not enough to power voice transmissions. But enough energy can be accumulated, Smith says, to send short texts, or just to stretch the battery life.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;It would be enough to have perpetual standby. My favourite example is driving along in my car. My son is playing Angry Birds on the cell phone, and completely drains the battery. And then I get a flat tyre. It would be nice if I could send an emergency SMS using this ambient energy. And of course, compared to solar power, you could even do it at night.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of which means that the daily ritual of recharging your phone could soon be a thing of the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIf you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002FBBCFuture\"\u003EFacebook page\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cem\u003E or message us on \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002F#%21\u002FBBC_Future\"\u003ETwitter\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20130227-what-is-killing-smartphones-0"}],"collection":[],"disableAdverts":false,"displayDate":"2014-11-18T09:16:36Z","embeddedCustomHtml":"","embeddedInfographicUrl":"","embeddedType":"","geolocation":null,"headlineLong":"What is killing smartphones?","headlineShort":"What is killing smartphones?","image":[],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageAltText":"","isSyndicated":false,"latitude":"","location":null,"longitude":"","mpsVideo":"","option":null,"partner":null,"primaryVertical":"future","promoAlignment":"centre","promoAltText":"","promoImage":[],"relatedStories":[],"relatedTag":null,"summaryLong":"What drains a smartphone battery so quickly... and what can be done about it?","summaryShort":"And what is being done about it?","tag":[],"creationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:36Z","entity":"article","guid":"d2d6f5b9-7af1-4deb-8602-db188bd4d257","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20130227-what-is-killing-smartphones","modifiedDateTime":"2019-10-04T14:35:10.266973Z","project":"future","slug":"20130227-what-is-killing-smartphones","cacheLastUpdated":1587442990598},"future\u002Farticle\u002F20161027-how-smart-homes-have-become-the-haunted-houses-of-today":{"urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:article:future\u002Farticle\u002F20161027-how-smart-homes-have-become-the-haunted-houses-of-today","_id":"5e982097272a584021aaf7e0","ambientVideo":"","articleType":"story","assetVideo":null,"author":[],"bodyIntro":"Our close relationship with technology has made it easy for our devices to creep us out","businessUnit":"worldwide","cards":[{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"calloutBodyHtml":"\u003Cp\u003EThis article was inspired by a \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.co.uk\u002Fprogrammes\u002Fb080t0p9\"\u003EBBC Radio 4 episode of Digital Human\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which is available as a podcast from Monday 31 October.

Courtesy of the internet, the furore around ogooglebar is likely only to spread its usage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are larger concerns at stake here, however. I&rsquo;ve spent much of the last year writing \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ftomchatfield.net\u002F\"\u003Ea book about language and technology\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, and the rise of &ldquo;ungooglable&rdquo; and its international equivalents marks one of the most characteristic linguistic evolutions of our age: binary vocabulary.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUnfollow, unfriend\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo take just a handful of terms, consider what it means to &ldquo;like&rdquo; and to &ldquo;unlike&rdquo;, or to &ldquo;favourite&rdquo; and to &ldquo;unfavourite&rdquo;; how you can &ldquo;follow&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfollow&rdquo;, or &ldquo;friend&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfriend&rdquo;, other people; and how you constantly &ldquo;click&rdquo; or &ldquo;unclick&rdquo; onscreen boxes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn each case, what&rsquo;s on offer is a near-miraculous promise of agency: the possibility of words and actions that are, unlike those taking place in the real world, entirely reversible. There&rsquo;s nothing that cannot be undone in an instant, then done again at will (the word &ldquo;undone&rdquo; itself has existed in English for around 700 years but, when Shakespeare and his predecessors used it, they usually implied death or destruction: a far cry from pressing &ldquo;Ctrl-Z&rdquo; on a keyboard).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven &ldquo;ungoogleable&rdquo; has a reassuring kind of certainty to it. On the one hand lies the ordered, searchable realm within which we conduct our daily digital business. On the other, there&rsquo;s the stuff we&rsquo;re best off not worrying about: a \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.co.uk\u002Fnews\u002Fmagazine-21956743\"\u003Emessy, unsearachable space\u003C\u002Fa\u003E spanning everything from cyber-dissidents to criminals, via paywalls and anonymous networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept, of course, the boxes of online experience are never quite as tidy as they seem. &ldquo;Untag&rdquo; yourself from an embarrassing public image &ndash; or indeed from an image that doesn&rsquo;t actually show you at all &ndash; and both the deed and the undeed will remain recorded forever. Unfollow or unfriend someone you know and they will vanish from view &ndash; but they may well never forget or forgive. No matter how many times you click undo, the machine records and remembers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReversible words promise a kind of perpetual present, in which everything can always be exactly the way you want it (provided you only feel one of two ways). Yet data itself only accumulates. Whether you consider yourself to be ogooglebar or not, the digital book of your life is steadily being written within somebody&rsquo;s servers &ndash; and few of its words will ever be unwritten.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E&lsquo;Ugly gloop&rsquo;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of which makes the ownership of words an important battleground. In Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s Alice Through The Looking Glass, Humpty Dumpty explains to Alice that &ldquo;When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean &ndash; neither more nor less.&rdquo; Carroll was using absurdity to make a simple point: language is something we build together, and I can no more choose the precise meaning of my words than I can decide which laws of physics apply to me. Google, however, seem determined to play Humpty Dumpty &ndash; and in the process to make a very particular kind of binary claim. Either you use &ldquo;Google&rdquo; their way, or you don&rsquo;t get to use it all.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommercial imperatives may be at stake, not least around the vexed question of trademarks, but there&rsquo;s also an old-fashioned petulance to this insistence: as if official approval still governed the way we judge language. Given that most of us are likely simply to type a word into Google if we want to check its meaning, this puts the company in a curiously invidious position. Should it describe words as people are using them, or suggest in certain cases how things &ldquo;ought&rdquo; to be?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccurately reflecting the world has always been a sacrosanct principle for search. When it comes to language, though, every act of selection and interconnection itself adds another layer of meaning (just start typing into a search box to find out what auto-completed ideas are associated with your name). &nbsp;If you can&rsquo;t find something online, it&rsquo;s often because you lack the right words. And there&rsquo;s a deliciously circular logic to all this, whereby what&rsquo;s &ldquo;right&rdquo; means only what displays the best search results &ndash; just as what you yourself &ldquo;like&rdquo; is defined by the boxes you&rsquo;ve ticked.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, then, the Swedish Language Council&rsquo;s statement of language&rsquo;s independence from influence may not be quite as convincing as it seems. While no individual can decide the future of language, does the same apply to the software through which so many millions of our words flow each day?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;Ungooglable&rdquo; is an ugly gloop of a word (ogooglebar is much more mellifluous), but it&rsquo;s also a tribute to a certain species of contemporary power &ndash; and the ways in which some tools can shape not only how we communicate, but what we say, what we&rsquo;re not allowed to say, and what the world thinks we mean. Language online may seem a simple, binary business. But there&rsquo;s always more to be said at the margins of words.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDo you agree with Tom?

Speaking with slightly pouted lips instantly makes you sound a little bit more French, for instance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, he says you should try to overcome the embarrassment associated with producing \"strange\" noises &ndash; such as the guttural sounds in Arabic, for instance. &ldquo;You have to realise it&rsquo;s not foreign to us &ndash; when you are disgusted, you already say &lsquo;eugh&rsquo;. And if you acknowledge and give your subconscious permission to do it in speech, you can make the sound.&rdquo; That may sound a little silly, but the point is that all this should help you to get over your natural inhibitions. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all to do with owning the language, which is what actors have to do to make the audience believe that these words are yours.

Also, grammar is different from meaning, which is why an active sentence like \u003Cem\u003EHobbes tackled Calvin \u003C\u002Fem\u003Econveys roughly the same meaning as the passive \u003Cem\u003ECalvin was tackled by Hobbes\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, though they differ in the sequencing of their grammatical structure.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EIn addition, grammars are made up of groupings of units.

For example, this order appears when people arrange pictures to describe events from an animated cartoon, or when speaking adults communicate using only gestures. It also appears in the gesture systems created by deaf children who cannot hear spoken languages and are not exposed to sign languages. In Goldin-Meadow&rsquo;s book The Resilience of Language, she describes the children as lacking exposure to a language and thus invent their own manual systems to communicate, called &ldquo;homesigns&rdquo;.

Language might be described as the ability to take a finite set of elements (such as words), and using a set of rules (grammar and syntax) to create infinite combinations, each of which is comprehensible. Given this definition, it is perhaps not surprising then that cognitive psychologists sometimes speak of a \"grammar of action\".\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike sentences, the catalogue of human actions is infinite. We stretch, bend, and kick. We build bridges and prepare meals. We perform an endless variety of dance routines. We make paper airplanes. A complex action, like hammering a nail, can be broken down into its constituent actions &ndash; grasping, striking, reaching &ndash; just as a sentence can be broken into its units &ndash; nouns, verbs, adjectives. In 1951, cognitive psychologist Karl Lashley proposed a link \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fs-f-walker.org.uk\u002Fpubsebooks\u002Fpdfs\u002FThe_Problem_of_Serial_Order_in_Behavior.pdf\"\u003Ebetween language and action\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. \"Not only speech,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;but all skilled acts seem to involve the same problems of serial ordering, even down to the temporal coordination of muscular contractions in such a movement as reaching and grasping.\" Just as a stream of speech does not contain explicit pauses between words, fluid actions like nail hammering do not contain breaks between their components. Yet humans effortlessly parse speech streams and action sequences into their parts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is language, then, if it can describe the way we process actions as well as the way we manipulate words? Understand from this perspective, language is not a method of communication, per se, but a rather method of computation. Other animals clearly communicate with one another, sometimes in fairly elaborate ways. Whale sing, monkeys howl, birds chirp. Lizards bob their heads up and down to communicate, and some squid do it by regulating the colouration of their skin cells.
