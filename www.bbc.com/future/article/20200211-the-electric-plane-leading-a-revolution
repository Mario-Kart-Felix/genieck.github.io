British Columbia. Four minutes earlier it had taken off from the same patch of water. But despite its brief duration, the flight may have marked the start of an aviation revolution.</p>
<p>Those keen of hearing at the riverside on that cold December morning might have been able to pick up something different amid the rumble of the propellers and whoosh of water as the six-passenger de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver took off and landed. What was missing was the throaty growl of the aircraft&rsquo;s nine-cylinder radial engine.</p>

<p>For Greg McDougall, founder of Harbour Air and pilot during the test flight, it marked the culmination of years of trying to put the environment at the forefront of its operations.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote" style="border-left:3px solid #2f8735"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-header--large">It was the first shot of the electric aviation revolution – Roei Ganzarski</h2></blockquote></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>Harbour Air, which has a fleet of some 40 commuter floatplanes serving the coastal regions around Vancouver, Victoria and Seattle, was the first airline in North America to become carbon-neutral through offsets in 2007. A one-acre green roof on their new Victoria airline terminal followed. Then in 2017, 50 solar panels and four beehives housing 10,000 honeybees were added, but for McDougall, a Tesla owner with an interest in disruptive technology, the big goal was to electrify the fleet.</p>
<p>McDougall searched for alternative motor options for a couple of years and had put the plan on the backburner when Ganzarski first approached him in February 2019. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got a motor we want to get certified and we want to fly it before the end of the year,&rsquo;&rdquo; McDougall recalls.</p>
<p>The two companies found their environmental values and teams were a good match and quickly formed a partnership. Eleven months later, the modest Canadian airline got what McDougall refers to as their &ldquo;e-plane&rdquo; off the ground, pulling ahead of other electric flight projects, including those by big-name companies Airbus, Boeing and Rolls-Royce.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div><img draggable="false" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/82/zv/p082zvcv.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/82/zv/p082zvcv.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/82/zv/p082zvcv.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/82/zv/p082zvcv.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/82/zv/p082zvcv.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/82/zv/p082zvcv.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/82/zv/p082zvcv.jpg" id=""/><div class="inline-image__description"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">The test flight was followed years of work by Greg McDougall to make his airline more environmentally friendly (Credit: Diane Selkirk)</p></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>The project came together in record time considering how risk-adverse the aviation industry is, says McDougall. &ldquo;Someone had to take the lead,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The reason I live in British Columbia is because of the outdoors: protecting it is in our DNA.

<p>Currently there are about 170 electric aircraft projects underway internationally &ndash;<a href="https://www.rolandberger.com/en/Point-of-View/Electric-propulsion-is-finally-on-the-map.html">up by 50% since April 2018</a>, according to the consulting firm Roland Berger. Many of the projects are futuristic designs aimed at developing urban air taxis, private planes or aircraft for package delivery. But major firms such as Airbus have also announced plans to electrify their own aircraft. It plans to send its<a href="https://www.airbus.com/innovation/future-technology/electric-flight/e-fan-x.html"> E-Fan X hybrid prototype of a commercial passenger jet</a> on its maiden flight by 2021. But only one of the aircraft&rsquo;s four jet engines will be replaced with a 2MW electric motor, powered by a combination of an onboard battery and generator attached to a turboshaft engine, which still uses fossil fuels, inside the fuselage.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div><img draggable="false" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/83/02/p083027p.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/83/02/p083027p.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/83/02/p083027p.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/83/02/p083027p.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/83/02/p083027p.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/83/02/p083027p.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/83/02/p083027p.jpg" id=""/><div class="inline-image__description"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">Most electric aircraft to have flown to date have been small light aircraft rather than those designed to carry passengers (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>This makes Harbour Air something of an outlier. As a coastal commuter airline, it operates smaller floatplanes that tend to make short trips up and down the coastline of British Columbia and Washington State, which means its aircraft can regularly recharge their batteries. The company sees itself in a position to retrofit its entire fleet of floatplanes and make air travel in the region as green as possible.</p>
<p>This could bring some advantages. The efficiency of a typical combustion engine for a plane like this is fairly low &ndash; a large proportion of the energy from the fuel is lost as waste heat as it turns the propeller that drives the aircraft forward. Electrical motors have fewer moving parts, meaning there&rsquo;s less maintenance and less maintenance cost.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote" style="border-left:3px solid #2f8735"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-header--large">Electrical motors have fewer moving parts, meaning there’s less maintenance and less maintenance cost</h2></blockquote></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>Erika Holtz, Harbour Air&rsquo;s engineering and quality manager, sees the move to electric as the next major aviation advancement, but warns that one stumbling block has been the perception of safety. &ldquo;Mechanical systems are much better known and trusted,&rdquo; she says.

<p>But it&rsquo;s the possibility of spurring lasting change in aviation that&rsquo;s made working on the Harbour Air/magniX project so exciting for Holtz.

<p>Harbour Air hopes to get paying passengers in its eplanes in under two years. &ldquo;Canada isn't always known as an innovation centre,&rdquo; says Holtz. &ldquo;It's very regulated and aviation itself is very regulated.

<p>&ldquo;Two to 12 passenger aircraft are only a tiny fraction of global aviation emissions,&rdquo; says Lynnette Dray, senior research associate at University College London&rsquo;s Energy Institute. &ldquo;Even looking at all scheduled flights under 500 miles (which are performed by many sizes of aircraft, most of which are much bigger than two to 12 seats), less than 10% of global scheduled passenger fuel use and CO2 emissions can be substituted.&rdquo;</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote" style="border-left:3px solid #2f8735"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-header--large">There’s a lot of value in getting prototype models to market so that the technology has a chance to become familiar and trusted – Lynette Dray</h2></blockquote></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>Where Dray sees the Canadian airline having a bigger impact is with public perception. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of value in getting prototype models to market so that the technology has a chance to become familiar and trusted,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Blazing a trail for other electrical aircraft projects has been a major goal for Harbour Air and magniX. According to the The International Council on Clean Transportation, aviation contributes an estimated <a href="https://theicct.org/publications/co2-emissions-commercial-aviation-2018">2.4% of global carbon emissions</a> with 24% of global passenger transport-related CO2 being attributed to flights originating in the US. This should be a strong motivator for change, says Ganzarski.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the idea of electric aviation &ndash; getting rid of emissions and lowering operating costs &ndash; is something that the worldwide community should embrace,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The more companies get into it, the better. But we&rsquo;ll be there right in front, leading the way.&rdquo;</p>

But not for long &ndash; as I watch, a cluster of dung beetles is hard at work and soon the cows&rsquo; manure will be buried in the soil. On a warm day it can take less than an hour for the beetles to eradicate a cowpat completely from the paddock&rsquo;s surface. Other times, when the conditions are cooler and the beetles are less active, it may take up to two weeks. Either way, the insects work fastidiously until the only odour cutting through the dry summer air is the scent of eucalyptus from the giant Karri trees.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe cowpats that these particular beetles are burying are not ordinary cowpats. On this farm near Manjimup in south-west Australia, they are rich in a substance called biochar &ndash; essentially charcoal produced through a slow-bake process &ndash; that has been added to the cattle&rsquo;s feed. This black, coal-like substance is leading a quiet revolution in this pocket of rural Australia, in an effort to reduce the cows&rsquo; methane emissions and to sink more carbon into the soil.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EYou might also like:\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Ffuture\u002Farticle\u002F20200131-the-divers-trying-to-save-indias-vaan-island-from-sinking\"\u003EThe island predicted to vanish forever\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Ffuture\u002Farticle\u002F20200205-the-worst-place-in-the-world-to-be-a-cyclist\"\u003EThe city where cyclists are unwelcome\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Ffuture\u002Farticle\u002F20200131-why-and-how-does-future-planet-count-carbon\"\u003EWhy and how does Future Planet count carbon?\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBiochar is one way farmers are working to reduce the hotly debated environmental impact of cattle.

We worked with the agency Wholegrain Digital to get a bespoke carbon estimate for Future Planet stories.

As we can&rsquo;t predict exactly how many readers will click on the story before we publish it, we use a per-pageview emissions estimate, which is the same for all stories. We got this figure using a test story, calculating emissions as above and then dividing that by the pageviews that the test story actually had over six months. That gives us a better estimate than just plugging in the URL from a story to the agency&rsquo;s standard carbon calculator, because for a story where the number of pageviews is a weighty factor in the equation, using data on actual pageviews makes it more accurate.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe story we used as a test to get this figure was a BBC Future story, and we used the actual number of pageviews it had over a six-month period. Factors such as how many images a page has and the length of the story can make a big difference in the energy required to load the page, and how long the reader spends on the page.

If we do, should we count the carbon emissions from the large number of energy-hungry servers housed in the building, or is that irrelevant as they don&rsquo;t host Future Planet? Or you could take it even further: if a journalist ate a sandwich while on location reporting for us, do we count the carbon footprint of the food &ndash; or not, since they&rsquo;d likely have to eat regardless of whether they were on assignment?
