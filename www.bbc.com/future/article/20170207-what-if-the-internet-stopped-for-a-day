Before 2008, he would sometimes challenge his students to stay off the internet for 48 hours and then discuss how it affected them. But when Hancock returned to work in 2009, after a year-long sabbatical, things had changed.</p><p>&ldquo;When I tried to introduce the task, there was a class revolt,&rdquo; says Hancock, who studies the psychological and social processes involved in online communication. &ldquo;The students emphatically said the assignment was impossible and unfair.&rdquo;</p><p>They argued that going offline even for a weekend would prevent them from completing work in other classes, ruin their social lives, and make their friends and family worry that something terrible had happened to them. Hancock had to concede and cancelled the activity &ndash; and he&rsquo;s never attempted it again. &ldquo;That was 2009, and now with mobile as present as it is, I don&rsquo;t even know what students would do if I asked them to do that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d probably report me to the university president.&rdquo;</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div><img draggable="false" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/4s/74/p04s7451.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/4s/74/p04s7451.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/4s/74/p04s7451.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/4s/74/p04s7451.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/4s/74/p04s7451.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/4s/74/p04s7451.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/4s/74/p04s7451.jpg" id=""/><div class="inline-image__description"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">A 404 error pops up when a webpage cannot be found – but having no internet at all is almost unthinkable (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>But with our always-connected lifestyles, the question is now more relevant than ever: what would happen if the internet stopped for a day? It turns out the impact might not be quite what you'd expect.</p><p>In 1995, <a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/">fewer than 1% of the world&rsquo;s population was online</a>. The internet was a curiosity, used mostly by people in the West. Fast-forward 20 years and today more than 3.5bn people have an internet connection &ndash; nearly half of all humans on the planet &ndash; and the number is growing at a rate of around 10 people a second.</p><p>According to the Pew Research Centre, <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/08/one-fifth-of-americans-report-going-online-almost-constantly/">a fifth of all Americans say they use the internet &ldquo;almost constantly&rdquo;</a> and 73% say they use it at least daily. Figures in the UK are similar: a 2016 survey found that <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/itandinternetindustry/bulletins/internetusers/2016">nearly 90% of adults said they had used the internet in the previous three months</a>. For many, it is now virtually impossible to imagine life without the internet.</p><p>&ldquo;One of the biggest problems with the internet today is that people take it for granted &ndash; yet they don&rsquo;t understand the degree to which we&rsquo;ve allowed it to infiltrate almost every aspect of our lives,&rdquo; says <a href="http://cas.msu.edu/people/faculty-staff/staff-listing/name/william-dutton/">William Dutton</a> at Michigan State University, who is the author of the book Society and the Internet. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t even think about not having access to it.&rdquo;</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote inline-quote--future"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-header--large">I don&rsquo;t know what students today would do if I asked them to stay off the internet &ndash; they&rsquo;d probably report me to the university president &ndash; Jeff Hancock</h2></blockquote></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>But the internet is not inviolable. In theory, it could be taken away, on a global or national scale, for a stretch of time. Cyberattacks are one possibility. Malicious hackers could bring the internet to a standstill by releasing software that aggressively targeted vulnerabilities in routers &ndash; the devices that forward internet traffic. Shutting down domain name servers &ndash; the internet&rsquo;s address books &ndash; would also cause massive disruption, preventing websites from loading, for example.</p><p>Cutting the deep-sea cables that carry vast volumes of internet traffic between continents would also cause significant disruptions by disconnecting one part of the world from another. These cables may not be easy targets for attackers, but they are sometimes damaged accidentally. In 2008, people in the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia were plagued by major internet outages on three separate occasions when submarine cables were cut or interfered with.</p><p>Some governments also have &ldquo;kill switches&rdquo; that can effectively turn off the internet in their country. Egypt did this during the Arab Spring uprising in 2011 to make it more difficult for protesters to coordinate their activity. Turkey and Iran have also shut off internet connectivity during protests. China is rumoured to have a kill switch of its own. And American <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/internetprivacy/2011-02-15-kill-switch_N.htm">senators have proposed creating one in the US</a> as a means to defend the country from cyberattack.</p><p>Building a kill switch is not easy, however. The larger and more developed the country, the harder it is to shut down the internet completely &shy;&ndash; there are simply too many connections between networks both inside and outside national borders.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div><img draggable="false" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73y2.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73y2.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73y2.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73y2.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73y2.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73y2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73y2.jpg" id=""/><div class="inline-image__description"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">Egypt turned off its internet during the Arab Spring uprising in 2011 to make it more difficult for protesters to coordinate their activity (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>The most devastating strikes could come from space, however. A large solar storm that sent flares in our direction <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/sun_darkness.html">would take out satellites, power grids and computer systems</a>. &ldquo;What bombs and terrorism can&rsquo;t do might be accomplished in moments by a solar flare,&rdquo; says <a href="http://www.eagleman.com/">David Eagleman</a>, a neuroscientist at Stanford University and author of Why the Net Matters. &ldquo;The next major geomagnetic storms are eventually coming.&rdquo;</p><p>But most outages would not last long. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an army of people ready to put things right,&rdquo; says <a href="http://www.usccu.us/">Scott Borg</a> at the United States Cyber Consequences Unit, a non-profit organisation. &ldquo;The internet service providers and the companies that make the routing equipment have plans and personnel in place for getting things up and running again if unexpected vulnerabilities are exploited.&rdquo; We are so used to having an always-on internet connection that even relatively short disruptions would have an effect, however. It just might not be what you would expect.</p><p>For a start, the impact to the economy may not be too severe. In 2008, the US Department of Homeland Security asked Borg to look into what might happen if the internet went down. Borg and his colleagues analysed the economic effects of computer and internet outages in the US from 2000 onwards. Looking at quarterly financial reports from the 20 companies that claimed to be most affected in each case, as well as more general economic statistics, they discovered that the financial impact of an outage was surprisingly insignificant &ndash; at least for outages that lasted no more than four days, which is all they studied.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote inline-quote--future"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-header--large">If every company turned off their computers for a few hours each month and made people do the tasks they postponed, there might be an overall productivity benefit</h2></blockquote></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>&ldquo;These were instances where enormous losses were being claimed&ndash; in the hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars,&rdquo; Borg says. &ldquo;But while some industries like hotels, airlines and brokerage firms suffered a bit, even they didn&rsquo;t experience very big losses.&rdquo;</p><p>It turned out that losing internet access for a few days just made people fall behind on their work. &ldquo;People carried out all the same activities they would have done had the internet been up, but they just did it two or three days later,&rdquo; Borg says. &ldquo;The economy is set up to deal with what essentially amounts to a holiday weekend.&rdquo;</p><p>In some cases, shutting down the internet for a short time might even increase productivity. In another study, Borg and his colleagues analysed what happened when a company suffered an internet outage that lasted four hours or more. Rather than twiddle their thumbs, employees did things that they would normally put off, such as dealing with paperwork. The result was a boost for business. &ldquo;We jokingly suggested that if every company turned off their computers for a few hours each month and made people do the tasks they postponed, there&rsquo;d be an overall productivity benefit,&rdquo; Borg says. &ldquo;I see no reason why that wouldn&rsquo;t also apply to basically the whole economy.&rdquo;</p><p>Travel probably would not be affected too much in the short term, either &ndash; so long as the blackout lasted no more than a day or so. Planes can fly without the internet, and trains and buses would continue to run. Longer outages would start to have an effect on logistics, however. Without the internet it would be hard for businesses to operate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve suggested that people and businesses should have a plan in place in the event of internet loss, but I haven&rsquo;t heard of anyone doing that yet,&rdquo; Eagleman says.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div><img draggable="false" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73s8.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73s8.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73s8.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73s8.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73s8.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73s8.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/4s/73/p04s73s8.jpg" id=""/><div class="inline-image__description"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">When the phone network stops working it can make people feel isolated or uneasy (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>A large communication breakdown would probably disproportionately affect small businesses and blue-collar workers. In 1998, as many as 90% of the 50 million pagers in the US stopped working because of a satellite failure. In the days following the blackout, Dutton <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780333985465_2">surveyed</a> 250 pager users in Los Angeles and found clear socioeconomic divisions in people&rsquo;s reactions to being cut off. Upper-middle-class individuals with managerial or professional jobs did not perceive the event as largely problematic. &ldquo;To them, it felt like a snow day,&rdquo; Dutton says. &ldquo;It was a relief.&rdquo;</p><p>But many blue-collar freelancers such as plumbers and carpenters relied solely on their pagers for getting jobs and found themselves out of work for a few days. Single mothers who left their children at daycare also reported significant distress at not being able to be paged if a problem occurred. &ldquo;So you have to realise that your reaction to the idea of losing the internet is likely to be based on your socioeconomic status,&rdquo; Dutton says.</p><p>Psychological effects, like feelings of isolation and anxiety, would hit people across the board, however. &ldquo;Most of the internet is designed for one purpose: to allow us to communicate with each other,&rdquo; Hancock says. We are used to being able to connect to anyone, anywhere and at any time. &ldquo;An inability to do that would be unsettling.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a feeling Borg recognises too. &ldquo;I know when I realise I&rsquo;ve left my smartphone behind, I feel slightly naked,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I suddenly have to think, &lsquo;Do I actually know where I&rsquo;m going? What if my car breaks down, could I talk anyone into letting me use their phone to call for help?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote inline-quote--future"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-header--large">Most people using the internet are actually more social than those who are not using the internet &ndash; William Dutton</h2></blockquote></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>History supports this. In 1975, a fire at the New York Telephone Company cut off the phone service in a 300-block area of Manhattan for 23 days. In a survey of 190 people carried out immediately after lines were restored, researchers found that <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED125026">four-fifths of respondents said they missed the phone</a>, especially its ability to connect them with friends and family. Over two-thirds said the lack of service made them feel &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; or &ldquo;uneasy,&rdquo; and nearly three-quarters said they felt more in control when their service was restored.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this idea that maybe people would become more social and more in touch with friends and family if they didn&rsquo;t have use of the internet, but I think that&rsquo;s really mistaken,&rdquo; Dutton says. &ldquo;Most people using the internet are actually more social than those who are not using the internet.&rdquo;</p><p>Stine Lomborg at the University of Copenhagen agrees. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;d be more likely to speak to strangers at the bus stop if we didn&rsquo;t have our smartphones &ndash; not at all,&rdquo; she says. The loss of connection may make people more social in specific situations, such as forcing co-workers to speak to each other rather than sending emails, but overall the experience is likely to be distressing. &ldquo;The world wouldn&rsquo;t fall apart if we didn&rsquo;t have access to the internet for a day,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But for most people I think even one day without it would be terrifying.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The feeling would be fleeting, however. Losing the internet may make people recognise its importance in their lives, but we would soon be taking it for granted again, says Hancock. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to say an internet blackout would cause a shift in our thinking, but I don&rsquo;t think it would.&rdquo; Even so, that&rsquo;s still not enough to persuade his students to give it up for a weekend.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/future-now"><img src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/raw/p04jj4t7.jpg" width="100%" /></a></p><p><em>Keep up to date with Future Now stories by joining our 800,000+ fans on </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, or follow us on </em><a href="https://twitter.com/bbc_future"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts"><em>Google+</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/"><em>Instagram</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story, </em><a href="http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/"><em>sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</em></a><em>, called &ldquo;If You Only Read 6 Things This Week&rdquo;.

After a day spent text messaging, emailing and browsing the web, your smartphone is dead.

That takes currents flowing around silicon chips; and currents running round silicon chips generate heat, wasting energy. PC and laptop users are constantly reminded about this by the whirr of the fans that keep their processors cool. We don't notice it on phones, because everything they do seems to happen so silently, so effortlessly. But when you look at the detail, energy drips way like water from a leaky tap. And it all adds up.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the work of Dr Angela Nicoara, senior research scientist at the Deutsche Telekom Innovation Center in Silicon Valley. She has become something of a digital dietician, counting the joules that go into feeding our smartphones' appetites. She recently laid out her findings in \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww2012.wwwconference.org\u002Fproceedings\u002Fproceedings\u002Fp41.pdf\"\u003Ea report she enticingly called Who Killed My Battery?\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a collaboration with the group of Professor Dan Boneh at Stanford University, she connected a state of the art electronic meter to the battery of a smartphone, which typically store around 15-20,000 joules of energy, and then tracked the power for every millisecond it performed one of the most common applications for our handhelds: browsing the web.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat emerged when she broke down the actions millisecond by millisecond came as a surprise.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first was that just hitting the &ldquo;go&rdquo; button and getting the phone to contact the network used 12 joules, as the phone exchanged details with the local base station, agreed transmission settings and so on. That&rsquo;s before a single byte was downloaded. When that process begins, the real surprises come thick and fast.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out that the design of the web page has a massive impact on the energy it takes to put it on your mobile screen. For example, the BBC News website, specifically designed for mobile users, took another 3 joules to download and process all the bits for a news story. For the worst performer of the websites she explored, Apple.com, it took another 34 joules &ndash; 11 times more than the BBC. Wikipedia came just behind.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareless websites, she found, are at least contributors to killing her battery. For our PCs and laptops connected to the mains, these numbers don&rsquo;t matter. With the constraints of a mobile battery they are critical.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference between these websites was in the way that they were built. For example, interactive elements that are used to customise a site experience and often run in the background of a site were a big drain. A half of those 34 joules needed to see the Apple page were down to &nbsp;these functions, without them even being touched; on Wikipedia, they alone cost 10 joules.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother drain are the so-called CSS files that tell a browser how to layout the page. Again, on the Apple site, these required 12 joules to download and render onto the screen. Simple improvements reduce this by 5 joules.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach joule might seem a trivial amount, but like a slimmer on a diet lots of small savings soon add up &ndash; especially when some websites take eleven times as much energy to visit as others.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EElectronic warfare\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut website design is not the only drain on a phone&rsquo;s batteries. The way we access these websites &ndash; and in particular the settings our service providers use - also has a huge effect, according to Hari Balakrishnan, Fujitsu Professor of Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurprisingly, it is the network that decides what power setting our handsets use. When we need to transmit, the network tells our handsets to power up to maximum.&nbsp; But the network&rsquo;s interests are different from ours. We would like to power down again as soon possible to save our battery.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut only a slender portion of an already crowded radio spectrum is assigned for these so-called control messages, says Dr Balakrishnan. Because of that, the network tries to minimise the number of control signals it sends, even if that leaves our handset powering away while doing nothing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;&ldquo;A classic example,&rdquo; says Dr Balakrishnan, &ldquo;is when you&rsquo;re running an application that wakes up every 20 or 30 seconds and sends one byte of information. That would, in many cases, keep your radio in the high-power, active mode all the time. But it doesn&rsquo;t have to. That kind of trivial workload should consume next to no energy, but ends up using huge amounts of energy because of the sub-optimal controls implemented by the networks.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike Dr Nicoara, Dr Balakrishnan decided to test his suspicion by wiring his battery to a meter and watching the battery drain. The results showed that by letting the phone control its own settings, he could halve the power consumed by the wireless transmissions with minimal effect on the network performance (although he stresses the details change from device to device, and from network to network).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, these might seem small improvements overall &ndash; but a network that can give our phones a few more hours of working battery life is highly likely to attract more customers these days.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it wouldn't matter how long your phone was fired up to exchange bits with the base station, if it could do so with minimal energy. But it turns out the mobile industry has been fighting a war with its electronics for years because they are so inefficient.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, it is the purity of the radio wave that they use to connect to the base station that requires so much power.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith radio spectrum restricted (see the \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Ffuture\u002Fstory\u002F20130221-smart-networks-for-smartphones\"\u003Etwo previous\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Ffuture\u002Fstory\u002F20130212-mobiles-signal-dawning-crisis\"\u003Earticles\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in this series) transmission frequencies are squeezed in close together, and any distortion in the signal would lead to catastrophic interference. And it turns out that the basic physics of the amplifiers that drive the antennae can only generate those pure waves when drawing a lot of electrical current.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the 3G standards were introduced, manufacturers turned to a special design of amplifier first concocted back in the 1930s, because of the stringent demands of the networks. But even then, for every watt of transmitted radio power, there's more than another watt simply warming your handset to create this pure wave. Basically, simple physics is doubling the drain rate on your battery.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;The industry is racing furiously to mitigate this problem,&rdquo; says Joel Dawson, Professor of Power Engineering at MIT, who has himself come forward with a smart fix that involves electronically compensating for this distortion, something that could apparently halve the losses. But how soon any of those fixes will make it to the market remains to be seen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnergy harvest\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course these aren&rsquo;t the only drains on a battery. Modern smartphones pack everything from small accelerometers to energy hungry global positioning systems. And then there is the display - the whole selling point of the smart phone is the interface that lets you access the world wherever you are. Until researchers can develop electronic-inks similar to these used in the Kindle e-book or other pixelated passive systems that refresh as fast as lit screens, simply viewing the phone comes at a substantial cost.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe obvious solution would be to pack in a bigger battery, but of all the components in your handset, the battery is the one that represents seriously mature technology. Most of the electrochemistry was laid down a hundred years ago and, as one battery manufacturer confessed to me, there's little they can do about. The introduction of the rechargeable lithium-ion battery in the 1990s was something of a step change. But since then &hellip; well, while virtually every other phone parameter doubles in a year or two, it takes a decade to double battery performance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are ongoing efforts to improve battery technology (See: \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Ffuture\u002Fstory\u002F20120227-charging-tomorrows-smartphones\"\u003ECharging Tomorrow&rsquo;s smartphones\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) but there may also be another route: harvesting energy from the environment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar power is long-established, and has been tried many times with mobile phones, but has failed largely because of inconvenience. As the front of phones is crowded out with buttons, photovoltaic cells have largely been put on the back &ndash; but that has required turning a phone upside down to keep the battery charged.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the form of the modern smart phone, freeing up the top face, has changed all that. And one potential solution is on display at this week&rsquo;s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWYSIPS (&ldquo;What You See is the Photovoltaic Surface&rdquo;), as it is known, is a joke, according to Francis Robcis, sales director for the new product. &ldquo;Because you can&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; he explains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it needs to be like that, because WYSIPS has silicon solar cells embedded within the large smartphone display.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;Go into the office, and most people will leave their phones lying around with the face up,&rdquo; says Robcis. So that when the set is idle, the tiny silicon strips (too small to see) are busy recharging the battery.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge has been to integrate the photovoltaics into the display without dimming the image by more than 10 per cent &ndash; a reduction users should find acceptable. And to allow it to sit alongside the touchscreen function. If the system takes off, the future mobile screen could become a busy place.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe company hopes to have a pilot line producing screens by the end of the year, to prove the technology is viable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowering by sunlight, of course, is conventional, even if unfamiliar in mobile phones. At the University of Washington Seattle, ex-Intel researcher Joshua Smith is planning something much more radical: powering mobile phones - with gratifying circularity - by radio waves.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis lab, funded by tech giants Intel and Google, has already made great strides. &ldquo;The largest TV towers in the US put out around a megawatt of energy,&rdquo; Smith explains. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re able to operate our energy harvester as much as 30 km from one and get small but usable amounts of energy.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn essence, harvesting radio energy requires rewiring the phone antenna to extract not the signal but the power of the carrier wave. And it&rsquo;s not only powerful TV transmissions that you can tap into. Recently, Smith&rsquo;s lab has been able to harvest energy from mobile phone masts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe quantities available are down in the microwatt range, so not enough to power voice transmissions. But enough energy can be accumulated, Smith says, to send short texts, or just to stretch the battery life.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;It would be enough to have perpetual standby. My favourite example is driving along in my car. My son is playing Angry Birds on the cell phone, and completely drains the battery. And then I get a flat tyre. It would be nice if I could send an emergency SMS using this ambient energy. And of course, compared to solar power, you could even do it at night.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of which means that the daily ritual of recharging your phone could soon be a thing of the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIf you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002FBBCFuture\"\u003EFacebook page\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cem\u003E or message us on \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002F#%21\u002FBBC_Future\"\u003ETwitter\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20130227-what-is-killing-smartphones-0"}],"collection":[],"disableAdverts":false,"displayDate":"2014-11-18T09:16:36Z","embeddedCustomHtml":"","embeddedInfographicUrl":"","embeddedType":"","geolocation":null,"headlineLong":"What is killing smartphones?","headlineShort":"What is killing smartphones?","image":[],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageAltText":"","isSyndicated":false,"latitude":"","location":null,"longitude":"","mpsVideo":"","option":null,"partner":null,"primaryVertical":"future","promoAlignment":"centre","promoAltText":"","promoImage":[],"relatedStories":[],"relatedTag":null,"summaryLong":"What drains a smartphone battery so quickly... and what can be done about it?","summaryShort":"And what is being done about it?","tag":[],"creationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:36Z","entity":"article","guid":"d2d6f5b9-7af1-4deb-8602-db188bd4d257","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20130227-what-is-killing-smartphones","modifiedDateTime":"2019-10-04T14:35:10.266973Z","project":"future","slug":"20130227-what-is-killing-smartphones","cacheLastUpdated":1587442999741},"future\u002Farticle\u002F20161027-how-smart-homes-have-become-the-haunted-houses-of-today":{"urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:article:future\u002Farticle\u002F20161027-how-smart-homes-have-become-the-haunted-houses-of-today","_id":"5e982097272a584021aaf7e0","ambientVideo":"","articleType":"story","assetVideo":null,"author":[],"bodyIntro":"Our close relationship with technology has made it easy for our devices to creep us out","businessUnit":"worldwide","cards":[{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"calloutBodyHtml":"\u003Cp\u003EThis article was inspired by a \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.co.uk\u002Fprogrammes\u002Fb080t0p9\"\u003EBBC Radio 4 episode of Digital Human\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which is available as a podcast from Monday 31 October.

Courtesy of the internet, the furore around ogooglebar is likely only to spread its usage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are larger concerns at stake here, however. I&rsquo;ve spent much of the last year writing \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ftomchatfield.net\u002F\"\u003Ea book about language and technology\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, and the rise of &ldquo;ungooglable&rdquo; and its international equivalents marks one of the most characteristic linguistic evolutions of our age: binary vocabulary.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUnfollow, unfriend\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo take just a handful of terms, consider what it means to &ldquo;like&rdquo; and to &ldquo;unlike&rdquo;, or to &ldquo;favourite&rdquo; and to &ldquo;unfavourite&rdquo;; how you can &ldquo;follow&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfollow&rdquo;, or &ldquo;friend&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfriend&rdquo;, other people; and how you constantly &ldquo;click&rdquo; or &ldquo;unclick&rdquo; onscreen boxes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn each case, what&rsquo;s on offer is a near-miraculous promise of agency: the possibility of words and actions that are, unlike those taking place in the real world, entirely reversible. There&rsquo;s nothing that cannot be undone in an instant, then done again at will (the word &ldquo;undone&rdquo; itself has existed in English for around 700 years but, when Shakespeare and his predecessors used it, they usually implied death or destruction: a far cry from pressing &ldquo;Ctrl-Z&rdquo; on a keyboard).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven &ldquo;ungoogleable&rdquo; has a reassuring kind of certainty to it. On the one hand lies the ordered, searchable realm within which we conduct our daily digital business. On the other, there&rsquo;s the stuff we&rsquo;re best off not worrying about: a \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.co.uk\u002Fnews\u002Fmagazine-21956743\"\u003Emessy, unsearachable space\u003C\u002Fa\u003E spanning everything from cyber-dissidents to criminals, via paywalls and anonymous networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept, of course, the boxes of online experience are never quite as tidy as they seem. &ldquo;Untag&rdquo; yourself from an embarrassing public image &ndash; or indeed from an image that doesn&rsquo;t actually show you at all &ndash; and both the deed and the undeed will remain recorded forever. Unfollow or unfriend someone you know and they will vanish from view &ndash; but they may well never forget or forgive. No matter how many times you click undo, the machine records and remembers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReversible words promise a kind of perpetual present, in which everything can always be exactly the way you want it (provided you only feel one of two ways). Yet data itself only accumulates. Whether you consider yourself to be ogooglebar or not, the digital book of your life is steadily being written within somebody&rsquo;s servers &ndash; and few of its words will ever be unwritten.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E&lsquo;Ugly gloop&rsquo;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of which makes the ownership of words an important battleground. In Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s Alice Through The Looking Glass, Humpty Dumpty explains to Alice that &ldquo;When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean &ndash; neither more nor less.&rdquo; Carroll was using absurdity to make a simple point: language is something we build together, and I can no more choose the precise meaning of my words than I can decide which laws of physics apply to me. Google, however, seem determined to play Humpty Dumpty &ndash; and in the process to make a very particular kind of binary claim. Either you use &ldquo;Google&rdquo; their way, or you don&rsquo;t get to use it all.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommercial imperatives may be at stake, not least around the vexed question of trademarks, but there&rsquo;s also an old-fashioned petulance to this insistence: as if official approval still governed the way we judge language. Given that most of us are likely simply to type a word into Google if we want to check its meaning, this puts the company in a curiously invidious position. Should it describe words as people are using them, or suggest in certain cases how things &ldquo;ought&rdquo; to be?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccurately reflecting the world has always been a sacrosanct principle for search. When it comes to language, though, every act of selection and interconnection itself adds another layer of meaning (just start typing into a search box to find out what auto-completed ideas are associated with your name). &nbsp;If you can&rsquo;t find something online, it&rsquo;s often because you lack the right words. And there&rsquo;s a deliciously circular logic to all this, whereby what&rsquo;s &ldquo;right&rdquo; means only what displays the best search results &ndash; just as what you yourself &ldquo;like&rdquo; is defined by the boxes you&rsquo;ve ticked.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, then, the Swedish Language Council&rsquo;s statement of language&rsquo;s independence from influence may not be quite as convincing as it seems. While no individual can decide the future of language, does the same apply to the software through which so many millions of our words flow each day?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;Ungooglable&rdquo; is an ugly gloop of a word (ogooglebar is much more mellifluous), but it&rsquo;s also a tribute to a certain species of contemporary power &ndash; and the ways in which some tools can shape not only how we communicate, but what we say, what we&rsquo;re not allowed to say, and what the world thinks we mean. Language online may seem a simple, binary business. But there&rsquo;s always more to be said at the margins of words.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDo you agree with Tom?

City populations are indicated in yellow patches, and rather than cram in as many towns as possible, Imus uses census data to standardise rural places in terms of what counts as a hub in that particular area &ndash; whether that means 500 or 5,000 people. Major landmarks and transportation centres like airports are marked; Native American reserves are included (something lacking on many maps); and elevation of not only of mountains but also cities is noted. &ldquo;The National Geographic map of the US has some elevations of mountain peaks but doesn&rsquo;t even tell you the elevation of Denver, Colorado,&rdquo; Imus says. &ldquo;As a consequence, it doesn&rsquo;t communicate anything meaningful about what that place is like if you&rsquo;ve never been there.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHigh standard\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch maps are incredibly time consuming and expensive to produce, however.

Some cities in Asia and Africa, Gupta says, are undergoing so much construction that Google Maps have been unable to keep up. At the same time, natural landscapes are constantly in a state of flux &ndash; now, more so than ever. Islands are being devoured by the sea, ice floes are disappearing, shorelines are eroding and forests are being cleared. &ldquo;The very moment you build a perfect map of the world is the moment it goes out of date,&rdquo; Gupta says. &ldquo;The real world will always be a little bit ahead of how we represent it, because change is constant.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that sense, the entire world is undermapped, and it will always remain that way.

Take, for example, the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. By the end of the 100BC the Romans had spread across the Mediterranean, to the places most easily accessed by sea. They should have stopped there, but things were going well and they felt empowered to expand to new frontiers by land. While transportation by sea was economical, however, transportation across land was slow and expensive. All the while, they were overextending themselves and running up costs. The Empire managed to remain stable in the ensuing centuries, but repercussions for spreading themselves too thin caught up with them in the 3rd Century, which was plagued by civil war and invasions. The Empire tried to maintain its core lands, even as the army ate up its budget and inflation climbed ever higher as the government debased its silver currency to try to cover its mounting expenses. While some scholars cite the beginning of collapse as the year 410, when the invading Visigoths sacked the capital, that dramatic event was made possible by a downward spiral spanning more than a century.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20170418-how-western-civilisation-could-collapse-10"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"PullQuote","iFrameType":"","pullQuote":"Eventually, Rome could no longer afford to prop up its heightened complexities &nbsp;","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20170418-how-western-civilisation-could-collapse-11"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Joseph Tainter, a professor of environment and society at Utah State University and author of \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FCollapse-Complex-Societies-Studies-Archaeology\u002Fdp\u002F052138673X\"\u003EThe Collapse of Complex Societies\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, one of the most important lessons from Rome&rsquo;s fall is that \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com\u002Fdoi\u002F10.1002\u002Fsres.1057\u002Fabstract\"\u003Ecomplexity\u003C\u002Fa\u003E has a cost.

Tainter suspects this will not always be the case, however. &ldquo;Imagine the costs if we have to build a seawall around Manhattan, just to protect against storms and rising tides,&rdquo; he says. Eventually, investment in complexity as a problem-solving strategy reaches a point of diminishing returns, leading to fiscal weakness and vulnerability to collapse.

Western societies will respond with restrictions and even bans on immigration; multi-billion dollar walls and border-patrolling drones and troops; heightened security on who and what gets in; and more authoritarian, populist styles of governing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost an immunological attempt by countries to sustain a periphery and push pressure back,&rdquo; Homer-Dixon says.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, a widening gap between rich and poor within those already vulnerable Western nations will push society toward further instability from the inside. &ldquo;By 2050, the US and UK will have evolved into two-class societies where a small elite lives a good life and there is declining well-being for the majority,&rdquo; Randers says. &ldquo;What will collapse is equity.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether in the US, UK or elsewhere, the more dissatisfied and afraid people become, Homer-Dixon says, the more of a tendency they have to cling to their in-group identity &ndash; whether religious, racial or national.

If people admit that problems exist at all, they will assign blame for those problems to everyone outside of their in-group, building up resentment. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re setting up the psychological and social prerequisites for mass violence,&rdquo; Homer-Dixon says.
