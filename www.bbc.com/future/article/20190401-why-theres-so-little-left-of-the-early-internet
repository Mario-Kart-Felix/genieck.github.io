So he scribbled on a pad: &ldquo;How to become a millionaire.&rdquo;</p><p>Twenty minutes later he had what he thought was the answer.</p><p>Tew set up a website called the <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">Million Dollar Homepage</a>. The site&rsquo;s model was almost obscenely simple: on it was a million pixels of ad space, the pixels available to buy in blocks of 100 at $1 a pixel. Once you bought them they were yours forever. When the millionth pixel was sold, Tew would be a millionaire. At least, that was the plan.</p><p>The Million Dollar Homepage launched on 26 August 2005, after Tew had spent the grand sum of 50 euros on registering the domain and setting up the hosting. Advertisers bought pixels and provided a link, tiny image and a short amount of text for when the cursor hovered over their image.</p><p><em>You might also like:</em></p><ul> <li><strong><a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180914-the-it-behemoth-that-you-might-have-never-heard-of">Yandex: The rise of &lsquo;Russia&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171019-could-estonia-be-the-first-digital-country">Could Estonia be the first digital country?</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180110-the-invented-language-that-found-a-second-life-online">The invented language that thrives online</a></strong></li> </ul><p>After little more than a month, thanks to word-of-mouth and ever-increasing media attention, Tew&rsquo;s homepage had raised more than $250,000 (&pound;140,000). In January 2006, the last 1,000 pixels were sold at auction for $38,100 (&pound;21,500); Tew had indeed made his million.</p><p>The Million Dollar Homepage is still online, nearly a decade and a half after it was created. Many of the customers &ndash; which included the likes of the UK&rsquo;s The Times newspaper, travel service Cheapflights.com, online portal Yahoo! and rock duo Tenacious D &ndash; have had 15 years of advertising off that one-off payment. The site still has several thousand viewers every day; it has probably been a very good investment.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div><img draggable="false" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/75/60/p07560dv.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/75/60/p07560dv.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/75/60/p07560dv.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/75/60/p07560dv.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/75/60/p07560dv.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/75/60/p07560dv.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/75/60/p07560dv.jpg" id=""/><div class="inline-image__description"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">The Million Dollar Homepage is now full of links to sites which no longer exist (Credit: Million Dollar Homepage)</p></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>Tew, who now runs the meditation and mindfulness app Calm, indeed became a millionaire. But the homepage he created has also become something else: a living museum to an earlier internet era. Fifteen years may not seem a long time, but in terms of the internet it is like a geological age. Some 40% of the links on the Million Pixel Homepage now link to dead sites. Many of the others now point to entirely new domains, their original URL sold to new owners.</p><p>The Million Dollar Homepage shows that the decay of this early period of the internet is almost invisible. In the offline world, the closing of, say, a local newspaper is often widely reported. But online sites die, often without fanfare, and the first inkling you may have that they are no longer there is when you click on a link to be met with a blank page.</p><p>***</p><p>Around a decade ago, I spent two years working on a rock music blog and on the music section of AOL, the sprawling internet pioneer now owned by US phone company Verizon. I edited or wrote hundreds of live reviews, music news stories, artists interviews and listicles. Facebook and Twitter were already massive audience drivers, and smartphones were connecting us to the Web between work and home; surfing the Web had become a round-the-clock activity.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote inline-quote--future"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-header--large">If Brewster Kahle hadn&rsquo;t set up the Internet Archive and started saving things, without waiting for anyone&rsquo;s permission, we&rsquo;d have lost everything &ndash; Dame Wendy Hall</h2></blockquote></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>You could, quite reasonably, assume that if I ever needed to show proof of my time there it would only be a Google search away.

But the arrival of the internet &ndash; and how quickly it became a mass form of communication and expression &ndash; may have taken them by surprise. The attempts to archive the internet have, in many areas, been playing catch-up ever since. &ldquo;The British Library had to have a copy of every local newspaper published,&rdquo; she says. As the newspapers have gone from print to the Web, the archiving takes a different form. Are these websites as vital a resource as the papers which preceded them?</p><p>Newspaper archives are vulnerable, too, to being lost when the publications are closed down or merged with other titles. &ldquo;Most newspapers, I imagine, will have some sort or archive,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But that can be lost unless it is archived properly.&rdquo;</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote inline-quote--future"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-header--large">Who&rsquo;s going to pay for it?

Every minute &ndash; every second &ndash; more photos, blog posts, videos, news stories and comments are added to the pile. While digital storage has fallen drastically in price, archiving all this material still costs money. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to pay for it?&rdquo; asks Dame Wendy. &ldquo;We produce so much more material than we used to.&rdquo;</p><p>In the UK, the role of digital conservation has partly fallen to the British Library. The library runs the UK Web Archive, which has been collecting websites by permission since 2004. The archive&rsquo;s engagement manager Jason Webber says the problem is much bigger than most people realise.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div><img draggable="false" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/75/5w/p0755w9r.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/75/5w/p0755w9r.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/75/5w/p0755w9r.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/75/5w/p0755w9r.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/75/5w/p0755w9r.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/75/5w/p0755w9r.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/75/5w/p0755w9r.jpg" id=""/><div class="inline-image__description"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">Very little of the content from the earliest days of the Web - the era of messageboards and internet cafes - now remains (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only the early material.

There&rsquo;s nothing from that era that was ever copied from the live web.&rdquo; Even the first web page set up in 1991 no longer exists; the page you can view on the World Wide Web Consortium is a copy made a year later.</p><p>For much of the first five years of the Web, much of the material published in Britain ended with the designation .ac.uk &ndash; academic articles written by academics. It was only in 1996 that the Web started seeing more general sites being set up, as commercial websites started outnumbering academic ones.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote inline-quote--future"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-header--large">I think there&rsquo;s been very low level of awareness that anything is missing &ndash; Jason Webber</h2></blockquote></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>The British Library does one &ldquo;domain crawl&rdquo; every year &ndash; saving anything that is published in the UK. &ldquo;We try and get everything, but we do only do it once a year. But the cap for a lot of these sites is set at 500MB; that covers a lot of smaller sites, but you only have to have a few videos in there and that limit gets reached pretty quickly.&rdquo; News websites like BBC News, however, do get crawled more often. The library, Webber says, has tried to build as complete picture as possible of events such as Brexit, the London 2012 Olympics and the 100th anniversary of World War One.</p><p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s been very low level of awareness that anything is missing,&rdquo; Webber says. &ldquo;The digital world is very ephemeral, we look at our phones, the stuff on it changes and we don&rsquo;t really think about it. But now people are becoming more aware of how much we might be losing.&rdquo;</p><p>But, Webber says, the only material organisations have the right to gather is publicly viewable; an even bigger amount of culturally or historically important data is sitting on people&rsquo;s archives, like their hard drives. But few of us are keeping those for posterity.</p><p>&ldquo;The British Library is full of letters between people. There are exchanges between politicians, or love letters, and these things are really important to some people.&rdquo;</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div><img draggable="false" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/75/5t/p0755tq3.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/75/5t/p0755tq3.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/75/5t/p0755tq3.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/75/5t/p0755tq3.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/75/5t/p0755tq3.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/75/5t/p0755tq3.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/75/5t/p0755tq3.jpg" id=""/><div class="inline-image__description"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">Archives knew the importance of saving newspapers but were slower to react to the rise in online material (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>We consider the material we post onto social networks as something that will always be there, just a click of a keyboard away.

If you have any doubt about the temporary nature of the Web, take a few minutes to trawl through the Million Dollar Homepage. It is the testament to how quickly our online past is fading away.</p><p>There is another side to data loss. Dame Wendy points out that not archiving stories from news websites could lead to a selective view of history &ndash; new governments choosing not to save stories or archives which have cast them in a poor light, for instance.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote inline-quote--future"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-header--large">The political is so often tied into the technical &ndash; Jane Winters</h2></blockquote></div><div><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>&ldquo;As soon as there&rsquo;s a change of government, or restructuring of quangos, sites are closed down,&rdquo; says Jane Winters, a professor of digital humanities at the University of London. &ldquo;Or look at election campaigning sites, which by their nature are set up to be temporary.&rdquo;</p><p>Sometimes the sites that are lost echo even more seismic changes; the deaths and births of nations themselves. &ldquo;It happened with Yugoslavia; .yu was the top-level domain for Yugoslavia, and that ended when it collapsed. There&rsquo;s a researcher who is trying to rebuild what was there before the break-up,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>&ldquo;The political is so often tied into the technical.&rdquo;</p><p>There is, perhaps, a slight silver lining. &ldquo;I come from a history background, and we&rsquo;ve always had to deal with gaps in the historical records, some of which we know about, and some we just have no idea about.&rdquo;</p><p>Dame Wendy Hall also sees parallels with the physical. When she was 15, in the late 1960s, she appeared as part of the audience in a taping of the BBC&rsquo;s music show Top of the Pops.</p><p>The show was shown on Christmas Day. &ldquo;The TV was on, and my mother said &lsquo;There you are!

But CLT just looks like ordinary 3m (10ft) planks of wood, one inch thick, replete with knot-holes and splinters. The ingenuity is that the planks are made stronger by gluing them in layers of three, with each layer perpendicular to the other. This means that the CLT &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t bow or bend, it has integral strength in two directions&rdquo;, says Waugh. &ldquo;[A CLT] wall supports the floor above, with a horizontal strength to carry a load above it, acting like a long beam&rdquo;.

CLT had only ever been used for &ldquo;nice and simple two-storey houses&rdquo;, whereas anything taller reverted to concrete and steel.

We have sex because it fulfills biological drives, including the necessary drives to procreate and bond. In fact, these are the two \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C\u002Fem\u003Es that have passed down to us in the Western tradition, both of which are organised around a telos, or end goal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I wrote in a \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Ffuture\u002Fstory\u002F20170315-the-invention-of-heterosexuality\"\u003Eprevious article\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, it was the stoics who, attempting to curb self-indulgence, tried to fit sex into a scheme of meaning: indulging in the pleasure of sex was alright as long as it was \u003Cem\u003Efor\u003C\u002Fem\u003E the purposes of making babies. This ethic worked its way into the Christian tradition, famously through Augustine, and continues to wield enormous influence in the West. According to this framework, sex is ethical when it is practised primarily for procreation. (To clarify, though this is presented as a Christian ethic, its origins lie elsewhere. In fact, the biblical book Song of Solomon celebrates wild, passionate, erotic sex on its own terms, between two lovers &ndash; not between a husband and wife, as later Christian commentators wrongly interpreted the poem.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other important \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C\u002Fem\u003E for sex comes from Aristotle, as Halperin points out. In Prior Analytics from the 4th Century BCE, the Greek philosopher offers the following syllogism:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;To be loved, then, is preferable to intercourse, according to the nature of erotic desire. Erotic desire, then, is more a desire for love than for intercourse. If it is most of all for that, that is also its end. Either intercourse, then, is not an end at all or it is for the sake of being loved.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Aristotle, as Halperin explains, &ldquo;Love is the telos of erotic desire. It is not love that aims at sex as its goal&hellip; It is sex that aims at love.&rdquo; The real reason we have sex, according to Aristotle&rsquo;s proof, is not because we want to have sex, but because we want to love and be loved. Sex is not about something, but about something else, something \u003Cem\u003Ehigher\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, something \u003Cem\u003Enobler\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike many people, Aristotle takes it for granted that sex and love go hand in hand &ndash; but he never seeks to demonstrate the soundness of this assumption. What he \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C\u002Fem\u003E demonstrate, however, at least as Halperin reads him, is that &ldquo;sex is not the final aim of erotic desire&rdquo;. And if that&rsquo;s the case, then Halperin thinks the most interesting question to ask isn&rsquo;t about the relationship between sex and love but the surprising relationship between sex and erotic desire. If Aristotle is correct, then sex has no erotic purpose &ndash; its real aim lies elsewhere.

In 1885, when the spike was first investigated, the renowned French scientist Paul Broca complained that it even had a name at all. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t like it because he had studied so many specimens, and he hadn&rsquo;t really seen any which had it.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeeling that something might be up, Shahar decided to investigate.

And should we be concerned?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShahar thinks the spike explosion is down to modern technology, particularly our recent obsession with smartphones and tablets. As we hunch over them, we crane our necks and hold our heads forward. This is problematic, because the average head weighs around 10 pounds (4.5 kg) &ndash; about as much as a large watermelon.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EText neck\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we&rsquo;re sitting upright, these hefty objects are balanced neatly on top of our spines.

Shahar thinks the spikes form because the hunched posture creates extra pressure on the place where the neck muscles attach to the skull &ndash; and the body responds by laying down fresh layers of bone. These help the skull to cope with the extra stress, by spreading the weight over a wider area.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, bad posture was not invented in the 21st Century &ndash; people have always found something to hunch over. So why didn&rsquo;t we get the skull protuberances from books? One possibility is down to the sheer amount of time that we currently spend on our phones, versus how long a person would previously have spent reading.

Before his study, the most recent research was conducted at an osteological lab in India, in 2012. That&rsquo;s a lab specialising entirely in bones &ndash; as you can imagine, they have quite a lot of skulls &ndash; but the doctor there only found one with the growth. It measured 8 mm, which is so small, it wouldn&rsquo;t even have been included in Shahar&rsquo;s results. &ldquo;And he thought it was significant enough to write a whole paper about it!&rdquo; he says. In his own study, the most substantial growths were 30mm long.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntriguingly, the strong men from the Mariana islands also tend to have \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapps.dtic.mil\u002Fdtic\u002Ftr\u002Ffulltext\u002Fu2\u002Fa574251.pdf\"\u003Egrowths on their skulls\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

They will continue to get bigger and bigger &ndash; &ldquo;Imagine if you have stalactites and stalagmites, if no one is bothering them, they will just keep growing&rdquo; &ndash; but it&rsquo;s rare for them to cause any trouble by themselves.

But there was one part where this wasn&rsquo;t the case: the jaw.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt soon became clear that instead of being determined by genetics, the shape of the jaw was mostly affected by whether that person had grown up in a hunter-gatherer society, or a community that relied on farming. Cramon-Taubadel thinks it&rsquo;s all down to how much chewing we do as we&rsquo;re growing up. &ldquo;If you think about orthodontics, obviously the reason we do that with teenagers is because their bones are still growing,&rdquo; says Cramon-Taubadel. &ldquo;Bones are still malleable at that age and they will respond to different pressures.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn modern, farming-based societies where the food is soft and palatable, we can wolf down a meal without needing to mash it up much first. Less chewing makes for weaker muscles, which means our jaws don&rsquo;t develop as robustly. Another idea is that it&rsquo;s down to breastfeeding, because the age at which mothers wean their children varies widely, and dictates when they begin chewing more solid food.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20190610-how-modern-life-is-transforming-the-human-skeleton-10"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"PullQuote","iFrameType":"","pullQuote":"In post-industrial populations, we&rsquo;re much more likely to suffer from dental problems &ndash; such as dental crowding and crooked teeth","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20190610-how-modern-life-is-transforming-the-human-skeleton-11"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EBut there&rsquo;s no need to mourn your weak farmer&rsquo;s jawline just yet.

And it became very popular, I think, because it&rsquo;s a way of distancing yourself from strife and keeping your centre of gravity within you.&rdquo; He emphasises that this is not an excuse to remain passive or apathetic &ndash; it simply helps you to find some personal peace in the turmoil, and some perspective in the battles we do choose to fight, rather than resorting to outrage in every disagreement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more detached approach might also help us to deal with the trials of social media and to remember that the truth of someone&rsquo;s private life is often very different from the perfect exterior we present to the world. &ldquo;It must be very difficult growing up, when that [social media] is really all you know, and you&rsquo;re comparing that to this sort of horrible, ugly, messy version of yourself that you know, exists,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to remember that everybody else has one of those as well.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that in mind, I wonder how much we are simply seeing a public facade of Brown himself.
