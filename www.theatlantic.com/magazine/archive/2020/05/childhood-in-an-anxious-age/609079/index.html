But to recap: After remaining more or less flat in the 1970s and ’80s, rates of adolescent depression declined slightly from the early ’90s through the mid-aughts. Shortly thereafter, though, they started climbing, and they haven’t stopped. Many studies, drawing on multiple data sources, confirm this; one of the more recent analyses, by Pew, shows that from 2007 to 2017, the percentage of 12-to-17-year-olds who had experienced a major depressive episode in the previous year <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/12/a-growing-number-of-american-teenagers-particularly-girls-are-facing-depression/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'609079'">shot up from 8 percent to 13 percent</a>—meaning that, in the span of a decade, the number of severely depressed teenagers went from 2 million to 3.2 million. Among girls, the rate was even higher; in 2017, one in five reported experiencing major depression.</p><p>An even more wrenching manifestation of this trend can be seen in the suicide numbers. From 2007 to 2017, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db352-h.pdf" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'609079'">suicides among 10-to-24-year-olds rose 56 percent</a>, overtaking homicide as the second leading cause of death in this age group (after accidents). The increase among preadolescents and younger teens is particularly startling. Suicides by children ages 5 to 11 have almost doubled in recent years. Children’s <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2730063" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'609079'">emergency-room visits for suicide attempts or suicidal ideation rose</a> from 580,000 in 2007 to 1.1 million in 2015; 43 percent of those visits were by children younger than 11. Trying to understand why the sort of emotional distress that once started in adolescence now seems to be leaching into younger age groups, I called Laura Prager, a child psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a co-author of <a href="https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(13)00381-X/abstract" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'609079'"><i>Suicide by Security Blanket, and Other Stories From the Child Psychiatry Emergency Service</i></a>.

The opioid epidemic also appears to be playing a role: One study suggests that <a href="https://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/now-jama-psychiatry-twin-epidemics-increasing-parental-use-opioids-and-rate-youth-suicide" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'609079'">a sixth of the increase in teen suicides can be linked to parental opioid addiction</a>.

Nor can they account for the fragility that now seems to accompany so many kids out of adolescence and into their young-adult years. The closest thing to a unified theory of the case—<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'609079'">one put forth in <i>The Atlantic </i>three years ago by the psychologist Jean M.

But none of this suggests much in the way of solutions. Taking phones away from miserable kids seems like a bad idea; as long as that’s where much of teenagers’ social lives are transacted, you’ll only isolate them.

As a symptom of deteriorating mental health, experts say, “school refusal” is the equivalent of a four-alarm fire, both because it signals profound distress and because it can lead to so-called failure to launch—seen in the rising share of young adults who don’t work or attend school and who are dependent on their parents.</p><p>Lynn Lyons, a therapist and co-author of <i>Anxious Kids, Anxious Parents</i>, told me that the childhood mental-health crisis risks becoming self-perpetuating: “The worse that the numbers get about our kids’ mental health—the more anxiety, depression, and suicide increase—the more fearful parents become.

As a result, we now know that anxiety disorders are by far the most common psychiatric condition in children, and are far more common than we thought 20 or 30 years ago. We know they affect nearly a third of adolescents ages 13 to 18, and that <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/208678" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'25',r'609079'">their median age of onset is 11</a>, although some anxiety disorders start much earlier (the median age for a phobia to start is 7).</p><p>Many cases of childhood anxiety go away on their own—and if you don’t have an anxiety disorder in childhood, you’re unlikely to develop one as an adult. Less happily, the cases that don’t resolve tend to get more severe and to lead to further problems—<a href="https://adaa.org/living-with-anxiety/children/childhood-anxiety-disorders" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'26',r'609079'">first additional anxiety disorders</a>, then mood and substance-abuse disorders. “Age 4 might be specific phobia. Age 7 is going to be separation anxiety plus the specific phobia,” says Anne Marie Albano, the director of the Columbia University Clinic for Anxiety and Related Disorders. “Age 12 is going to be separation anxiety, social anxiety, and the specific phobia. Anxiety picks its own friends up first before it branches into the other disorders.” And the earlier it starts, the more likely depression is to follow.</p><p>All of which means we can no longer assume that childhood distress is a phase to be grown out of. “The group of kids whose problems <i>don’t</i> go away account for most adults who have problems,” says the National Institute of Mental Health’s Daniel Pine, a leading authority on how anxiety develops in children. “People go on to develop a whole host of other problems that aren’t anxiety.” Ronald C. Kessler, a professor of health-care policy at Harvard, once <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0307269876/theatla05-20/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'27',r'609079'">made this point especially vividly</a>: “Fear of dogs at age 5 or 10 is important not because fear of dogs impairs the quality of your life,” he said. “Fear of dogs is important because it makes you four times more likely to end up a 25-year-old, depressed, high-school-dropout single mother who is drug-dependent.”</p></section><div class="ad-boxinjector-wrapper"><gpt-ad targeting-pos="boxinjector7" class="ad ad-boxinjector  kvr-injector  " lazy-load="2"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[0, 0]" sizes="[[300, 250],[1, 3],[1,4]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1010, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90],[728, 350],[970, 250],[1,3],[970,350],[1,4]]"></gpt-sizeset></gpt-ad></div><section id="article-section-8"><p>Compounding this, the young kids with mental-health problems today may have worse long-term prospects than did similar kids in decades past.

Sellers found that youth with mental-health problems at age 7 are more likely to be socially isolated and victimized by peers later in childhood, and to have mental-health and academic difficulties at age 16. Concerningly, despite decreased stigma and increases in mental-health-care spending, these associations have been growing stronger over time.</p><p>Big societal shifts such as the ones we’ve undergone in recent years can hit people with particular traits particularly hard. A recent example comes from China, where shy, quiet children used to be well liked and tended to thrive. Following rapid social and economic change in urban areas, values have changed, and these children now tend to be rejected by their peers—and, surely no coincidence, are more prone to depressive symptoms. I thought of this when I met recently with the leaders of a support group for parents of struggling young adults in the Washington, D.C., area, most of whom still live at home. Some of these grown children have psychiatric diagnoses; all have had difficulty with the hurdles and humiliations of life in a deeply competitive culture, one with a narrowing definition of success and a rising cost of living.</p></section><div class="ad-boxinjector-wrapper"><gpt-ad targeting-pos="boxinjector8" class="ad ad-boxinjector  kvr-injector  " lazy-load="2"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[0, 0]" sizes="[[300, 250],[1, 3],[1,4]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1010, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90],[728, 350],[970, 250],[1,3],[970,350],[1,4]]"></gpt-sizeset></gpt-ad></div><section id="article-section-9"><p>The hope of early treatment is that by getting to a child when she’s 7, we may be able to stop or at least slow the distressing trajectory charted by Sellers and other researchers. And cognitive behavioral therapy, the most empirically supported therapy for anxiety, is often sufficient to do just that. In the case of anxiety, CBT typically involves a combination of what’s known as “cognitive restructuring”—learning to spot maladaptive beliefs and challenge them—and exposure to the very things that cause you anxiety. The goal of exposure is to desensitize you to these things and also to give you practice riding out your anxious feelings, rather than avoiding them.</p><p>Most of the time, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702984/pdf/nihms-114481.pdf" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'29',r'609079'">according to the largest and most authoritative study to date</a>, CBT works: After a 12-week course, 60 percent of children with anxiety disorders were “very much improved” or “much improved.” But it isn’t a permanent cure—its <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29960692" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'30',r'609079'">results tend to fade over time</a>, and people whose anxiety resurges may need follow-up courses.</p><figure style="max-width: 672.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:126.339285714%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/03/0520_WEL_Julian_AnxiousChild_1/fa4c14e23.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="credit">Illustration: Oliver Munday; Marco Pasqualini / Getty</figcaption></figure><p>A bigger problem is that cognitive behavioral therapy can only work if the patient is motivated, and many anxious children have approximately zero interest in battling their fears.

But—and this is a big <i>but</i>—there is research establishing a <i>correlation </i>between children’s anxiety and parents’ behavior. SPACE, he continued, is predicated on the simple idea that you can combat a kid’s anxiety disorder by reducing parental accommodation—basically, those things a parent does to alleviate a child’s anxious feelings. If a child is afraid of dogs, an accommodation might be walking her across the street so as to avoid one. If a child is scared of the dark, it might be letting him sleep in your bed.</p><p>Lebowitz borrowed the concept about a decade ago from the literature on how obsessive-compulsive disorder affects a patient’s family members and vice versa. (As he put it to me, family members end up living as though they, too, have OCD: “<i>Everybody’s </i>washing their hands. <i>Everybody’s</i> changing their clothes. <i>Nobody’s</i> saying this word or that word.”) In the years since, accommodation has become a focus of anxiety research. We now know that about 95 percent of parents of anxious children engage in accommodation. We also know that higher degrees of accommodation are associated with more severe anxiety symptoms, more severe impairment, and worse treatment outcomes. These findings have potential implications even for children who are not (yet) clinically anxious: The everyday efforts we make to prevent kids’ distress—minimizing things that worry them or scare them, assisting with difficult tasks rather than letting them struggle—may not help them manage it in the long term. When my daughter is in tears because she hasn’t finished a school project that’s due the next morning, I sometimes stop her crying by coaching her through the rest of it. But when I do, she doesn’t learn to handle deadline jitters. When she asks me whether anyone in our family will die of COVID-19, an unequivocal “No, don’t worry” may reassure her now, but a longer, harder conversation about life’s uncertainties might do more to help her in the future.</p><aside class="pullquote instapaper_ignore">Despite more than a decade’s evidence that helicopter parenting is counterproductive, kids today are perhaps <em>more</em> overprotected, <em>more </em>leery of adulthood, <em>more </em>in need of therapy.</aside><p>Parents know they aren’t helping their kids by accommodating their fears; they tell Lebowitz as much.

As they cope, they’ll come to feel more capable, and they will be treated as such by their parents, who will further reduce accommodation.

The Anxious Parent</b></h3><p>Most critiques of this century’s child-rearing practices have treated parents as rational actors, however extreme some of our actions might be. If we hover above our children (or lawn-mower or bulldoze or snowplow a path for them), we are said to do so in reaction to the surrounding conditions—media coverage of kidnappings, for example, or plummeting college-admission rates. In other words, modern parents, or at least the upper-middle-class ones who populate most articles about parenting trends, are widely perceived not as flailing but as the opposite: too hyper, too competent, too vigilant. And yet, despite more than a decade’s evidence that helicopter parenting is counterproductive—see, among other widely read takedowns, the <i>Atlantic</i> articles “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/07/how-to-land-your-kid-in-therapy/308555/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'33',r'609079'">How to Land Your Kid in Therapy</a>,” by Lori Gottlieb, and “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/04/hey-parents-leave-those-kids-alone/358631/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'34',r'609079'">The Overprotected Kid</a>,” by Hanna Rosin, and such books as Julie Lythcott-Haims’s <i>How to Raise an Adult</i>—<a href="https://time.com/3910020/the-over-parenting-trap-how-to-avoid-checklisted-childhoods-and-raise-adults/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'35',r'609079'">kids today are perhaps <i>more</i> overprotected</a>, <i>more</i> leery of adulthood, <i>more</i> in need of therapy.</p><p>Which raises a question: If modern parents are so unrelentingly on top of things, why have we not corrected course? Could it be that we are not at all on top of things? Might our children’s faltering mental health be related less to our hard-driving style than to our exhaustion and guilt and failure to put our foot down? We complain about kids being thin-skinned and susceptible to peer pressure, but maybe we’re the ones who are hypersensitive, to the judgment of our peers and, especially, of our children. And the harder we try to do the right thing—the more we nurture them, the more quickly we respond to their needs—the more we tie ourselves in knots.</p></section><div class="ad-boxinjector-wrapper"><gpt-ad targeting-pos="boxinjector14" class="ad ad-boxinjector  kvr-injector  " lazy-load="2"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[0, 0]" sizes="[[300, 250],[1, 3],[1,4]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1010, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90],[728, 350],[970, 250],[1,3],[970,350],[1,4]]"></gpt-sizeset></gpt-ad></div><section id="article-section-15"><p>Recently, several longtime commentators on the parenting scene have begun to sound similar notes.

In their hundreds of appearances and thousands of conversations with parents, they have come to believe that parents’ anxiety about their kids is even greater than they had realized, and more concerning. Watching them do a Q&amp;A with private-school parents in December, I could see why.

Day care wasn’t the key factor; parenting was. Fox and Rubin found, and other researchers have since confirmed, that parenting style at age 2 predicts continuing behavioral inhibition at age 4—and, in turn, later risk of psychological problems. As Rubin put it to me: “The kids who maintain reticent behavior are the kids whose parents bubble-wrap them.”</p><h3><b>III. Short-Term Gain, Long-Term Pain</b></h3><p>We all have dreams, and Angela and Seth’s was to stop making turkey loaf.</p><p>By the time they sought help from the SPACE program’s Yaara Shimshoni last year, they had served it to their then-6-year-old son, Owen, some 3,000 times. (I have changed parents’ and children’s names.) Put another way, virtually every day for four years—two-thirds of his life—Owen had eaten turkey loaf for both lunch and dinner. For breakfast, he favored dry Cheerios.</p><p>Calling Owen a picky eater wouldn’t have captured the extent of the problem. He was terrified of most foods. On those rare occasions when he tasted something new, he would gag. Going out together as a family was a minor ordeal: Either they packed turkey loaf to take with them, or they hurried home before the next meal. Mostly, the family just stayed in. “If we ran out of it, Owen would have an absolute fit,” Seth said when he and Angela spoke with me in February. Once, after a supermarket strike disrupted the local turkey supply, he spent the night driving from store to store, searching for enough meat to get through the week.</p></section><div class="ad-boxinjector-wrapper"><gpt-ad targeting-pos="boxinjector18" class="ad ad-boxinjector  kvr-injector  " lazy-load="2"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[0, 0]" sizes="[[300, 250],[1, 3],[1,4]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1010, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90],[728, 350],[970, 250],[1,3],[970,350],[1,4]]"></gpt-sizeset></gpt-ad></div><section id="article-section-19"><p>Trying to understand how two down-to-earth-sounding people had found themselves in this predicament, I asked Angela and Seth whether they had been fans of turkey loaf to begin with. Was the recipe an old family favorite? “Oh God, no,” Seth said, horrified, explaining that they’d found it on a kids’-food blog when Owen was a toddler. “Disgusting,” Angela said with conviction. “It looks like prison food,” Seth added. They were very clear about another thing, too: They hadn’t simply found themselves in this predicament; over the course of their 12-week program with Shimshoni, they’d concluded that they’d helped create it. “Owen started off with eating issues”—he had been born prematurely and stayed in the NICU for a month because he refused to feed—“and we started getting our own anxieties” is how Seth put it. “I thought that I was doing the right thing by just keeping him happy and making him comfortable,” Angela said.</p><p>As ready as Owen’s parents were to take responsibility for his issues, I couldn’t help but notice the role played by something else: time, and the juggling acts parents develop to compensate for the lack of it. Owen wouldn’t have been fed turkey loaf 3,000 times had he and his parents been sharing meals; they wouldn’t have stood for it. But, like many parents, they staggered their work schedules. Seth picked Owen up at day care and fed him dinner. He and Angela ate later, after Owen was asleep. One of the first changes Shimshoni recommended was that they begin having dinner as a family. Owen didn’t have to eat everything his parents ate, but he could choose only from among the foods on the table—no substitutions. After dinner, the kitchen closed for the night. Shimshoni says her goal is not to turn a picky eater into an omnivore, but to get a kid like Owen to the point where he can find something to eat in most situations. When I spoke with Angela and Seth, Owen was several months into his post-SPACE life. He isn’t an adventurous eater, but he now gets by without bringing turkey loaf everywhere.</p></section><div class="ad-boxinjector-wrapper"><gpt-ad targeting-pos="boxinjector19" class="ad ad-boxinjector  kvr-injector  " lazy-load="2"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[0, 0]" sizes="[[300, 250],[1, 3],[1,4]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1010, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90],[728, 350],[970, 250],[1,3],[970,350],[1,4]]"></gpt-sizeset></gpt-ad></div><section id="article-section-20"><p>If the instinct to protect a child leads many of us into the trap of overparenting, I’ve come to believe that time pressures keep us there. In conversation after conversation with parents who were struggling to reduce a child’s dependency and fearfulness, rushed weekday mornings and evenings emerged as the crucible in which bad habits had formed. Eli Lebowitz makes much the same point. “One of the reasons parents accommodate is a child in distress, but another big reason is <i>I want to get my child to school</i>. That is a powerful driver too,” he said: “<i>I have to get to work after I drop you at school.</i>”</p><p>Ruthie Arbit, a therapist who specializes in maternal and pediatric mental health, observes that for mothers, especially, time pressure can be compounded by guilt. “When there’s all the guilt that, as a working parent, I missed X, Y, Z,” she told me, “it’s a lot harder to follow through with an unpleasant behavioral intervention.” And if you have only an hour with your child at night, you’d like it to be a pleasant one. A parent’s own underlying anxiety may also come to the fore. More than once in my interviews with SPACE parents and clinicians, I found myself thinking of the program as a form of exposure therapy not just for kids but for parents: If we learn to tolerate our children’s discomfort, we can stop getting in the way of their efforts to cope with it.</p><p class="dropcap"><span class="smallcaps">Therapists who treat anxiety</span> like to talk about how short-term pain leads to long-term gain—how enduring discomfort now can make you more resilient later. In recent decades, however, the opposite principle has guided many American parents, and not only when it comes to the parenting of anxious children: On everything from toilet training to eating and sleeping habits, many of our parenting strategies trade short-term gain (a few minutes saved here, a conflict averted there) for long-term pain.</p></section><div class="ad-boxinjector-wrapper"><gpt-ad targeting-pos="boxinjector20" class="ad ad-boxinjector  kvr-injector  " lazy-load="2"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[0, 0]" sizes="[[300, 250],[1, 3],[1,4]]"></gpt-sizeset><gpt-sizeset viewport-size="[1010, 0]" sizes="[[728, 90],[728, 350],[970, 250],[1,3],[970,350],[1,4]]"></gpt-sizeset></gpt-ad></div><section id="article-section-21"><p>That we would cut corners in this way is maybe inevitable in a country that lacks adequate parental leave or quality, affordable child care; one in which school and employment schedules are misaligned, and in which our work culture expects employees to always be on. Add to the mix a permissive streak in American child-rearing, one that has simultaneously indulged children and encouraged their independence, and you have an extremely labor-intensive recipe for parental misery. “The accusation that American mothers coddle their children is not new,” writes the historian Paula S. Fass in her 2016 book, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691162577/the-end-of-american-childhood" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'43',r'609079'"><i>The End of American Childhood</i></a>—but its recent combination with maternal employment has made for especially overburdened lives. By way of illustrating the point, she relates the contrast that Sara Harkness and Charles Super, two ethnographers, have drawn between American and Dutch parents:</p><blockquote>American parents much more frequently emphasize individual attention, active interaction, and the developmental needs of the child … Dutch parents put their faith in regularity of habits (rest, quiet, and cleanliness) and family time together, especially around meals … One result of these different goals in households equally devoted to children’s welfare was that American parents were often tired and appeared frazzled. They tended to complain about their children’s sleeping habits and gave in to their demands because they were too exhausted to fight in the middle of the night.</blockquote><p>The problem isn’t that American parents aren’t trying; if anything we’re trying <i>too</i> hard, but in ways that backfire, leaving us less time for the things that matter most. At a lab I visited at the University of Maryland, I learned about <a href="https://www.umdrubinlab.com/preschool-shyness-study.html" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'44',r'609079'">the Turtle Program</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6163041/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'45',r'609079'">an intervention that</a>, among other things, directs parents to set aside five minutes of “special time” each day with their behaviorally inhibited preschoolers, to be spent doing whatever the child chooses, with no directions or corrections given by parents. Parents told me how thirstily their children had drunk up this modest amount of time, so I tried it on my (non-anxious) 6-year-old. He was at first incredulous and then overjoyed. I realized, in dismay, just how divided my attention is most of the time, and how many of our interactions are dominated by my telling him to do this or not to do that, especially when I am rushing.</p><p>Changes in the way we’ve approached toilet training are a particularly dramatic example of how something that seems child-friendly can turn out to be parent-unfriendly and therefore everyone-unfriendly. As the early-childhood expert Erika Christakis notes in <i>The Importance of Being Little</i>, the age at which children are toilet trained has crept up over time. Several decades ago, 60 percent of 18-month-olds were fully trained. Studies earlier this century show only about half of American children being toilet trained by age 3, and today it’s not uncommon to see 4-year-olds wearing Pull-Ups. Some people have attributed this to a move away from harsh, old-school training methods, but I wonder whether an equal problem isn’t parents’ lack of time. Around my daughter’s second birthday, I saw a copy of <i>Potty Training for Dummies</i> by the register at Buy Buy Baby and impulsively bought it. I might not have, had I realized that it prescribed a festive three-day boot camp mortifyingly called “Potty Mambo Weekend.” In any case, the approach worked—but in conversations, I noticed how overwhelmed some friends seemed by the idea. Who had three days to spare? And yet, as Christakis notes, “time spent changing diapers is surely worth something, too.” (Delayed potty training makes for a strange contrast with the fact that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/01/the-new-preschool-is-crushing-kids/419139/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'46',r'609079'">many preschools have recently become more academic</a>. The split screen between the two things—learning to read and write, still in diapers—foreshadows the situation later on, when high-school kids shoulder intense academic pressure even as many are behind in developing life skills.)</p><p class="c-recirculation-link" data-id="injected-recirculation-link" id="injected-recirculation-link-3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/the-dangers-of-distracted-parenting/561752/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'47',r'609079'">From July/August 2018: Erika Christakis on the dangers of distracted parenting</a></p><p>Or consider sleep. Whichever side one takes in the wars over infant sleep-training and bed-sharing, as children grow older, it can be easy to fall into the trap of privileging one night’s sleep over long-term sleep skills.

One explanation for this strange fact, as has been widely noted, is that kids today spend less time on their own. But a second, as we’ve just seen, is that parents really are doing more for their kids—and many kids are doing less for themselves.</p><h3><b>IV. Failure to Launch</b></h3><p>For one hint of just how much parenting style may influence a child’s anxiety level, consider the diverging paths of boys and girls.</p><p>“There is no greater risk factor for anxiety disorders than being born female,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/books/tell-us-5-things-about-your-book-andrea-petersen-on-living-with-and-studying-anxiety.html" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'49',r'609079'">Andrea Petersen writes in <i>On Edge</i>, her exploration of anxiety</a>. “Women are about twice as likely as men to develop one, and women’s illnesses generally last longer, have more severe symptoms, and are more disabling.” Weirdly enough, females start off the less anxious sex; male newborns are the fussy, irritable ones. Various theories have been advanced as to why women end up more fearful and inhibited than men, but to my mind the most convincing is that, when we were kids, adults responded disparately to our fears. “When girls are anxious, adults are more likely to be protective and allow them to avoid scary situations. Boys are told to suck it up … It is as if boys are engaged in continual exposure therapy,” Petersen writes, going on to detail a damning body of research showing how parents have, through the decades, encouraged bravery and independence in boys while discouraging those traits in girls.</p><p>Maybe the way to think about recent parenting is this: All kids today are being overprotected the way only girls used to be. Except the changes in childhood are far broader than that. Even girls, after all, used to get themselves around the neighborhood and have summer jobs and chores. Today, <a href="https://nhts.ornl.gov/assets/FHWA_NHTS_%20Brief_Traveltoschool_032519.pdf" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'50',r'609079'">only 10 percent of kids walk or bicycle to school</a>, a steep decline from decades past.

When I began interviewing clinicians, I was struck by how many of them talked about the importance of learning to endure emotional upset as well as physical distress and even pain. (Elisa Nebolsine, a child therapist who specializes in CBT, told me that when she meets parents, one of her first questions is: “How does your kid do being uncomfortable, being tired, being hot, being hungry?”) This message was so consistent, in fact, that some of the therapists started to sound like members of a cult with a sadistic bent. But I came to understand their concern. The more I thought about it, the more I saw myself shielding my kids from even the mild discomforts of my own childhood. Unless I had a high fever as a child, I was never given an analgesic. Why was I so ready to dole out liquid Tylenol, and in a choice of flavors? Speaking of flavors, why was I buying Crest Kid’s Sparkle Fun Toothpaste at a 50 percent markup over regular, I mean “spicy,” toothpaste (the only kind I knew as a child)? And why was I vetting my kids’ movie selections on Common Sense Media, a website that exhaustively catalogs frightening or otherwise objectionable content in children’s entertainment?</p><p>Doing chores and getting oneself where one needs to go also provide another, more obvious benefit: a sense of personal competence. This may be why <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2015/12/08/research-indicates-sparing-chores-spoils-children-and-their-future-selves/ZLvMznpC5btmHtNRXXhNFJ/story.html" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'53',r'609079'">doing chores from age 3 or 4 onward has been found to be a very strong predictor of academic, professional, and relational success</a> in young adulthood. Obviously many people do just fine in life without ever having a summer job or walking themselves to school. But these developments combine with the recent changes in child-rearing and technology to create a particularly toxic combination: teenagers with a deficit of life skills, a lack of practice weathering the frustrations to which that deficit may lead, and the means to retreat and distract themselves from those frustrations.</p><p class="dropcap"><span class="smallcaps">Over the past five years,</span> the age at which most kids get a smartphone has continued to tick downward. In 2015, according to a study by Common Sense Media, 32 percent of 11-year-olds had one; last year, 53 percent did. Several factors appear to be driving this and related trends. For kids of all ages, screens are cheap and reliable babysitters (see: time famine). Some parents embrace phones because they enable tracking of kids (see: parental anxiety). Others surrender to demands for technology because they can’t tolerate either their own kids’ anger or peer pressure from other kids’ parents.

But if you have an anxiety disorder and want to avoid things—other people, say, or the outside world—various aspects of digital life are ideally (meaning disastrously) suited to that goal. This appears to be especially true for two groups in particular. The first is <a href="https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/podcasts/failure-launch-shaping-intervention-highly-dependent-adult" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'56',r'609079'">young adults experiencing failure to launch</a>—not working or attending school, and dependent on their parents.

One key tactic is to strategically limit internet access when it seems to be making avoidance of something too comfortable—much the way he tries to limit parental accommodation. In school-refusal cases, for example, he counsels that if a kid is home during the school day, she shouldn’t have access to things she wouldn’t have if she were at school: TVs, phones, tablets, video games, parental attention, even recreational reading. “Books are highly entertaining, and boredom is our <i>ally </i>in this particular struggle,” Lebowitz explained during the SPACE training I attended.</p><p>This was the only moment in the two-day workshop when I heard participants express skepticism—our lives were too enmeshed with tech, they suggested, and kids were too tech savvy; removing internet access, even for a school day, was a lost cause. Lebowitz held firm. If you want to, you can. TV connected to the wall? Take the cord and the remote to work. Too many devices to keep track of? Get Circle, an access controller that attaches to your router. He is hair-on-fire about this point: For vulnerable kids, on-demand internet access makes hiding out much too comfortable. “It’s almost like the internet is devised to enable these problems, because you’re not naturally bored,” he said. “You can have social stimulation without the social stress of actual people.”</p><p>Lebowitz published <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22428713" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'58',r'609079'">a small study in 2012 on his work with parents of failure-to-launch young adults</a> and has since treated a few dozen more families, with promising results. He says one of the most gratifying parts of his work is when, years later, he gets letters from parents with updates on a son or daughter who has finally gone to college or gotten married or otherwise picked up a life that was on hold. In February, I talked with the parents of one such young adult, Andy, who is in his early 20s. When Clive and Nora started working with Lebowitz, early last year, Andy hadn’t attended school regularly in several years, due to a stew of learning issues, depression, and anxiety. He was enrolled in a private high school, though he essentially never went. They had tried, with mixed success, different therapies, but eventually he refused help. Most of the time, he stayed in his room.</p><aside class="pullquote instapaper_ignore">The more overwhelming the world gets, the more adults try to blindfold children.</aside><p>Lebowitz encouraged Clive and Nora to pick a single goal—Andy finishing high school—and to focus on how their accommodations (housing Andy, feeding him, giving him a car and a phone and Wi-Fi) were helping him avoid it. Jumping back into school overnight was unrealistic, so Lebowitz advised breaking the goal into achievable steps. The first, which lasted for a few weeks, was for Andy to get himself to school every day. He didn’t have to go to class, but he did need to send his parents a selfie proving that he’d been there; if he didn’t, they would withhold internet access for 24 hours.</p><p>When Clive and Nora announced this plan, Andy said it was really stupid. But within a day or two, he was complying, and he took more small steps in the months that followed. He started dating, and even had a girlfriend for several months; today, he’s almost finished with high school. Clive and Nora’s own thinking and behavior have also shifted radically. Nora says that if she had known sooner what she knows now, she would have reacted far less to Andy’s anxiety from the beginning. “Even when he was 4 or 5, he would ask me to stay home from school, and I often accommodated that,” she said. Clive now realizes that the more he helped Andy solve problems over the years, the worse Andy’s own problem-solving skills got.</p><p>This isn’t to say that the past year has been entirely smooth; along the way Nora and Clive have repeatedly been tempted to swoop in and help. One example of this has stuck with me. When Andy skipped school for a few days, they turned off the internet, so he began using his phone’s data and soon ran out. He wanted to go see his girlfriend, but he didn’t know how to get to her house without Waze, so he started sending his parents panicked texts, asking what they expected him to do. In turn they had a crisis of confidence. They wanted him out of the house and seeing people. Should they buy him more data? They called Lebowitz. “It’s not your problem,” he told them. “Just say, ‘We trust that you will find your way.’ ”</p><p>And he did.</p><h3><b>V. “Draw the Earthquake”</b></h3><p>Parenting style is not the only thing that can fortify our kids. Sleep, exercise, and friendship all confer tremendous psychological benefits, and are within our powers to promote, both individually and societally. A morally more urgent task is to reduce poverty, instability, and deep trauma (as opposed to ordinary stress) in children’s lives; research on these adverse childhood experiences demonstrates the overwhelming risk they pose to psychological functioning. The lack of children’s mental-health care is another pressing problem: Most children who need it don’t get it, and what they do get tends not to be evidence-based care (such as CBT). Finally, if we want to create the conditions for children’s mental health, we must first create the conditions for adult sanity, in the form of more support for families. It’s been said that a society that cares about children must also care about parents. That’s undoubtedly true. It’s also been said that a parent is only as happy as her unhappiest child. That’s true too, though, again, the relationship runs both ways. The more our unhappy children worry, the more we worry about them, and the more we worry about them, the more we do the very things that lead their worries to flourish.</p><p class="c-recirculation-link" data-id="injected-recirculation-link" id="injected-recirculation-link-5"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/active-shooter-drills-erika-christakis/580426/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'59',r'609079'">From March 2019: Erika Christakis on how active shooter drills are tragically misguided</a></p><p>Of the many cutting portrayals of modern motherhood offered up by HBO’s <i>Big Little Lies</i>, the most evocative may be the episode in which Amabella, the second-grade daughter of Renata (played by Laura Dern), has a panic attack at school and passes out. A child therapist is dispatched, and reports that young Amabella is worried about the planet. “Her class is evidently talking about climate change,” the therapist explains. “She’s gotten the message that we’re doomed.” Renata is livid at the school for spilling the beans, as are other parents; a meeting is convened with the principal, who limply declares anxiety “an epidemic in our schools.” Because it is <i>Big Little Lies</i>, the particulars are over the top (Renata promises, or threatens, to “buy a fucking polar bear” for each kid), but the angst is recognizable.</p><figure style="max-width: 672.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:124.702380952%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/03/0520_WEL_Julian_AnxiousChild_4/f5beb450a.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="credit">Illustration: Oliver Munday; Nick David / Getty</figcaption></figure><p>When I spoke with Kathryn L. Humphreys, a psychology professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in the effects of caregiving in early life, she observed a widespread hesitancy to talk about depressing concepts with kids. Parents seem to feel that doing so is “developmentally inappropriate,” she mused, though this strikes her as exactly backwards given what we know about the benefits of graduated exposure to things that frighten us. Humphreys listens to the news after work, and her 4-year-old daughter will often ask tough questions. She told me she understands why people are concerned about having difficult conversations with kids, and yet, she asked, “At what age is it that you think kids <i>are</i> capable of that?” Scary things are happening all the time, and avoiding them—“We’re just gonna turn off the news!” as she put it—won’t change that. “Sometimes it’s the avoidance that makes it harder for kids who are anxious,” she added.</p><p>In my experience, this cloistering extends to everything from the Holocaust to sex. I’m surprised by how many of my friends think their fourth and fifth graders don’t know how babies are made. Meanwhile, the efforts parents make to promote belief in, for example, Santa Claus seem more fervent than ever, via tools like Elf on the Shelf and apps that supposedly show Santa’s visit to your home. One of the more revealing mommy-board threads I’ve encountered began with an irate warning titled “Super Fudge book outs Santa as fake.” More than 100 people jumped into the outraged fray that followed, all over a revelation in a classic Judy Blume novel that’s aimed at third-to-sixth graders and that came out <i>four decades ago</i>. So we find ourselves with a bizarre mishmash: Some adults think their fourth graders believe in Santa Claus and don’t know how babies are made while other adults—or maybe some of the same adults—think fourth graders should have smartphones. In another era, the desire to keep kids in the dark might not be a problem, but it’s a strange combination with the easy access many of them now have to Pornhub and viral videos of real-life violence.</p><p>As I contemplate the likelihood that my kids’ lives will be more stressful than mine, my mind keeps wandering to two children’s drawings reproduced in the pediatrician W. Thomas Boyce’s book <i>The Orchid and the Dandelion: Why Some Children Struggle and How All Can Thrive</i>. Both depict California’s 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which killed dozens of people—and also, as chance would have it, occurred midway through a study Boyce was conducting of whether stress increased local children’s susceptibility to illness. Naturally, he and his team expanded the study to incorporate their reactions to the disaster, and they asked each child to “draw the earthquake.” The kids’ responses varied dramatically. Some produced cheerful pictures—“homes with minor damage, happy families, and smiling yellow suns”—while others generated scenes of destruction and injury, fear and sadness. To Boyce’s fascination, children who drew darker scenes tended to stay healthy in the weeks that followed, while those who drew sunny pictures were more likely to come down with infections and illnesses.</p><p>Boyce now believes it was protective for children to create “honest, even brutal depictions of a no-doubt-about-it disaster.” We talk about things that scare us, he ventures, “because it makes them gradually less scary; about sadness, because it makes the sadness diminish a little each time we do.” I am drawn to this story in part because in 1989 I was 11 years old, I lived in the Bay Area, and I was deeply, morbidly fascinated by the earthquake and its human toll. But I am also attracted to it because its moral is at odds with the way adults so often try to shield children from difficult topics. In fact, it sometimes seems that the more overwhelming the world gets, the more adults try to blindfold children.</p><p>In the end, one lesson we might derive from everything scientists and clinicians have learned about anxiety is this: If we want to prepare our kids for difficult times, we should let them fail at things now, and allow them to encounter obstacles and to talk candidly about worrisome topics. To be very clear, this is not a cure-all for mental illness. What we need to recognize, though, is that our current approach to childhood doesn’t reduce basic human vulnerabilities. It exacerbates them.</p><hr><p><small><em>This article appears in the May 2020 print edition with the headline “Childhood in an Anxious Age.”</em></small></p><hr><p><small><a id="Correction" name="Correction" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'60',r'609079'"></a><a href="#Doubled" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'61',r'609079'">*</a></small> <em><small>This article originally stated that more than a quarter of doctor visits end with a prescription for an anti-anxiety medication.
