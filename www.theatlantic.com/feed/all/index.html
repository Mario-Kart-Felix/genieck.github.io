Madrigal and Robinson Meyer, who launched &lt;a href="https://covidtracking.com/"&gt;a project tracking state-by-state testing progress&lt;/a&gt;, write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One statistic highlights the extent of the cases that the U.S. could be missing. Alexis and Rob evaluated a metric called the test-positivity rate, which estimates how many people who are tested for the virus are found to have it. In the U.S., that rate is 20 percent. That’s very high—and implies that doctors are testing only those patients with a very high likelihood of having the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The positivity rate doesn’t tell us the proportion of coronavirus cases in the U.S., but it can give us a general sense of how drastic a particular outbreak is. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/us-coronavirus-outbreak-out-control-test-positivity-rate/610132/?utm_source=feed"&gt;In America’s case, it shows that the outbreak is far from under control.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to read if … you just want practical advice:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 2019 drew to a close, a young woman, Niuniu, and her fiancé, Tongsheng, looked forward to a bright future. In the spring, as the cherry blossoms fell in Wuhan, the couple would get married. They had started saving up to buy a house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a month later, however, their dreams came to a grinding halt. An animated short documentary from Olmo Parenti, based on a series of Niuniu’s WeChats, tells the heartrending story of Tongsheng’s battle with COVID-19. Like many victims of this pandemic, Tongsheng had difficulty accessing medical care. In mid-January, he died alone in a hospital waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federica Fruhwirth’s animations bring Niuniu and Tongsheng’s tragic story to life with a simplicity that foregrounds Niuniu’s narration. “The goal was to let the viewer focus on the narration and the temporal escalation in events,” Parenti told me, “We didn’t want the animations to be frenetic and exciting; we wanted the visuals to match the delicacy and pace of Niuniu’s writing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most affecting part of Niuniu’s story is a letter that Tongsheng wrote, addressed to Niuniu’s future boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Congratulations on being Niuniu’s boyfriend!” the letter reads. “I envy you because you have my same talent. You managed to be with a woman so beautiful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reading that letter was a heartbreaking experience,” Parenti said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter goes on to lightheartedly warn the future boyfriend of Niuniu’s shortcomings—and to encourage him to love her unconditionally nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Emily Buder</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/emily-buder/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2020/04/Boyfriend_Wuhan/lead_960.jpg"></media:content><title type="html">‘My Boyfriend Died of COVID-19’</title><published>2020-04-20T15:21:42-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T15:21:42-04:00</updated><summary type="html">In Wuhan, a young woman and her fiancé’s dreams are shattered.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/610198/boyfriend-died-in-wuhan/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610285</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If he wants to attack Donald Trump’s response to COVID-19, Joe Biden has an embarrassment of options. The presumptive Democratic nominee could slam Trump for &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html?action=click&amp;amp;amp;module=Spotlight&amp;amp;amp;pgtype=hinytmynameisben"&gt;ignoring&lt;/a&gt; his own advisers’ warnings about the potential severity of the virus. Biden could skewer the president for his administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/health/cdc-coronavirus-lab-contamination-testing.html"&gt;inability to develop&lt;/a&gt; a coronavirus test. He could blast the Trump administration for failing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/3/21206170/us-emergency-stockpile-jared-kushner-almost-empty-coronavirus-medical-supplies-ventilators"&gt;to adequately stockpile&lt;/a&gt; personal protective equipment. He could condemn the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/?utm_source=feed"&gt;large quantities of misinformation&lt;/a&gt; that Trump has propagated about the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the moment, however, Biden has chosen a different angle: He’s attacking Trump for knuckling under to Beijing. Yesterday, the Biden campaign &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/coronavirus-trump-china-biden-ad_n_5e9b2159c5b63639081f5d15"&gt;unveiled an ad&lt;/a&gt;—filled with menacing images of Chinese soldiers—claiming that “Trump rolled over for the Chinese.” It follows another &lt;a href="https://americanbridgepac.org/trump-china-trust/"&gt;spot&lt;/a&gt;, paid for by the pro-Biden super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, depicting the incumbent as a stooge for Beijing. “Everyone knew they lied about the virus—China,” a narrator declares, against the backdrop of a fluttering Chinese flag. “President Trump gave China his trust.” On &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/coronavirus-turns-china-2020-election-issue-trump-biden-clash-n1186611"&gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;, the Biden adviser Antony Blinken &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/politics/trump-china-virus.html"&gt;told reporters&lt;/a&gt; that “the president praised China and President Xi more than 15 times.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/trump-is-the-chinese-governments-most-useful-idiot/608638/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Adam Serwer: Trump is inciting a coronavirus culture war to save himself&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden camp’s logic is easy to understand. Trump has made China the primary scapegoat for his failures. His supporters are &lt;a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/04/17/america_first_action_pac_launches_beijing_biden_ads_stop_china_stop_joe_biden.html"&gt;running ads&lt;/a&gt; under the hashtag #BeijingBiden. So Biden and his strategists are meeting fire with fire. They’re answering the charge that the former vice president is soft on China by saying that Trump is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This form of ideological jujitsu comes naturally to Democrats of Biden’s generation, who in the 1990s tried to turn the tables on Republicans who had been painting them as antibusiness, anti-military, and pro-criminal during the Nixon and Reagan eras. In 1992, Bill Clinton ran for president &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/23/us/1992-campaign-assessment-clinton-s-retreat-change-tax-cut-for-middle-class-could.html"&gt;promising&lt;/a&gt; to cut taxes. In 2000, Al Gore &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/future/agenda/"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; to spend more on the military than George W. Bush. And in 1994, after successfully shepherding Clinton’s crime bill through the Senate, Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/09/joe-biden-crime-bill-and-americans-short-memory/597547/?utm_source=feed"&gt;crowed&lt;/a&gt;, “The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is now for 60 new death penalties … The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 125,000 new state prison cells … I’d like to see the conservative wing of the Democratic Party.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, beating the GOP at its own game was at times politically shrewd. Clinton’s ghoulish enthusiasm for the death penalty—which in 1992 led him to leave the campaign trail to oversee the execution of the mentally disabled murderer Ricky Ray Rector—probably helped inoculate him from the soft-on-crime attacks that had helped sink Michael Dukakis in 1988. Still, Biden’s decision to try to out-hawk Trump on China has three major problems. First, it promotes bad foreign policy. Second, it could stoke anti-Chinese racism. Third, it doesn’t even make long-term sense politically. Republicans, who promoted economic integration with China in the past, are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/politics/trump-china-virus.html"&gt;now committing themselves&lt;/a&gt; to a cold war with China. If Democrats think that’s a political environment in which they’ll thrive, they’re making a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the policy. The implication of Biden’s new ad is that China didn’t give Trump timely information about the COVID-19 outbreak, because Trump wasn’t tough enough on China’s leaders. The &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/coronavirus-trump-china-biden-ad_n_5e9b2159c5b63639081f5d15"&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt; mocks Trump’s praise for Xi Jinping and is filled with supposedly damning images of Trump and Xi together. By contrast, it shows Biden vowing, “I would be on the phone with China making it clear: We are going to need to be in your country. You have to be open. You have to be clear. We have to know what’s going on.” In other words, Biden would boss the Chinese around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/chinas-covid-19-conspiracy-theories/609772/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Renée DiResta: For China, the ‘USA virus’ is a geopolitical ploy&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a jingoistic fantasy. China is a rival superpower run by an authoritarian and fiercely nationalistic regime. Biden can’t force it to comply. When Beijing has given the United States valuable information about virus outbreaks in the past, it’s because American presidents spent time and money building &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/breaking-china-exactly-wrong-answer/608911/?utm_source=feed"&gt;joint U.S.-Chinese initiatives&lt;/a&gt; and took pains to make China’s leaders feel like equals. In 2009, Biden’s then-boss, Barack Obama, stood on a stage with the Chinese leader Hu Jintao in Beijing—in the kind of scene Biden mocks in his ad—and &lt;a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/joint-press-statement-president-obama-and-president-hu-china"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the two governments should “build upon our mutual interests and engage on the basis of equality and mutual respect.” The two leaders &lt;a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/realitycheck/the-press-office/us-china-joint-statement"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that they would “deepen cooperation on global public health issues, including Influenza A (H1N1) prevention, surveillance, reporting and control.” As the Rand Corporation’s Jennifer Huang Bouey has &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/testimonies/CT523.html"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, this cooperation hastened the development of an H1N1 vaccine. In suggesting that Biden could bludgeon China into submission—in a phone call, no less—the Biden campaign is peddling a lie about how public-health cooperation with China actually works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second problem with Biden’s attempt at ideological jujitsu is that, as with the crime bill, vulnerable people may get hurt. Democratic presidential candidates have bashed China before. But this isn’t an ordinary moment. The coronavirus—and Trump’s racist rhetoric about it—have sparked a horrifying &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/chinese-coronavirus-racist-attacks.html"&gt;rise in attacks&lt;/a&gt; on Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans. To his credit, Biden has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1223727977361338370?s=20"&gt;condemned&lt;/a&gt; Trump’s “xenophobia and fear-mongering.” Without meaning to, however, his new ads may exacerbate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/04/chinese-americans-pandemic-flashback/609400/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Chinese Americans have seen this before&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A presidential candidate can, of course, attack the Chinese government without attacking Chinese Americans. But doing so requires some rhetorical finesse—something the Biden ad lacks. The ad doesn’t say that Trump “rolled over” for “Xi Jinping” or the “Chinese government” or even “China.” It says he rolled over for “the Chinese.” As a result, Kaiser Kuo, editor at large of the website SupChina, told me, the ad may contribute to a political “race to the bottom,” in which “Asian Americans will suffer even more terribly from racism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were the Biden camp’s anti-China ads a surefire winner with voters, Machiavellians might justify them as a necessary evil. But for Democrats, posturing as more anti-China than the GOP is a poor long-term bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Republicans—such as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/politics/trump-china-virus.html"&gt;Trump, Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio, and Josh Hawley&lt;/a&gt;—stoking antagonism toward China makes ideological sense. The GOP is the party of military spending, national sovereignty, and white anxiety. For decades, Republicans have been looking for a new Ronald Reagan to lead them to victory over a new evil empire. They’ve tried Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. But China is the most credible candidate yet: a nonwhite, non-Christian, nominally Communist power that really can challenge America’s dominance in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/china-trolling-world-and-avoiding-blame/608332/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Shadi Hamid: China is avoiding blame by trolling the world&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats are by nature the party that advocates spending on health care and education rather than on military confrontation. Democrats are the people who now say, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/02/poll-us-voters-really-do-care-about-climate-change/606907/?utm_source=feed"&gt;in some polls&lt;/a&gt;, that climate change is their second-highest priority. You can’t view the climate threat as existential and simultaneously embrace a cold war that keeps the world’s two largest emitters of carbon dioxide from cooperating. Hawks won’t find the Democrats’ anti-China posturing credible. Even if a few Never Trumpers abandon the GOP in 2020, they’ll eventually come home to Cotton’s or Rubio’s or Nikki Haley’s more respectable militarism. And in trying to out-jingo the GOP, Democrats will alienate their Millennial activist base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2005, after two decades of Democrats like Biden and Clinton seeking to beat the GOP at its own game, the historian Rick Perlstein wrote a short book entitled &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stock-Ticker-Superjumbo-Democrats-Political/dp/0976147505"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stock Ticker and the Superjumbo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Perlstein argued that for a political party, as for a corporation (“Superjumbo” is a reference to Boeing’s competition with Airbus), short-term gyrations in response to the vagaries of the market (the “stock ticker”) can have devastating long-term effects if they undermine its core identity. Clinton—who passed free-trade deals, deregulated the financial markets, cut welfare benefits, signed legislation against gay marriage, and helped fill America’s jails—won two presidential elections. But toward the end of his tenure, Democrats &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/02/clinton-and-the-democrats/302112/?utm_source=feed"&gt;controlled fewer Senate seats and fewer state legislatures than they had in 50 years, and fewer governorships than they had in 30 years&lt;/a&gt;. Clinton had won; the Democratic Party had lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By attacking Trump for being insufficiently nationalist rather than being insufficiently internationalist, Biden is hastening a geopolitical confrontation that threatens progressive goals. And he’s sowing doubts about what the Democratic Party actually believes. He’s choosing short-term advantage over long-term principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what supporters of Bernie Sanders were worried about, and Biden is proving them right.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Peter Beinart</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/peter-beinart/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/AP_893645479401/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Lintao Zhang / AP</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Utter Futility of Biden’s China Rhetoric</title><published>2020-04-20T13:40:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T14:51:15-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The Democratic candidate tries to out-hawk Trump, but trying to beat Republicans at their own game is pointless—even dangerous.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/futility-bidens-china-hawkery/610285/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610240</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On this episode of &lt;em&gt;Social Distance&lt;/em&gt;, staff writer Ashley Fetters joins Katherine Wells and James Hamblin to discuss her most recent article, “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/04/why-exes-are-reconnecting-coronavirus-quarantine/610081/?utm_source=feed"&gt;The Boomerang Exes of Quarantine&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to the episode here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="no" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://player.megaphone.fm/ATL7880185113" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subscribe to Social Distance on &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1502770015"&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/60YRpZwOSq0GPqGXrfpzut?si=v1You0IDRlSAkZrQrEAxEA"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, or another podcast platform to receive new episodes as soon as they’re published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What follows is an edited and condensed transcript of their conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katherine Wells&lt;/strong&gt;: Our question for you today is this: On a micro level, should you text your ex right now? And on a macro level, what is happening to feelings and relationships in this strange time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: Ashley, what is happening to feelings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m glad you asked, because right now that seems to be my entire beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s tackle that first question—is it okay to text your ex right now? I think the reason why you text your ex is a big factor here. Some people are texting their exes right now out of boredom or loneliness. Some people are trying to satisfy some sort of lingering romantic or sexual desire when they don't really have access to new people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: This is happening right now, right? This is a trend that people are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, this is definitely happening. I first heard about it from people who were receiving these texts, and the recipients were asking, “Are anyone else’s exes coming out of the woodwork right now?” That gave me the tip that maybe this is something to look into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I looked into it. And what I found was that, yes, some people felt that their exes were texting them, getting back in touch after weeks, months, even years of radio silence, just because they were lonely and bored and maybe horny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other reason people are texting their exes is to patch things up or to clear the air or apologize. One of the more compelling things I heard in my reporting was something called terror-management theory, which is this idea that when people are confronted with their own mortality, they start to seek meaning. They start to think about religion more and also things like their personal relationships and their family relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people right now are confronting, some of them for the first time, this idea that death is very possible and very close. And they are feeling this impulse of &lt;em&gt;I should apologize to this person&lt;/em&gt; or maybe &lt;em&gt;I should clear the air and get back on good terms with this person&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;I should resolve this conflict that I let linger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: So it’s not about the other person. It’s about the reacher-outer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: As always, yes. A lot of these people are confronting this idea of &lt;em&gt;I could die&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: I like that your two alternatives are that people are either experiencing tremendous existential grief and trying to put things in order so that their soul can be at peace forever, or they’re horny. How would one go about distinguishing, if they were to read a text message, what the motive on the other end might be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: If you receive one of these text messages, or if you’re sending them, a “you up?” text has an air of impulsivity that’s palpable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you have a sense of how many of these reach-outs are genuinely motivated by concern for the other person? Do you think that’s happening a lot, or is it just weird stuff about mortality and sex?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: When I started reporting the story, I thought there was going to be a lot more shady, late-night drunk texting going on. And what I found was a lot of people who felt, for example, “I just really wanted to make sure that my ex-boyfriend’s grandma, who is immunocompromised, is okay.” Or: “I just thought this would be a good time to check in and give us something to be kind to each other about and get back on a good note together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has given a lot of people cover to reach out to their exes that they maybe wouldn’t have known how to reach out to before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: What about crushes? They’re reaching out, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, a lot of the same stuff applies here. The same reasons you would reach out to an ex during this time are sometimes the same reasons you would reach out to a crush to reveal your feelings to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the obvious things is that everyone’s bored, lonely, spending a lot more time with their own thoughts. And if you had some crush that you were spending a lot of time thinking about before, you’re probably thinking about them a lot more now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook, which owns Instagram as well as WhatsApp, wrote in a blog post late last month that it had seen a spike in user engagement over all its platforms and a 50 percent increase in direct messages between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: What are people doing, asking to go for walks? You can’t go to a show or a restaurant or a bar. You could go for a distanced walk where you’re pretty far apart, but you’re walking together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: Anecdotally, I have heard of people doing that, especially if they live in the same neighborhood or in neighborhoods that are a reasonable distance apart. They walk, meet at the same street corner, and then take a walk to a less crowded street and keep six feet of distance between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: I can’t imagine a more awkward thing. People are getting desperate. There’s always Zoom, though, right? Or do people not want to conduct their business and their dating life in the same place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: I think that’s a piece of it. And when I picture doing a date via Zoom, there’s so much I don’t know about the person on the other end. How do they walk? What is it like to be near them? How do they make me feel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells&lt;/strong&gt;: In addition to terror-management theory, you also wrote about the misattribution of arousal. Can you explain what that is?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a very famous &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0037031"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on this from the ’70s. They had men either cross a rickety, old, scary bridge or a really stable bridge. Then an attractive female researcher said to them, “Here’s a quick survey. Can you tell me what’s on your mind right now? You can call me next week if you want to know more about my studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that there was much more sexual content in the recollections of the men who had crossed the scary bridge than the ones who had crossed the stable bridge. And those men were also more likely to call the researcher later and be flirtatious with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was reporting this story on why people are confessing their crushes right now, one thing that a researcher said to me is that maybe people are mistaking the terror of the world outside right now for really intense feelings for the person that they like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells&lt;/strong&gt;: All of this is taking place in the context of a strange moment for relationships and dating in general. People who are together are really together now. And people who are not with people are very alone. Can you put this in context?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: This is an unprecedented curveball for every romantic relationship. One thing I do see coming out of this is a lot of relationships, especially new ones or ones that were on the wane, will be broken by it. And some will be very quickly accelerated by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I anticipate that we’ll see a wave of coronavirus engagements or maybe even coronavirus cohabitations from people who were previously hesitant to make that kind of commitment, but who see during this time that they like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you could also very easily discover the opposite: You de facto move in with someone and hate it, so you don’t continue the relationship. I think this will clarify and catalyze a lot of decisions for a lot of couples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells&lt;/strong&gt;: Did anyone give you guidance on why moments like these expose all of our nerve endings and cause us to be more open and honest?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: I think that plays into the terror-management theory. Now is the time to seek meaning and interrogate how you really feel about things. How do you really feel about the life that you’ve lived? That’s part of what gets us to this place of unprecedented honesty with each other.&lt;/p&gt;</content><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/Text_Your_Ex/lead_960.jpg"></media:content><title type="html">Listen: Should You Text Your Ex?</title><published>2020-04-20T09:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T10:19:40-04:00</updated><summary type="html">A guide to dating realities during the pandemic</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/text-your-ex/610240/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:39-610261</id><content type="html">&lt;figure data-apple-news-hide="1"&gt;&lt;img alt="Illustration: American flag at half-mast on IV stand" height="896" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/DIS_Packer_Underlying/67d5a46f3.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Oliver Munday&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;W&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;hen the virus&lt;/span&gt; came here, it found a country with serious underlying conditions, and it exploited them ruthlessly. Chronic ills—a corrupt political class, a sclerotic bureaucracy, a heartless economy, a divided and distracted public—had gone untreated for years. We had learned to live, uncomfortably, with the symptoms. It took the scale and intimacy of a pandemic to expose their severity—to shock Americans with the recognition that we are in the high-risk category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crisis demanded a response that was swift, rational, and collective. The United States reacted instead like Pakistan or Belarus—like a country with shoddy infrastructure and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/white-house-set-fail/607960/?utm_source=feed"&gt;a dysfunctional government&lt;/a&gt; whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering. The administration squandered two irretrievable months to prepare. From the president came &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-coronavirus-threat/607825/?utm_source=feed"&gt;willful blindness, scapegoating, boasts, and lies&lt;/a&gt;. From his mouthpieces, conspiracy theories and miracle cures. A few senators and corporate executives acted quickly—not to prevent the coming disaster, but to profit from it. When a government doctor tried to warn the public of the danger, the White House took the mic and politicized the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every morning in the endless month of March, Americans woke up to find themselves citizens of a failed state. With no national plan—no coherent instructions at all—&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/america-isnt-failing-its-pandemic-testwashington-is/608026/?utm_source=feed"&gt;families, schools, and offices were left to decide on their own whether to shut down and take shelter&lt;/a&gt;. When test kits, masks, gowns, and ventilators were found to be in desperately short supply, governors pleaded for them from the White House, which stalled, then called on private enterprise, which couldn’t deliver. States and cities were forced into bidding wars that left them prey to price gouging and corporate profiteering. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/04/crafts-coronavirus-quarantine-stress-relief/609187/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Civilians took out their sewing machines&lt;/a&gt; to try to keep ill-equipped hospital workers healthy and their patients alive. Russia, Taiwan, and the United Nations sent humanitarian aid to the world’s richest power—a beggar nation in utter chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-america-constitution/608665/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Adam Chilton, Kevin Cope, Charles Crabtree, and Mila Versteeg: Red and blue America agree that now is the time to violate the Constitution&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump saw the crisis almost entirely in personal and political terms. Fearing for his reelection, he declared the coronavirus pandemic a war, and himself a wartime president. But the leader he brings to mind is Marshal Philippe Pétain, the French general who, in 1940, signed an armistice with Germany after its rout of French defenses, then formed the pro-Nazi Vichy regime. Like Pétain, Trump collaborated with the invader and abandoned his country to a prolonged disaster. And, like France in 1940, America in 2020 has stunned itself with a collapse that’s larger and deeper than one miserable leader. Some future autopsy of the pandemic might be called &lt;em&gt;Strange Defeat&lt;/em&gt;, after the historian and Resistance fighter Marc Bloch’s &lt;a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/Strange-Defeat/"&gt;contemporaneous study of the fall of France&lt;/a&gt;. Despite countless examples around the U.S. of individual courage and sacrifice, the failure is national. And it should force a question that most Americans have never had to ask: Do we trust our leaders and one another enough to summon a collective response to a mortal threat? Are we still capable of self-government?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the third major crisis of the short 21st century. The first, on September 11, 2001, came when Americans were still living mentally in the previous century, and the memory of depression, world war, and cold war remained strong. On that day, people in the rural heartland did not see New York as an alien stew of immigrants and liberals that deserved its fate, but as a great American city that had taken a hit for the whole country. Firefighters from Indiana drove 800 miles to help the rescue effort at Ground Zero. Our civic reflex was to mourn and mobilize together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan politics and terrible policies, especially the Iraq War, erased the sense of national unity and fed a bitterness toward the political class that never really faded. The second crisis, in 2008, intensified it. At the top, the financial crash could almost be considered a success. Congress passed a bipartisan bailout bill that saved the financial system. Outgoing Bush-administration officials cooperated with incoming Obama administration officials. The experts at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department used monetary and fiscal policy to prevent a second Great Depression. Leading bankers were shamed but not prosecuted; most of them kept their fortunes and some their jobs. Before long they were back in business. A Wall Street trader told me that the financial crisis had been a “speed bump.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the lasting pain was felt in the middle and at the bottom, by Americans who had taken on debt and lost their jobs, homes, and retirement savings. Many of them never recovered, and young people who came of age in the Great Recession are doomed to be poorer than their parents. Inequality—the fundamental, relentless force in American life since the late 1970s—grew worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This second crisis drove a profound wedge between Americans: between the upper and lower classes, Republicans and Democrats, metropolitan and rural people, the native-born and immigrants, ordinary Americans and their leaders. Social bonds had been under growing strain for several decades, and now they began to tear. The reforms of the Obama years, important as they were—in health care, financial regulation, green energy—had only palliative effects. The long recovery over the past decade enriched corporations and investors, lulled professionals, and left the working class further behind. The lasting effect of the slump was to increase polarization and to discredit authority, especially government’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both parties were slow to grasp how much credibility they’d lost. The coming politics was populist. Its harbinger wasn’t Barack Obama but Sarah Palin, the absurdly unready vice-presidential candidate who scorned expertise and reveled in celebrity. She was Donald Trump’s John the Baptist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/americans-are-paying-the-price-for-trumps-failures/609532/?utm_source=feed"&gt;David Frum: Americans are paying the price for Trump’s failures&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump came to power as the repudiation of the Republican establishment. But the conservative political class and the new leader soon reached an understanding. Whatever their differences on issues like trade and immigration, they shared a basic goal: to strip-mine public assets for the benefit of private interests. Republican politicians and donors who wanted government to do as little as possible for the common good could live happily with a regime that barely knew how to govern at all, and they made themselves Trump’s footmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a wanton boy throwing matches in a parched field, Trump began to immolate what was left of national civic life. He never even pretended to be president of the whole country, but pitted us against one another along lines of race, sex, religion, citizenship, education, region, and—every day of his presidency—political party. His main tool of governance was to lie. A third of the country locked itself in a hall of mirrors that it believed to be reality; a third drove itself mad with the effort to hold on to the idea of knowable truth; and a third gave up even trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump acquired a federal government crippled by years of right-wing ideological assault, politicization by both parties, and steady defunding. He set about finishing off the job and destroying the professional civil service. He drove out some of the most talented and experienced career officials, left essential positions unfilled, and installed loyalists as commissars over the cowed survivors, with one purpose: to serve his own interests. His major legislative accomplishment, one of the largest tax cuts in history, sent hundreds of billions of dollars to corporations and the rich. The beneficiaries flocked to patronize his resorts and line his reelection pockets. If lying was his means for using power, corruption was his end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-testing-rich-people/608062/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: It pays to be rich during a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the American landscape that lay open to the virus: in prosperous cities, a class of globally connected desk workers dependent on a class of precarious and invisible service workers; in the countryside, decaying communities in revolt against the modern world; on social media, mutual hatred and endless vituperation among different camps; in the economy, even with full employment, a large and growing gap between triumphant capital and beleaguered labor; in Washington, an empty government led by a con man and his intellectually bankrupt party; around the country, a mood of cynical exhaustion, with no vision of a shared identity or future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;If the pandemic&lt;/span&gt; really is a kind of war, it’s the first to be fought on this soil in a century and a half. Invasion and occupation expose a society’s fault lines, exaggerating what goes unnoticed or accepted in peacetime, clarifying essential truths, raising the smell of buried rot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus should have united Americans against a common threat. With different leadership, it might have. Instead, even as it spread from blue to red areas, attitudes broke down along familiar partisan lines. The virus also should have been a great leveler. You don’t have to be in the military or in debt to be a target—you just have to be human. But from the start, its effects have been skewed by the inequality that we’ve tolerated for so long. When tests for the virus were almost impossible to find, the wealthy and connected—the model and reality-TV host Heidi Klum, the entire roster of the Brooklyn Nets, the president’s conservative allies—&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/coronavirus-testing-elite.html"&gt;were somehow able to get tested, despite many showing no symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. The smattering of individual results did nothing to protect public health. Meanwhile, ordinary people with fevers and chills had to wait in long and possibly infectious lines, only to be turned away because they weren’t actually suffocating. An internet joke proposed that the only way to find out whether you had the virus was to sneeze in a rich person’s face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Trump was asked about this blatant unfairness, he expressed disapproval but added, “&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-5/"&gt;Perhaps that’s been the story of life&lt;/a&gt;.” Most Americans hardly register this kind of special privilege in normal times. But in the first weeks of the pandemic it sparked outrage, as if, during a general mobilization, the rich had been allowed to buy their way out of military service and hoard gas masks. As the contagion has spread, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/nyregion/coronavirus-race-deaths.html"&gt;its victims have been likely to be poor, black, and brown people&lt;/a&gt;. The gross inequality of our health-care system is evident in the sight of refrigerated trucks lined up outside public hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/race-and-blame/609946/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Ibram X. Kendi: Stop blaming black people for dying of the coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now have two categories of work: essential and nonessential. Who have the essential workers turned out to be? Mostly people in low-paying jobs that require their physical presence and put their health directly at risk: warehouse workers, shelf-stockers, Instacart shoppers, delivery drivers, municipal employees, hospital staffers, home health aides, long-haul truckers. Doctors and nurses are the pandemic’s combat heroes, but the supermarket cashier with her bottle of sanitizer and the UPS driver with his latex gloves are the supply and logistics troops who keep the frontline forces intact. In a smartphone economy that hides whole classes of human beings, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/i-work-grocery-store-dont-call-me-hero/610147/?utm_source=feed"&gt;we’re learning where our food and goods come from, who keeps us alive&lt;/a&gt;. An order of organic baby arugula on AmazonFresh is cheap and arrives overnight in part because the people who grow it, sort it, pack it, and deliver it have to keep working while sick. For most service workers, sick leave turns out to be an impossible luxury. It’s worth asking if we would accept a higher price and slower delivery so that they could stay home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="callout-placeholder" data-source="curated"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has also clarified the meaning of nonessential workers. One example is Kelly Loeffler, the Republican junior senator from Georgia, whose sole qualification for the empty seat that she was given in January is her immense wealth. Less than three weeks into the job, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/congress-insider-trading-problem/608488/?utm_source=feed"&gt;after a dire private briefing about the virus, she got even richer from the selling-off of stocks&lt;/a&gt;, then she accused Democrats of exaggerating the danger and gave her constituents false assurances that may well have gotten them killed. Loeffler’s impulses in public service are those of a dangerous parasite. A body politic that would place someone like this in high office is well advanced in decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purest embodiment of political nihilism is not Trump himself but his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. In his short lifetime, Kushner has been fraudulently promoted as both a meritocrat and a populist. He was born into a moneyed real-estate family the month Ronald Reagan entered the Oval Office, in 1981—a princeling of the second Gilded Age. Despite Jared’s mediocre academic record, he was admitted to Harvard after his father, Charles, pledged a $2.5 million donation to the university. Father helped son with $10 million in loans for a start in the family business, then Jared continued his elite education at the law and business schools of NYU, where his father had contributed $3 million. Jared repaid his father’s support with fierce loyalty when Charles was sentenced to two years in federal prison in 2005 for trying to resolve a family legal quarrel by entrapping his sister’s husband with a prostitute and videotaping the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/trump-is-the-chinese-governments-most-useful-idiot/608638/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Adam Serwer: Trump is inciting a coronavirus culture war to save himself&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jared Kushner failed as a skyscraper owner and a newspaper publisher, but he always found someone to rescue him, and his self-confidence only grew. In &lt;em&gt;American Oligarchs&lt;/em&gt;, Andrea Bernstein describes how he adopted the outlook of a risk-taking entrepreneur, a “disruptor” of the new economy. Under the influence of his mentor Rupert Murdoch, he found ways to fuse his financial, political, and journalistic pursuits. He made conflicts of interest his business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when his father-in-law became president, Kushner quickly gained power in an administration that raised amateurism, nepotism, and corruption to governing principles. As long as he busied himself with Middle East peace, his feckless meddling didn’t matter to most Americans. But since he became an influential adviser to Trump on the coronavirus pandemic, the result has been mass death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his first week on the job, in mid-March, Kushner co-authored the worst Oval Office speech in memory, interrupted the vital work of other officials, may have compromised security protocols, flirted with conflicts of interest and violations of federal law, and made fatuous promises that quickly turned to dust. “&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kushner-coronavirus-team-sparks-confusion-plaudits-inside-white-house-response-efforts/2020/03/18/02038a16-6874-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html"&gt;The federal government is not designed to solve all our problems&lt;/a&gt;,” he said, explaining how he would tap his corporate connections to create drive-through testing sites. They never materialized. He was convinced by corporate leaders that Trump should not use presidential authority to compel industries to manufacture ventilators—then Kushner’s own attempt to negotiate a deal with General Motors fell through. With no loss of faith in himself, he blamed shortages of necessary equipment and gear on incompetent state governors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To watch this pale, slim-suited dilettante &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/01/jared-kushner-coronavirus-response-160553"&gt;breeze into the middle of a deadly crisis&lt;/a&gt;, dispensing business-school jargon to cloud the massive failure of his father-in-law’s administration, is to see the collapse of a whole approach to governing. It turns out that scientific experts and other civil servants are not traitorous members of a “deep state”—&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/now-trump-needs-deep-state-fight-coronavirus/605752/?utm_source=feed"&gt;they’re essential workers&lt;/a&gt;, and marginalizing them in favor of ideologues and sycophants is a threat to the nation’s health. It turns out that “nimble” companies can’t prepare for a catastrophe or distribute lifesaving goods—&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/trump-ensuring-worst-possible-outcome-coronavirus-crisis/607867/?utm_source=feed"&gt;only a competent federal government can do that&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out that everything has a cost, and years of attacking government, squeezing it dry and draining its morale, inflict a heavy cost that the public has to pay in lives. All the programs defunded, stockpiles depleted, and plans scrapped meant that we had become a second-rate nation. Then came the virus and this strange defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/trump-coronavirus-message/610009/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Trump’s coronavirus message is revisionist history&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight to overcome the pandemic must also be a fight to recover the health of our country, and build it anew, or the hardship and grief we’re now enduring will never be redeemed. Under our current leadership, nothing will change. If 9/11 and 2008 wore out trust in the old political establishment, 2020 should kill off the idea that anti-politics is our salvation. But putting an end to this regime, so necessary and deserved, is only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re faced with a choice that the crisis makes inescapably clear. We can stay hunkered down in self-isolation, fearing and shunning one another, letting our common bond wear away to nothing. Or we can use this pause in our normal lives to pay attention to the hospital workers holding up cellphones so their patients can say goodbye to loved ones; &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-health-care-workers-plane-to-new-york-city-from-atlanta-join-covid-19-battle-hospitals/"&gt;the planeload of medical workers flying from Atlanta to help in New York&lt;/a&gt;; the aerospace workers in Massachusetts demanding that their factory be converted to ventilator production; the Floridians standing in long lines because they couldn’t get through by phone to the skeletal unemployment office; the residents of Milwaukee braving endless waits, hail, and contagion to &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/supreme-courts-hypocrisy-going-get-americans-killed/609598/?utm_source=feed"&gt;vote in an election forced on them by partisan justices&lt;/a&gt;. We can learn from these dreadful days that stupidity and injustice are lethal; that, in a democracy, being a citizen is essential work; that the alternative to solidarity is death. After we’ve come out of hiding and taken off our masks, we should not forget what it was like to be alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article appears in the June 2020 print edition with the headline “Underlying Conditions.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>George Packer</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/george-packer/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2020/04/DIS_Packer_UnderlyingHomepage/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Oliver Munday</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">We Are Living in a Failed State</title><published>2020-04-20T07:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T14:14:47-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The coronavirus didn’t break America.

Have a question? Email her at &lt;a href="mailto:dear.therapist@theatlantic.com"&gt;dear.therapist@theatlantic.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Therapist,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My older sister and I have an okay relationship. She likely had ADHD as a child, and she had aggressive outbursts that made me not want to spend time with her when we were younger. As adults, our relationship is not sisterly, because I feel like her caregiver. She has bad anxiety, and because of grad school, she developed a panic disorder that involves frequent panic attacks. She expects me to console and calm her, and I have tried, but it’s exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I’ve moved out of state, and she’s not handling the coronavirus outbreak well (who is?). She messages or calls me while I’m working at home to tell me how overwhelmed she is and how she’ll never finish her work to-do lists. I have tried to tell her to bring this up with her therapist; to not expect so much of herself during this time; to explain to her boss what she’s going through and ask for help; and to recognize that no one expects everything to be done perfectly or on time right now. But she has excuses for why none of that will work. She will message me the exact same complaints the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of our tense childhood, she takes any boundaries or silence as complete rejection of her as a person, or says that I don’t take her mental illness seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I myself haven’t seen a therapist since college, and at the time, I was diagnosed with depression. But I never addressed it. I’d like to now, but I am having a hard time making myself follow through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I tell her to limit how much she puts on me? Or should I accept that in order to help her through her mental-illness journey, this is what is required of me? How can I balance that with my own needs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anonymous&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gaithersburg, Md.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Anonymous,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are challenging times, and you, like so many, are doing your best to cope with the coronavirus outbreak. Even so, I can imagine that feeling obligated to manage your sister’s anxiety only adds to the difficulty. The good news is that living through this moment might help you see something about your relationship with your sister that was harder to see during normal times: namely, that your sister was never the only one struggling with her condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I mean is this: Mental-health conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, addiction, and schizophrenia shape the dynamics of an entire family. Sometimes the person with the condition is a parent, and this affects not only that person’s partner, but also his or her children. Other times the person with the condition is a child, and this affects the child’s parents as well as any siblings. Each family member will feel a range of emotions that might include worry, anger, helplessness, dread, or resentment, and each will respond in his or her own way. One person might try to “save” the struggling family member, another might avoid getting too close or even completely disengage, while another might stuff down her own needs and feelings in order to be “easy” and not add to the family’s collective stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/a-therapists-guide-to-emotional-health-in-a-pandemic/608161/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Dear Therapist’s guide to staying sane during a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve your relationship with your sister in the present, you’ll need to consider what role you took on in the family dynamic, because these roles tend to persist into adulthood in some form, and when this happens, the now-adult sibling gets stuck. Any of these roles may have been adaptive while growing up—a child finds a way to cope—but they constrain the person as an adult. That might be why you’re asking whether you have a right to set boundaries, a right to protect your psyche, a right to consider your own needs—in short, a right to live your life and not your sister’s life for her. The child who felt like she had no alternative (&lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; didn’t choose to live in a house with this particular sibling) grows into an adult who has trouble seeing how free she has become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see the freedom you have now, start by exploring how growing up with your sister affected you and continues to do so. For instance, when she had “aggressive outbursts,” perhaps you felt scared, or angry, or unsafe. Maybe you felt invisible or neglected if your parents paid more attention to your sister because she took up so much air in the house, and if much of their energy was spent trying to help her while also managing their own complicated feelings toward her. Maybe whatever was going on in the house left you teetering between resenting your sister and feeling responsible for her well-being. And maybe all of this led you to question, even when you were diagnosed with depression, whether you deserve to be the focus of your own attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/what-does-social-distance-mean-within-a-family/608044/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Coronavirus risk doesn’t stop at your front door&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You say that you want to address your depression now but are having a hard time following through. Do you notice how you sound a bit like your sister here? When you tell her, “Here’s what might help,” she makes excuses—just like you do when you tell yourself that seeing a therapist might help. Then you both continue to complain that nothing’s changing. And it’s not, because you’re both stuck in your childhood roles: hers as a helpless person with anxiety, yours as the helpless sister of a person with anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of shedding our family identities is that it frees us up to become who we actually are. But to get there, we have to accept some basic truths, the first of which is that this freedom comes with responsibility—we are all responsible for our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that you can’t take away another person’s mental-health condition, no matter how much you care about them. You can only offer your love and supportive suggestions (just once, not repeatedly), and it’s up to your sister what she chooses to tell her therapist, her boss, or even herself about her perceived lack of agency. It’s up to your sister to decide whether she wants to see a psychiatrist for a medication consultation, or to be kinder to herself if she doesn’t get all of her work done during a global pandemic, or to reach out to other friends for support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/how-coronavirus-caused-hug-and-handshake-hiatus/607762/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: When keeping your distance is the best way to show you care&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, it’s up to you whether you choose to say something to her like “I love you very much, and I do take your pain seriously. But I also believe that you’re very capable and strong and smart, so there’s nothing I can tell you that you don’t already know about what might help you feel better right now. I find these conversations as draining as you find your anxiety to be, and because I care about the quality of our relationship, from now on I’m going to end a call or not respond to a text when you bring this to me, because it doesn’t serve either of us.” And then it’s up to you to manage your own feelings when you disappoint her (and you will)—perhaps with the help of a therapist, or a support group for siblings of people with mental-health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strikes me most about your letter is that you describe your sister’s reaction to the coronavirus outbreak without once mentioning your own. Yes, she deserves compassion and understanding, but so do you. The more you can free yourself by becoming the adult that you are, the healthier your relationship with your sister—and yourself—will become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Therapist is for informational purposes only, does not constitute medical advice, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

It’s time to figure out better ways to live together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to call what my extended family lives in a commune. My husband, teenage daughters, and I live in a ramshackle old house. When we bought the place, a law-school student was living in a tiny house in the backyard. Soon she graduated and we bought that house too. My father-in-law was declining into dementia, so he and my mother-in-law moved in there. We helped her with his care, which wasn’t easy, because he had a tendency to wander. (Since then, he’s passed away, but my mother-in-law still lives in our backyard.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, a few years later, the house next door came on the market. My own parents were also having health problems but lived in a remote mountain community without a hospital. My brother bought the house for them, and now they live there part-time. During the summer, my brother, who is not married, lives there as well. We knocked down the fence between our homes and put down a path. This has been great for us as parents, because we always have a family member to help with child care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our forged family includes “orphaned” seniors who have moved to town to enjoy this community, old friends cut off from their own families, a homeless woman who for a time slept on my mother-in-law’s tiny kitchen floor, a former nun, a recent widower, and anyone else who doesn’t have a place to go on a holiday. My daughters grew up thinking this is normal, and in my family it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melodie Edwards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Laramie, Wyo.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Brooks writes that in primitive societies, people who migrated together formed a band. That is still true today in the U.S. I grew up in two extended families. The first was purely familial: three generations of grandparents, parents, and children plus assorted uncles all living together. But there was another extended family as well: the White Russian émigrés who fled communism. The members of that large extended family did not share a house, except in some cases, but lived close to one another and joined forces to raise children, start businesses, refer one another to jobs, build churches, and care for the elderly. The article mentions that recent immigrants to the U.S. are more likely to live in extended-kinship families; nonbiological kinship gives extra resilience to these communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lena S. Zezulin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Takoma Park, Md.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed David Brooks’s informative and insightful article on the American nuclear family, but I think he is seriously misguided by the notion that progressives lack an understanding of and commitment to conventional family structures. He writes, “Progressives have no philosophy of family life at all.” This is simply not true. That progressives are tolerant of unconventional domestic arrangements does not mean they are oblivious or indifferent to the great personal and social rewards of conventional family life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Juneau, Alaska&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks provides an accurate picture of how the family once was and how it has disintegrated. However, he leaves out the exciting formation of other kinds of ties that stretch kinship in unprecedented ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my own research on donor-sibling networks, I have found that parents and their donor-conceived children are voluntarily taking unique steps to counter the shrinking family by finding other families who happened to have purchased the same donor’s gametes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a child who had no siblings has a dozen. Moreover, these genetic relatives (who start out as strangers) are exploring what it means to be related and connected to one another. They say they feel naturally comfortable together because they share genes—and they look for resemblances and similarities that reinforce belonging to the same kinship group. As siblings, they feel a moral responsibility to one another even if they have not grown up in the same household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanna Hertz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Professor of Sociology and Women’s and Gender Studies at Wellesley College&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brookline, Mass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Q &amp;amp; A&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Brooks answers questions from readers about his March cover story on the nuclear family.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; I am curious about the choice of 1965 as the end date for the nuclear family. Can you comment more on the reason(s) for that selection? — &lt;i&gt;Nancy Barba, Portland, Maine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;I chose 1965 because that’s about the moment when divorce rates began to spike and more unmarried people started having children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: &lt;/b&gt;Is the nuclear family the problem, or is it how we’ve changed our lifestyles—or how our world has forced us to change our lifestyles? — &lt;i&gt;Ted David, Hyattsville, Md. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;Family structures change, along with lifestyle and all sorts of other social arrangements, because of an underlying shift in consciousness. Around 1965, a communal “we first” consciousness was replaced by an individualistic “me first” consciousness. That produced a range of other changes across sectors. The evidence clearly indicates, to me at least, that culture drives history even more than economics and technology do. When you get a shift in values, everything else follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: &lt;/b&gt;How can one write an article of this sort and fail to acknowledge the role that religious belief and communities have had in mitigating the fallout from family breakdown by acting as the chosen community/family? — &lt;i&gt;Alisha Ruiss, Montreal, Quebec&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;You are right to point to the importance of religion. I’ve received a lot of responses from clergy members to this article. None said they were motivated to urge their flock to return to bigger extended families. All of them said they were motivated to make their own congregation into more of a forged family. Perhaps the only way to get young people back to church is to make it the place where family happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Facts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we learned fact-checking our new podcast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/floodlines/?utm_source=feed"&gt;our new podcast &lt;i&gt;Floodlines&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Vann R. Newkirk II revisits one of the biggest questions of Hurricane Katrina: Why did the levees fail?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 80 percent of New Orleans flooded in 2005, blame fell on the Army Corps of Engineers, which built the breached levees near Lake Pontchartrain. Numerous studies—including the Corps’s own 6,000-page report—detailed the many mistakes. One conclusion, not mentioned in &lt;i&gt;Floodlines&lt;/i&gt; but uncovered while fact-checking the show, sticks out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steel sheet piles used to anchor the New Orleans floodwalls against a potential hurricane surge were driven about half as deep into the ground as they should have been. This construction error was the result of an oversight in 1985: Corps researchers had made recommendations about the sheet piles’ ideal depth based on a study in which the view of a test floodwall was partially obscured. Experts now speculate that the test floodwall—like the actual floodwalls—was slightly tilted, allowing water to seep beneath and destabilize it. What blocked their view? A tarp that had been draped over the wall and was concealing its base—and the gap that had likely formed there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shorter, shallower sheet piles reduced the price of the floodwalls by approximately $100 million—but cost hundreds of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;William Brennan&lt;/strong&gt;, Floodlines &lt;em&gt;fact-checker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Behind the May Cover&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cover-design process starts with anxious pangs: &lt;i&gt;What should we make?

These friends tell me they’re spending their day troubleshooting lessons given over videochat. When they aren’t standing over their kids’ shoulders showing them which math problem to do, they’re printing their worksheets or scanning them to send back to the teacher. It’s exhausting for parents with one kid, but with three or four, it’s practically impossible. Many of these parents have told me they’ve ended the day in tears—or spent the entire day in tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The frustrations of these moms echo those of an Israeli mother of four who recently went viral in a screaming, pleading video to teachers, recorded in her car. She told the camera, “Listen. It’s not working … this distance-learning thing. It’s impossible!” She was “falling to pieces,” she said. “If we don’t die of corona, we’ll die of distance learning … Please. Turn it down. Foot off the gas. Leave them be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It’s a fine message for teachers and administrators who are working around the clock to create ad hoc curricula with absolutely no notice. But it’s not necessary for parents to plead with teachers to ease up on the gas. Parents can, and should, simply opt out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2020/04/how-remote-school-can-work-covid-19-pandemic/609895/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What teachers need to make remote learning work&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many school districts have attempted to shift schooling to home, but you cannot simply school at home. That’s why many homeschoolers call what they do “home education,” not homeschooling. Home education involves an understanding that children can learn while doing everyday tasks; baking can teach math, science, and home economics. Sitting on the couch reading &lt;em&gt;Charlotte’s Web&lt;/em&gt; to kids in grades five and three and kindergarten counts as “school.”  So does taking a nature walk and creating a nature journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a homeschool mother, I set my own curriculum and my own schedule. We have the flexibility to plan our schedule around baby and toddler naps, my work schedule, and the activities my children once did. My kids’ education is my responsibility, and it is designed to fit our family’s individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The situation into which almost every parent in America has now suddenly and unwillingly been thrust could not be more different. One-size-fits-all education barely works in a classroom, but it is completely unmanageable with kids spread out across their various households working independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Most kids aren’t going back to school this calendar year; school districts have already conceded as much, as have many universities. Parents are in this not just for a few weeks, but for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And is this how families want to be spending the next months? Sitting inside staring at a computer screen for six hours a day? Most adults have a hard time in online meetings for that long for one day; it’s completely unreasonable to expect it of a child for months on end. And it’s leading to behavior issues, too. On one recent Facebook thread about screen time–generated outbursts, one mother wrote, “This is a major conflict in our family because we do not believe in this amount of screen time, and the kids thrive without it. Yet it is expected in order for online learning to occur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2020/04/special-education-goes-remote-covid-19-pandemic/610231/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The pandemic is a crisis for students with special needs&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Schools can still play a constructive role, even if they aren’t holding online classes for kids stuck in their homes. Instead of spending time on online lessons and hours of videochats, schools need to provide a crash course in education for parents, provide loose individual lesson plans and suggestions, and operate as a help line. When I chose home education for my children, I had the benefit of years of reading about educational theory and philosophy and best practices, in anticipation of teaching my children when they became school-age. Parents across the country have been thrown into the deep end of the pool, and they could use much more support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Parents, teachers, and administrators need to understand the unique nature of education at home. Every family looks different and has different needs. Some children have no siblings; some have many. Some children have parents who don’t speak English as a first language, but who could provide instruction much more easily in their native languages. Some families have two working parents trying to fit in school with their kids. Some families have an out-of-work parent because of the financial crisis that has resulted from this pandemic. What would be the best use of a kid’s time in the next few weeks and months? If an out-of-work restaurant chef is now home with his kids, will they gain more if he helps them do busywork problems in math, or if he teaches them how to cook?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The next few months will radically alter how parents think about the education of their children. For the time being, they are responsible for it. That’s why it’s time for parents to take charge of their kids’ schooling. Parents, not teachers or administrators, are the ones in the trenches—and so parents, not teachers or administrators, need to set the schedule and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bethany Mandel</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/bethany-mandel/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/h_15338978/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>LAM YIK FEI / The New York Times​ / Redux</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Distance Learning Isn’t Working</title><published>2020-04-20T06:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T10:17:30-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Instead of trying to move classes online, schools should support parents in educating their children.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/just-give-distance-learning/610222/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610216</id><content type="html">&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;Nowhere is the challenge posed by COVID-19 more urgent than in America’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/the-emergency-in-florida-jails/609670/?utm_source=feed"&gt;jails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/americas-innocent-prisoners-are-going-die-there/609133/?utm_source=feed"&gt;prisons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/opinion/coronavirus-ice-immigration-detention.html"&gt;immigration detention facilities&lt;/a&gt;, where hundreds of people are crowded into shared, unsanitary living spaces. Medical care is limited, and basic protective measures—social distancing, wearing masks, frequent hand-washing—are often impossible. The regular flow of new detainees, plus the coming and going of corrections staff, creates a steady risk of exposure. The government has implored Americans to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, even as it violates every single one of them in many of its own institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conditions have set the stage for disaster. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/rikers-island-jail-coronavirus-public-health-disaster"&gt;Rikers Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/coronavirus-cook-county-jail-chicago.html"&gt;Cook County Jail&lt;/a&gt;, which were swiftly and brutally overwhelmed by the virus early on, are thus a sign of things to come.

Nobody should be &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/americas-innocent-prisoners-are-going-die-there/609133/?utm_source=feed"&gt;forced to risk deadly exposure to COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; while awaiting trial or facing potential deportation, when experts have identified effective mitigation strategies: &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/03/coronavirus-jails-bail-reform-arrests/"&gt;limiting new arrests and detentions&lt;/a&gt; to those who clearly threaten public safety; requiring &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/make-soap-free-prisons/609202/?utm_source=feed"&gt;improved testing, hygiene, and isolation protocols&lt;/a&gt; in detention facilities; and &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-release-more-prison-cuomo-20200415-smib6uwwarbuvjnygbpqmn5zja-story.html"&gt;releasing as many people as possible&lt;/a&gt; who do not pose a clear risk of flight or dangerousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, jurisdictions are &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/initial-court-responses-covid-19-leave-patchwork-policies"&gt;all over in the map&lt;/a&gt; in how quickly and effectively they have &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZOs8LtiPajxjAiKDn4VwDnhng0AkDrMi/view"&gt;embraced these strategies&lt;/a&gt;. The federal government ranks &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/06/covid-19s-threat-prisons-argues-releasing-at-risk-offenders/"&gt;among the worst offenders&lt;/a&gt;; Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Justice Department have proved stingy, opaque, and often arbitrary in their response to the escalating crisis in their own detention facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not only callous and cruel; it is also unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people are charged with crimes or detained by immigration officials, they retain certain fundamental rights. Government officials cannot lock them in cells and disclaim responsibility for their fate. This reflects Americans’ shared commitment to the rule of law, belief in human dignity, and proudest national traditions. District Judge John E. Jones III expressed the point well in &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/03/31/judge-orders-immediate-release-group-people-immigration-detention-york-county-prison-new-coronavirus/5094681002/"&gt;a recent decision&lt;/a&gt;: “Our Constitution and laws apply equally to the most vulnerable among us … This is true even for those who have lost a measure of their freedom. If we are to remain the civilized society we hold ourselves out to be, it would be heartless and inhumane not to recognize [their] plight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government’s reaction to COVID-19 in jails and ICE detention facilities must follow settled legal precedent on acceptable conditions of confinement. The pandemic does not change that clear obligation. American officials must adhere to the Constitution, now more than ever, for the consequences of failure are dire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/release-ice-detainees/608536/?utm_source=feed"&gt;John Sandweg: I used to run ICE. We need to release the nonviolent detainees.&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First consider the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment"&gt;due-process clause of the Fifth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;. The Supreme Court has held that this provision &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/99-7791P.ZO"&gt;protects immigrants in ICE custody&lt;/a&gt;. The Fifth Amendment also &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-6368_7lhn.pdf"&gt;safeguards pretrial detainees&lt;/a&gt;, who have been charged with a crime but not yet tried—and who, by law and custom, must be presumed innocent. Under Fifth Amendment jurisprudence, when the government takes a person into custody, it &lt;a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/441/520/"&gt;cannot inflict punitive conditions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/509/25"&gt;affirmatively place that person in danger and then act with deliberate indifference&lt;/a&gt;, or otherwise &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/489/189"&gt;fail to provide for their basic human needs&lt;/a&gt; (including medical care and reasonable safety).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the conditions at many ICE detention facilities, as well as state and federal jails, Fifth Amendment violations are likely widespread. Simply put, the government cannot constitutionally seize and detain people, subject them to a substantial risk of exposure to COVID-19, and then insist that inaction or half measures are acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article241966876.html"&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/civil-rights-groups-sue-ice-to-force-release-of-detainees-vulnerable-to-covid-19/"&gt;filed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/coronavirus/2020/03/21/coronavirus-nj-ice-detainees-county-jails-sue-demand-release/2891489001/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.aclusandiego.org/aclu-lawsuit-demands-release-of-immigrant-detainees-vulnerable-to-covid-19-infection/"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://kywnewsradio.radio.com/articles/news/advocates-seek-release-of-jailed-immigrants-due-to-covid-19"&gt;past&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bronxdefenders.org/bronx-defenders-and-legal-aid-sue-for-immediate-release-of-clients-at-high-risk-of-covid-19-from-immigrant-detention/"&gt;weeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;—including &lt;/u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aclusocal.org/en/press-releases/aclu-sues-ice-over-conditions-adelanto-center-rife-covid-19"&gt;class-action lawsuits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;—&lt;/u&gt;have sought to force ICE to comply with that principle.

(I brought that case with &lt;a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/"&gt;Public Counsel&lt;/a&gt; and my colleagues at &lt;a href="https://www.kaplanhecker.com/"&gt;Kaplan Hecker &amp;amp; Fink LLP&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-207_d18e.pdf"&gt;paraphrase the late Justice Antonin Scalia&lt;/a&gt;, ICE’s defense “taxes the credulity of the credulous.” Its main argument is that immigrants are &lt;em&gt;safer&lt;/em&gt; in detention facilities than they were at home. This assertion defies &lt;a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/tools/assets/files/1330.pdf"&gt;common sense, expert opinion, and all available evidence&lt;/a&gt;. As the New York federal defender David Patton has remarked, “It feels a bit like arguing with the Flat Earth Society.” Even in ICE facilities that don’t yet have confirmed COVID-19 cases—which likely reflects a near-total absence of testing—the arrival of a single asymptomatic carrier could wreak &lt;a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/tools/assets/files/1328.pdf"&gt;havoc undetectable until it’s too late&lt;/a&gt;. No rational person would feel safer in an ICE detention facility than self-isolating at home with family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/ice-detainees-coronavirus-covid-19/608920/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: ‘We are like sitting ducks’&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Fifth Amendment cases against ICE are still in their early stages, many federal judges have ordered emergency relief. Some have required that bond hearings be fast-tracked; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/us-judge-orders-ice-to-say-how-many-detained-migrants-are-being-released-under-expanded-coronavirus-medical-reviews/2020/04/09/aaecf0b0-79b6-11ea-9bee-c5bf9d2e3288_story.html"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/us/coronavirus-migrant-children-detention-flores.html"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; required ICE to quickly create, implement, and report on prevention and release strategies; and still others have directed the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-27/citing-virus-judge-orders-release-of-two-men-from-california-immigrant-detention-center"&gt;immediate release of detainees&lt;/a&gt;. Another judge &lt;a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/fraihat_-_order_denying_mtd.pdf"&gt;recently certified&lt;/a&gt; a nationwide class challenging ICE’s systematic failure to uphold the Fifth Amendment in its medical care, mental health care, and disability accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These opinions affirm that the Fifth Amendment remains a vital safeguard for detainee rights, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; amid the COVID-19 pandemic. As District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. &lt;a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/tools/assets/files/1329.pdf"&gt;reasoned&lt;/a&gt;—while ordering the release of my clients in Los Angeles—“In the time of a crisis, our response to those at particularly high risk must be with compassion and not apathy. The Government cannot act with a callous disregard for the safety of our fellow human beings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the success of Fifth Amendment arguments in many ICE cases, they have thus far gotten less traction in challenges brought by pretrial detainees against their jailers. A federal judge in Chicago has &lt;a href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/federal-judge-orders-covid-19-safety-measures-for-chicago-area-inmates-a-second-detainee-dies"&gt;ordered improved protocols&lt;/a&gt; at the Cook County Jail, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., &lt;a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/district-judge-denies-request-to-release-dc-inmates-orders-better-protections-against-covid-19/2278665/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1587430827883000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNF08AyGmTPNurAagSGRGlYMtb5vnA" href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/district-judge-denies-request-to-release-dc-inmates-orders-better-protections-against-covid-19/2278665/" target="_blank"&gt;has ordered&lt;/a&gt; extensive reforms at D.C. jails, and a federal judge in Brooklyn has &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-mdc-brooklyn-test-protocol-20200414-fktlwq7b3jaxnf2cm7joyhggla-story.html"&gt;accelerated a suit&lt;/a&gt; aimed at the Metropolitan Detention Center, but other federal judges have proven reticent about granting emergency relief to those awaiting trial. In their opinions, these judges have &lt;a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/illinois/ilndce/1:2020cv02093/374996/38/"&gt;expressed anxiety&lt;/a&gt; about releasing accused criminals without a highly individualized assessment of their flight risk and dangerousness. Such a personal, fact-intensive assessment usually occurs not in constitutional lawsuits but in criminal cases as part of standard bail determinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This judicial anxiety is understandable, but it should not foreclose all relief. Where jailers violate the Constitution, courts &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txsd.1775018/gov.uscourts.txsd.1775018.40.0.pdf"&gt;can and should&lt;/a&gt; enter injunctions requiring improved safety protocols, regular public reporting, inspections by third-party experts, and, if necessary, progress toward releasing enough detainees to meet baseline constitutional standards. However difficult these judgments might be, total abdication is far more perilous. Constitutional values mean little if the country doesn’t uphold them when times are tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How the pandemic will end&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, if the Fifth Amendment proves ineffectual for pretrial detainees, they will have to rely heavily on &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment"&gt;the Sixth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; as they seek protection from the virus—in particular, the Sixth Amendment’s right to “the Assistance of Counsel” in criminal cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to overstate the importance of access to counsel for pretrial detainees. As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals &lt;a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/19-1778/19-1778-2020-03-20.pdf?ts=1584741604"&gt;recently stated&lt;/a&gt;, the “legitimacy of our criminal justice system” depends on defendants’ right to consult with legal counsel about bail hearings, plea negotiations, ongoing investigations, and trial strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since COVID-19 emerged, that has only grown more true. Speedy and public trials are &lt;a href="https://www.theusconstitution.org/blog/covid-19-endangers-not-just-public-health-but-the-constitution/"&gt;a thing of the past&lt;/a&gt;. Judges and juries are sheltering in place, even as criminal prosecutions slowly inch forward. This puts many pretrial detainees in a frighteningly precarious position. They are stuck in jails with much higher risks of exposure to COVID-19—and much less access to quality health care—but without any end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/california-scales-back-rights-defendants/609433/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Conor Friedersdorf: Even now, criminal defendants have rights&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these circumstances, access to counsel is paramount, especially for the &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/dygq4m/thousands-of-pre-trial-detainees-are-at-risk-of-coronavirus-just-because-theyre-poor"&gt;&lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/dygq4m/thousands-of-pre-trial-detainees-are-at-risk-of-coronavirus-just-because-theyre-poor"&gt; detainees&lt;/a&gt; whose age or medical conditions put them in high-risk categories. It is through defense counsel that these men and women can seek bail, temporary release, transfer, compassionate release, or other relief—and thus obtain the individualized assessment that courts have urged in Fifth Amendment cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in some jurisdictions, the same virus that endangers pretrial detainees has also sabotaged their access to counsel. This has become a &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/04/05/coronavirus-federal-prison-mdc-mcc-new-york/"&gt;full-blown crisis in New York City&lt;/a&gt;. There, the federal jails have &lt;a href="https://www.kaplanhecker.com/newsroom/nyc-prisons-rebuked-blocking-sick-inmates-phone-calls"&gt;ceased all attorney visits, fumbled in setting up limited videoconferences, and sharply limited phone access&lt;/a&gt;. As of last week, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/04/05/coronavirus-federal-prison-mdc-mcc-new-york/"&gt;nearly 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of attorney requests to speak with clients went nowhere. Things have gotten so bad that some attorneys have been forced to file bail applications without even speaking to their clients first—which puts them at a gross disadvantage in explaining why immediate release is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is untenable. The government cannot proceed with criminal cases, detain people in high-risk jails, reflexively resist calls for their release, and then restrict access to lawyers who seek to protect them from dangerous conditions. The Sixth Amendment stands against such abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, that principle is no novelty. More than a year ago, the federal defenders of New York (represented by me and my law-firm colleagues) &lt;a href="https://www.kaplanhecker.com/newsroom/defenders-group-files-lawsuit-over-deteriorating-conditions-federal-prison-brooklyn"&gt;sued the Bureau of Prisons&lt;/a&gt; for failing to protect Sixth Amendment rights at the federal jail in Brooklyn. In their suit, the federal defenders invoked a wealth of history and precedent confirming that jailers must ensure consistent access to counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late March, the Second Circuit &lt;a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/19-1778/19-1778-2020-03-20.pdf?ts=1584741604"&gt;issued a powerful decision&lt;/a&gt; allowing this case to proceed—and confirming the role of courts in ensuring “that constitutional boundaries are not transgressed by considerations of expediency.” District Judge Margo Brodie has since &lt;a href="https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/litigation/publications/loretta-lynch-s-appointment-as-mediator-in-brooklyn-prison-lawsuit-featured-in-law360?id=32219"&gt;appointed former Attorney General Loretta Lynch&lt;/a&gt; to help mediate the dispute. In these proceedings and elsewhere, the federal defenders have repeatedly raised concerns about inadequate access to counsel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, progress remains extremely limited, well short of what the Constitution requires. Whether the federal government will meet its legal obligations to those it has detained in New York City is quite uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is true throughout the nation. These are scary times for everyone, but they are especially scary for the millions of people locked in detention. As they cry out for protection from the virus, the Constitution forbids indifference and inaction. It instead requires that the government take concrete, effective measures to save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principles that the United States and its officials articulate now—and the precedents that are set through their conduct—will endure far beyond this particular crisis.

Indeed, many have. One leader goes further still. Trusted by her people to navigate this outbreak’s murky waters, without inciting or succumbing to a pandemic of the mind, one politician is less a commander in chief and more a scientist in chief: Angela Merkel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":248,"w":672,"h":264,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2520}'&gt;For weeks now, Germany’s leader has deployed her characteristic rationality, coupled with an uncharacteristic sentimentality, to guide the country through what has thus far been a relatively successful battle against COVID-19. The pandemic is proving to be the crowning challenge for a politician whose leadership style has consistently been described as analytical, unemotional, and cautious. In her quest for social and economic stability during this outbreak, Merkel enjoys several advantages: a well-respected, coordinated system of scientific and medical expertise distributed across Germany; the hard-earned trust of the public; and the undeniable fact that steady and sensible leadership is suddenly back in style. With 30 years of political experience, and facing an enormous challenge that begs calm, reasoned thinking, Merkel is at peak performance modeling the humble credibility of a scientist at work. And it seems to be paying off, both politically and scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":528,"w":672,"h":22,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2800}' data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a bis_size='{"x":85,"y":529,"w":590,"h":19,"abs_x":277,"abs_y":2801}' href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-leadership-coronavirus/610237/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: New Zealand’s prime minister may be the most effective leader on the planet&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":566,"w":672,"h":286,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2838}'&gt;Born in West Germany in 1954, Merkel was raised in a small East German town to the north of Berlin. Her father was a Lutheran pastor and a target of surveillance by East Germany’s security service, the Stasi. A brilliant student, Merkel learned early on “not to put herself in the center of things” lest she expose herself or her family to undue scrutiny, according to Stefan Kornelius, her official biographer and the foreign editor of the &lt;em bis_size='{"x":104,"y":677,"w":149,"h":19,"abs_x":296,"abs_y":2949}'&gt;Süddeutsche Zeitung&lt;/em&gt; newspaper. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Merkel, who had by then earned a doctorate in quantum chemistry, was working as a research scientist. Soon after, she left her job to join a new political group that had formed in her neighborhood, thus quietly launching her political career. She rose in German politics and, through sheer smarts and a series of well-timed tactical maneuvers, ascended in 2005 to the chancellery, the head of Germany’s federal government. Her trajectory was dramatic and uncommon—for a woman, for an East German, and for a trained scientist with no background in law or civil service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":868,"w":672,"h":110,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3140}'&gt;Why did Merkel leave what appeared to be a promising career for the uncertainty of politics? In a &lt;em bis_size='{"x":176,"y":891,"w":90,"h":19,"abs_x":368,"abs_y":3163}'&gt;New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a bis_size='{"x":267,"y":891,"w":48,"h":19,"abs_x":459,"abs_y":3163}' href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/01/quiet-german"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; of her, George Packer called the decision “the central mystery of an opaque life.” Kornelius attributes the drastic change to a realization that, as a scientist from poorer and under-resourced East Germany, she would be “outpaced” by her western peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":994,"w":672,"h":198,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3266}'&gt;Merkel has never spoken publicly about why she left science, but perhaps that is because it never really left her. Scientific thinking—her deliberate probing of each new bit of information, her cautious consultation with experts—remains integral to Merkel’s daily decision-making process and her political persona. She is undoubtedly aware that her measured, modest handling of Germany’s affairs is at least partially why she has, for almost 15 years now, enjoyed the support of a country whose historical reverence for scientific achievement and great minds (think Kant, Einstein, innumerable others) is forever balanced by an acute wariness of charismatic leaders with big ideas (think Hitler).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":1208,"w":672,"h":132,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3480}'&gt;Prior to the pandemic, Merkel’s political star had been &lt;a bis_size='{"x":493,"y":1209,"w":55,"h":19,"abs_x":685,"abs_y":3481}' href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-07/merkel-s-fading-power-laid-bare-as-german-ministers-go-rogue"&gt;waning&lt;/a&gt;. She had become known, according to Kornelius, as the chancellor “who avoided things, much less as the one who built things.” Yes, she had prevented Europe from falling apart during the financial crisis and led the continent as it grappled with the subsequent migration crisis. But of late, she had been left politically sidelined by the domestic rise of populism, the far right, the far left, and by autocratic leaders around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":1356,"w":672,"h":220,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3628}'&gt;Then came the coronavirus. Germany’s first case was &lt;a bis_size='{"x":479,"y":1357,"w":77,"h":19,"abs_x":671,"abs_y":3629}' href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2020/jan/28/coronavirus-first-death-in-beijing-as-us-issues-new-china-travel-warning-live-updates"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; on January 28, but the threat didn’t truly transform everyday life here until the middle of March. Government-mandated restrictions in Berlin were incremental but more and more disruptive. Few were bothered by the cancellation of large gatherings such as industry conferences, but when the city’s creative centers—its theaters, operas, and concert halls—closed on March 10, something essential &lt;a bis_size='{"x":313,"y":1467,"w":98,"h":19,"abs_x":505,"abs_y":3739}' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/theater/theater-streaming-online-schaubuehne-muenchner-kammerspiele.html"&gt;went missing&lt;/a&gt;. A few days later, Berlin’s notorious and celebrated nightlife scene went dark too. Pedestrians dispersed, spooked restaurant owners closed up shop or erected plexiglass barriers. The very fabric of the capital’s social and cultural life was fraying. Residents of this once-divided city were again reminded just how quickly freedom can be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":1592,"w":672,"h":88,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3864}'&gt;Merkel—for whom, as a former East German, liberty and freedom are known to be paramount—understood all too personally what the lockdown meant for her fellow citizens. On March 18, after the country had closed its schools, its economy, its way of life, she gave a rare televised &lt;a bis_size='{"x":292,"y":1659,"w":49,"h":19,"abs_x":484,"abs_y":3931}' href="https://youtu.be/F9ei40nxKDc"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; that solidified her leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":1696,"w":672,"h":220,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3968}'&gt;Facing the camera from behind a desk, with both the German and European Union flags to her side, she began on an emotional note, by conceding that “our idea of normality, of public life, social togetherness—all of this is being put to the test as never before.” She emphasized the importance of democracy and of making transparent political decisions and she insisted that any information she shared about the pandemic was based on thorough research. Then, in an astonishing &lt;a bis_size='{"x":511,"y":1807,"w":73,"h":19,"abs_x":703,"abs_y":4079}' href="https://video.bundesregierung.de/2020/03/18/a6eqjk-20200318_a-master.mp4"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; for a German leader, one she “must have considered endlessly," Kornelius told me, she made reference to her country’s darkest hour. “Since the Second World War,” Merkel said, “there has not been a challenge for our country in which action in a spirit of solidarity on our part was so important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":1696,"w":672,"h":220,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3968}' data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/underlying-conditions/610261/?utm_source=feed"&gt;George Packer: We are living in a failed state&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":1970,"w":672,"h":286,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":4242}'&gt;What stood out from the address was not so much Merkel’s medical advice, but her unusually direct appeal to the notion of social togetherness and to her own limitations as an individual and as a leader (“I firmly believe that we will pass this test if all citizens genuinely see this as their task”). Her rational assurances and her emotional appeal were crucial at a time of rising panic. While the mood isn’t quite so dark here anymore—thanks to a variety of factors, Germany appears to have dealt with the outbreak better than many other countries—Germans largely continue to heed the chancellor’s &lt;a bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2103,"w":670,"h":41,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":4375}' href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/statement-chancellor-1733322"&gt;detailed directives&lt;/a&gt;. The number of people infected by the coronavirus has increased, as it has throughout the world. But unlike in Italy, where more than 22,000 have lost their life to COVID-19, or in the United States, where the death toll has surpassed that figure and continues to rise rapidly, total deaths in Germany have been inching up from 4,000. To put this in perspective, more than twice as many New Yorkers have lost their life to the coronavirus as have individuals in all of Germany to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2272,"w":672,"h":176,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":4544}'&gt;While country-level comparative data may be &lt;a bis_size='{"x":427,"y":2273,"w":155,"h":19,"abs_x":619,"abs_y":4545}' href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/fog-pandemic/608764/?utm_source=feed"&gt;somewhat unreliable&lt;/a&gt;, and the numbers can certainly take a turn for the worse in Germany as anywhere else, experts cite a number of &lt;a bis_size='{"x":161,"y":2317,"w":114,"h":19,"abs_x":353,"abs_y":4589}' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html"&gt;possible factors&lt;/a&gt; for the country’s relatively low number of deaths: The average age of coronavirus patients has been lower here than elsewhere, which limits the risk; the number of people &lt;a bis_size='{"x":282,"y":2361,"w":43,"h":19,"abs_x":474,"abs_y":4633}' href="https://www.ft.com/content/849308f8-75bc-11ea-ad98-044200cb277f"&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt; for the virus is higher than in other countries, and cases are for the most part carefully tracked; and the public health-care system has been efficient enough to &lt;a bis_size='{"x":223,"y":2405,"w":64,"h":19,"abs_x":415,"abs_y":4677}' href="https://www.ft.com/content/d979c0e9-4806-4852-a49a-bbffa9cecfe6"&gt;ramp up&lt;/a&gt; the number of available intensive-care units to meet potential demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2464,"w":672,"h":110,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":4736}'&gt;Given her longevity, any resulting successes are at least in some degree attributable to Merkel’s leadership. The chancellor has a way of bringing “divergent interests together in compromise,” Kornelius said. Her ability to admit what she doesn’t know, and delegate decisions, has been a particularly good fit for post-war Germany’s federalized political structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2590,"w":672,"h":198,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":4862}'&gt;Merkel has relied on experts from well-funded scientific-research organizations, including public-health agencies such as the Robert Koch Institute and the country’s network of public universities. The Berlin Institute of Health, a biomedical-research institution, has, like other organizations, recently &lt;a bis_size='{"x":454,"y":2657,"w":131,"h":19,"abs_x":646,"abs_y":4929}' href="https://www.bihealth.org/en/notices/what-cells-does-the-novel-coronavirus-attack/"&gt;pivoted its efforts&lt;/a&gt; in order to study the coronavirus. Its chairman, Axel Radlach Pries, told me that Germany’s research institutions are currently working closely together to “establish nationwide systems” of research. The federal government, with Merkel at the helm, plays a convening role, recently gathering all of the country’s university medical departments into a &lt;a bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2745,"w":628,"h":41,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":5017}' href="https://www.charite.de/en/the_charite/themen/coronavirus_sars_cov_2_charite_coordinates_network_of_academic_medical_research_into_covid_19/"&gt;single coronavirus task force&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2804,"w":672,"h":264,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":5076}'&gt;When I spoke with him, Pries stressed the significance of receiving honest communication from the highest levels of leadership during the outbreak. Merkel has relied heavily, and very publicly, on the expertise of a handful of experts, including the &lt;a bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2871,"w":92,"h":19,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":5143}' href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/823865329/das-coronavirus-podcast-captivates-germany-with-scientific-info-on-the-pandemic"&gt;now famous&lt;/a&gt; Christian Drosten, the head of virology at the Charité hospital in Berlin. From the perspective of the public, Pries said, the chancellor and the virologist “are very trustworthy.” People know “that what they get from both Drosten and Angela Merkel are real and very well-considered facts” and that the two also “share information about what they &lt;em bis_size='{"x":155,"y":2959,"w":34,"h":19,"abs_x":347,"abs_y":5231}'&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; know.” Because they are “honest with respect to their information,” he said, that information is seen as credible. This honesty, at a time of widespread disinformation, Pries told me, was playing a big role in persuading Germans to largely continue to follow the rules and maintain, even now, “a very calm situation in Germany.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":3084,"w":672,"h":132,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":5356}'&gt;The virus is still far from defeated, and no one knows what challenges lie ahead for Germany, or the rest of the world. But judging by Merkel’s approach—her rigor in collating information, her honesty in stating what is not yet known, and her composure—she may someday be remembered not as Germany’s greatest scientist, but as its scientist in chief: the political leader who executed, celebrated, and personified evidence-based thinking when it mattered most.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saskia Miller</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/saskia-miller/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/DANX6P_toned/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Michael Kappeler / DPA / Alamy</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Angela Merkel’s Scientific Background Could Save Germany</title><published>2020-04-20T02:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T15:34:50-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The chancellor’s rigor in collating information, her honesty in stating what is not yet known, and her composure are paying off.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/04/angela-merkel-germany-coronavirus-pandemic/610225/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:39-609094</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the carpenter whose tools were so dull&lt;br&gt;

I have learned enough from Lofgren over the years to think it worth sharing his views. In his note, he alludes to the background of protests by the Tea Party movement soon after Barack Obama took office—and the “Brooks Brothers riot” of 2000. He has details on all these developments in his books. For those not around at the time, more context on the Brooks Brothers riot—designed to affect the recount of votes in Florida, during the Bush-versus-Gore presidential race—is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/11/15/its-insanity-how-brooks-brothers-riot-killed-recount-miami/"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for the record, today Mike Pence offered an explanation for Trump’s “LIBERATE” tweets that differs from the one Lofgren presents, below. Pence said that, far from inciting resistance, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/19/coronavirus-latest-news/#link-XJLLP7R35VA2HDLFIVDZJ7JRVY"&gt;tweets were intended to encourage governors to “safely and responsibly” reopen&lt;/a&gt; their states. Read the two interpretations, and judge which sounds more plausible to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lofgren writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you didn’t emphasize the crucial point of this whole street theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the standard prestige media presentation, the “spontaneous” protestors against COVID-19 restrictions in Michigan and elsewhere are presented thus: those salt-of-the-earth working folk, battered by economic hardship, who want their jobs back.

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="2"&gt;The all-too-convenient disturbances overwhelmingly resemble the totally-not-connected-to-the-&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;GOP Tea Party demonstrations that “spontaneously” irrupted in 2009 to stymie Obamacare, with the death panels and so forth. That particular street theater was ignited by CNBC ranter Rick Santelli and largely financed by the Koch brothers. [JF note: more background on Rick Santelli’s role in the Tea Party era &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/when-cnbc-created-the-tea-party"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="3"&gt;Street theater was pioneered by of the New Left in the 1960s, but since the Brooks Brothers riot of November 2000 it has become a mainstay of Astroturfed movements inspired by the GOP and funded by corporate moguls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="4"&gt;Trump’s encouragement of the demonstrators is even more bizarre than commonly depicted. Past examples (Lincoln, Ike in Little Rock, Kennedy in Mississippi, etc.) represented the national head of government reining in states seeking to illegally secede or deny U.S. constitutional rights to citizens. This is a unique case: the head of the national government egging on residents of the states to illegally impede their state governors from carrying out their lawful, necessary, and proper functions to maintain public safety in a health emergency. So much for “federalism” under the GOP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
...

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="6"&gt;Republican street theater, maybe even (or perhaps especially) when it threatens public safety or human decency, seems always to act like catnip to the mainstream media, who invariably trot out the well-worn tropes of “economic anxiety.” The U.S. media have done an execrable job on this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, a reader on the West Coast writes about the long-term effects of today’s elected GOP officials condoning Trump’s behavior:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with your approach of keeping a record of what we know now about Trump, partly as a way to rebut future claims of ignorance. I wonder if you also considered the following variation on this approach—namely, framing Trump’s most egregious behaviors, characteristics, and episodes, and the GOP and conservative media responses to them—as things that would NOT warrant the end of a future presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, extrapolating from the GOP and conservative media response to Trump, a future presidency should NOT be in serious jeopardy if the president fails to a) reveal their tax forms, b) divest their business or put their assets into a blind trust, and c) explicitly uses their office for personal profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the following behaviors from a future president or presidential candidate are not only not disqualifying, but they would also not warrant a serious FBI investigation: a) publicly or privately asking a foreign power to intervene in an election, b) lying about contacts with such a foreign power during a campaign, c) discussing or coordinating campaign tactics … you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By turning a blind eye to Trump’s bad behavior, the GOP and Trump's conservative supporters are implicitly establishing the criteria for ending a presidency; and what they’ve been saying, in so many words, is that Trump’s behavior and overall fitness do not warrant the end of a presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, the points above should be explicit. Americans should know the GOP’s stance on this, and we should have a national discussion about what warrants the end of a presidency...&lt;/p&gt;

But such a request would further humiliate the Soviet state, already deeply shamed by the backwardness and incompetence revealed by the accident. Instead, the Soviets resort to “biorobots”—human beings. Teams of workers will hazard the radiation that disabled machines. To save itself, the regime will sacrifice its people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought of that scene during President Donald Trump’s press conference Thursday about reopening the U.S. economy. The press conference lacked the drama of the HBO series. There was no single moment where the scheme was revealed in its enormity. Yet the intentions are becoming clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/peter-wehner-trump-presidency-over/607969/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Peter Wehner: The Trump presidency is over&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration has two plans for the next six months. It is implementing them at the same time. They reinforce each other, and each can replace the other if either fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plan A is the Chernobyl plan: trading higher human casualties in hopes of a triumph for the central state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By reopening some aspects of the U.S. economy in the next few weeks, Trump hopes to goose the stock market and restore jobs. It’s plainly impossible to return to full employment by November 2020, but Trump can hope that the &lt;em&gt;trajectory&lt;/em&gt; of the economy will matter more than the economy’s absolute level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1984, as Ronald Reagan ran for reelection, unemployment still stood at 7.2 percent. But the economy was adding jobs fast through 1984: a &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1985/02/art1full.pdf"&gt;net increase of 1.3 million&lt;/a&gt; from the year before. That’s why the Reagan ads called it “morning in America”: the sun was not yet fully risen in November 1984, but there was no mistaking that a better day lay ahead. Trump apparently hopes that by reopening now, he can make the same claim in time for his own reelection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this plan has come into view, critics have replied that the president lacks the power to reopen the American economy. Stay-in-place orders were issued by governors and mayors, not the federal government. The airlines were grounded for lack of passengers, not by presidential order. If Trump did not switch the economy off, how can he switch the economy back on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things are more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump may not have legal power to order people back to work. But he has tremendous power over the economic resources that allow most people to &lt;em&gt;stay away&lt;/em&gt; from work. The $1,200 per person signed into law March 27 will not last long. The $600-a-week federal supplement to state unemployment-insurance benefits will expire July 31. The mortgage forbearance in the March 27 law is conditional, limited, and temporary. Rent forbearance is even more conditional, limited, and temporary. Thirty-one percent of American renters &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/no-rent-was-paid-in-april-by-nearly-a-third-of-american-renters-2020-04-08?mod=mw_latestnews&amp;amp;link=sfmw_tw"&gt;paid no rent&lt;/a&gt; in the first week of April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless federal aid is extended and expanded, workers will soon be driven to return to work by economic necessity. If Trump withholds his signature, federal aid cannot be extended or expanded. So yes, Trump has a lot of power over the closing or opening of the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has another power, too. Half the states are led by Republican governors. With rare exceptions—Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, Larry Hogan in Maryland—Trump defines for those governors the limits of the politically possible. If Trump urges reopening, he gives permission to Republican governors who want to reopen fast, like Florida’s Ron DeSantis. He also puts pressure on Republican governors who would prefer to go slow, like Ohio’s Mike DeWine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reopening early will lead to higher mortality from COVID-19. How much higher? Here’s where the brutal reality of Plan A bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Trump reopening in May will be only a partial reopening. Not all backs are equally exposed to the whip of immediate necessity. Trump can readily enough impel office cleaners back to the bank towers; he will have a harder time with the bankers themselves. Administration officials speak of a “phased reopening.” But if the reopening starts in May, it will be phased not by medical advice, but by the hard grammar of wealth and poverty: poorest first, richest last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/underlying-conditions/610261/?utm_source=feed"&gt;George Packer: We are living in a failed state&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event of an early and partial reopening, the disparities can only widen. Those who can telecommute, who can shop online, or who work for health-conscious employers like public universities will be better positioned to minimize their exposure than those called back to work in factories, plants, and delivery services. The economy will be further divided along its widening class fault: those who can control their contacts with others, and those who cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not have to be this way. If the Trump administration had not bungled testing, if it were not to this day jerking and lurching in obedience to the president’s latest ego demand, we could by now begin to see the way to a safer reopening in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is, the United States will be nearly as blind in May as it was in March. The testing regime remains bottlenecked and slow. Contact tracing barely exists. The people called back to work in the next few weeks will wear masks and stand farther apart from one another. But we are nowhere near the point of promptly identifying sick workers and effectively isolating them while they remain infectious.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plans for a May return imply acceptance of significant infection and higher casualties. Pro-Trump talkers boast that they will volunteer for these risks themselves. Broadcaster Glenn Beck &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/glenn-beck-wants-seniors-to-work-even-if-we-all-get-sick.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on March 25:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would rather have my children stay home and all of us who are over 50 go in and keep this economy going and working even if we all get sick. I’d rather die than kill the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those words were spoken from Beck’s home studio. The day before, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick (also a former radio host) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/1242245135129346050"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; something similar on Fox News to Tucker Carlson, who was &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/tucker-carlson-on-how-he-brought-coronavirus-message-to-mar-a-lago"&gt;broadcasting&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; home studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My message: Let’s get back to work, let’s get back to living, let’s be smart about it, and those of us who are 70-plus, we’ll take care of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is not how the pattern of sacrifice will be felt in real life. The Trump administration still has not built an effective testing-and-tracing system, almost half a year after the president received his first formal warning about the pandemic in his daily intelligence brief on January 3.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus as Americans know it is not an equal-opportunity killer. The research arm of American Public Media &lt;a href="https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on April 17 that 27 percent of those killed by COVID-19 to date have been African American, more than twice their share of the population. Grocery workers are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/12/grocery-worker-fear-death-coronavirus/"&gt;dying&lt;/a&gt; in the dozens, at least 41 as of April 12, according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, with thousands more fallen sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the lockdown rules adopted by most states in March, coronavirus deaths per day are projected to subside to below 1,000 by May 1, from the more than 2,000 a day of mid-April. If the lockdown continues a little longer, that number could tumble to below 100 a day by mid-May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Our pandemic summer&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to look at casualties as numbers on the curve is to misunderstand what the Fox talkers and the Trump donors are telling us. The political calculus of Trump’s Plan A depends less on containing the total number of casualties than on confining the casualties to people deemed expendable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A story from South Dakota is pertinent here. The state’s governor, Kristi Noem, resisted stay-in-place orders for her low-density state. As she said, “South Dakota is not New York City.” Then the state was hit by an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/17/837530494/workers-advocate-says-south-dakota-pork-plant-delayed-action-on-coronavirus?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;outbreak&lt;/a&gt; at a Sioux Falls pork-packing plant: 634 cases among employees, plus hundreds more among those employees’ “contacts,” principally their relatives. Yet the Smithfield-plant outbreak &lt;a href="https://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/state-and-regional/noem-refuses-banning-evictions-utility-shutoffs-rejects-shelter-in-place-request/article_d05d9af8-0c1d-5809-b281-2ca4ceb41cff.html#tracking-source=home-top-story?mod=article_inline"&gt;has not changed&lt;/a&gt; Noem’s approach. The plant’s workforce, the BBC &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52311877"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, was “made up largely of immigrants and refugees from places like Myanmar, Ethiopia, Nepal, Congo and El Salvador”—not Republican voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if the calculus of Plan A is wrong? What if reopening leads to a surge in deaths that cannot be politically contained? In that case, Trump reverts to his Plan B: a culture war against Democratic governors and blue states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 16, Trump tweeted “Liberate Michigan!” in apparent support of protesters who blocked traffic around the state legislature in Lansing. To date, the great majority of Americans support the lockdown, according to &lt;a href="https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/16/most-americans-say-trump-was-too-slow-in-initial-response-to-coronavirus-threat/"&gt;polling&lt;/a&gt; by Pew. Twice as many fear that the lockdown will be ended too early than those who worry it will be ended too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of this decisive opposition to the president’s wishes, the president’s supporters are borrowing the tactics of the early Tea Party. They are protesting in aggressively obnoxious ways to entice the TV cameras to overlook their tiny numbers and fringe membership: Confederate-flag wavers, militia cosplayers, anti-vaxxers. The Lansing protesters used their cars to impede ambulances. They brandished guns on the steps of the legislature. Behave obnoxiously enough, and the television cameras will disregard your scanty numbers. The Lansing protests have been joined by even smaller protests in &lt;a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/demonstrators-gather-in-huntington-beach-to-protest-states-stay-at-home-order-and-defying-social-distancing-rules/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article241999131.html"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, each numbering fewer than 100 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/conservative-campaign-security/608986/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Lawrence Glickman: The conservative campaign against safety&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, America’s most powerful cable-news network is more than a passive victim of disinformation. As with the Tea Party a decade ago, so now with the anti-lockdown protests: Fox News acts as the co-author of the pseudo-events staged for its cameras, as in this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/existentialfish/status/1251497219628445696"&gt;fanciful graphic&lt;/a&gt; showing half the United States colored red in protest, as if the whole country were aflame rather than a few hundred oddballs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Trump, it's win-win. Either he pushes the country to trade poor people’s lives for the pursuit of economic recovery, or he gets a cable-TV culture war to distract his supporters from the troubles he himself aggravated by his own negligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s bad leadership has inflicted terrible hardship on Americans. Trump’s Plan A is to use the pain of that hardship to justify more bad leadership. His Plan B is to use the pain as a way to shift odium: &lt;em&gt;Don’t blame me, the guy who failed to prepare for the pandemic. Blame the governors who are now forced to respond to my failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tools entrusted to the administration to protect the country are being used by the administration to protect the president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-sba-paycheck-protection-program/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on April 17 that small-business-relief funds are disproportionately flowing to red states, not blue ones. In South Carolina, 56 percent of small-business applications have been approved. In Texas, 58 percent have been approved. In Utah, 66 percent have been approved. In Kentucky, 69 percent. In Kansas, 79 percent. In Nebraska, 82 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington State, however, only 44.6 percent of applications for small-business aid have been approved. In New York State, only 40.1 percent. In California, only 38.4 percent. In the District of Columbia, only 30.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From his entry into presidential politics, Trump has divided Americans into first class, second class, and third class. He has continued that politics of division into this pandemic. On Saturday, Trump &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1251585447282847744"&gt;retweeted&lt;/a&gt; an ugly insinuation that state governments were favoring Muslim Ramadan observance over Easter worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The division is more than rhetorical. It shapes who gets economic assistance, who gets aid, and now, whose deaths are acceptable in order to put the country back to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life never can be risk-free. The reopening of the economy cannot wait for the discovery and distribution of a coronavirus vaccine. The job of our political leadership is to win acceptance of risk by undertaking that the accompanying benefits be shared. Trump’s noisy attacks on the cities and states that have suffered most—and his politics-first response—send the message that he’s acting in his self-interest, not the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Trump’s Plan A and Plan B intend to turn American against American, in an ugly spirit of rancor and resentment. In pandemic as in prosperity, the Trump way is to punish opponents, reward friends; accuse victims, protect culprits; demand credit, refuse accountability; protect preferred classes and groups of Americans—and sacrifice the rest.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Frum</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/david-frum/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/RTX7E5GA/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Alexander Drago / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Trump’s Two Horrifying Plans for Dealing With the Coronavirus</title><published>2020-04-19T12:13:30-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T15:59:32-04:00</updated><summary type="html">If he can’t confine the suffering to his opponents, he is prepared to incite a culture war to distract his supporters.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/trump-trading-lives-poor-economic-growth/610264/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-609589</id><content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="738" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/ATL_posters_leadart_vertical1/30b6503e6.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;During these anxious times, we constantly check our hand computers for the latest updates, which make us still more anxious. Before technology allowed us to alarm ourselves with up-to-the-minute information, public-health messages were communicated using a fundamental graphic medium: the poster. Produced and displayed on a massive scale, these posters used a variety of cultural, political, and psychological strategies to steer public behavior with eye-catching and sometimes shocking visuals. And while today’s medium provides options via Instagram that you can print yourself, the message for fighting disease remains uncomfortably the same: Cover your mouth when coughing, stay home when you’re sick, avoid crowds, and don’t poop in the communal stream. Timeless advice, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="997" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/01_nlm_nlmuid_101447458_img-1/26fd0d643.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;When influenza hit Chicago in September 1918, the city was just beginning to implement containment measures.

The Hanna-Barbera cartoon had launched in 1969, two years after my birth, so it was precisely in my little-kid sweet spot. Much as I loved it, though, the feeble animation and repetitive plots were apparent even to the young me. Whereas characters such as Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny seemed eternal, extending far into the past and future, &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo &lt;/i&gt;felt like a show just for that particular moment, for my specific childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward 35 years or so, and to my astonishment, my children loved it just as much as I had. I probably wound up watching more &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt; episodes with my kids than I had watched &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; a kid. Evidence suggests that my experience is not unique. Scooby-Doo, believe it or not, has over the years been the subject of at least 19 TV series (on CBS, ABC, the WB, Cartoon Network, and Boomerang); more than 40 animated films; and two live-action movies in the early 2000s, the first of which grossed $275 million worldwide. A new series featuring celebrity-guest voices, &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?&lt;/i&gt;, premiered last year. And a new animated movie, &lt;i&gt;Scoob!&lt;/i&gt;, starring Zac Efron, Amanda Seyfried, and Tracy Morgan, is scheduled to be released in mid-May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which raises the obvious question: What on earth is going on? Why has &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/14/movies/film-review-if-the-saturday-morning-show-wasn-t-enough.html"&gt;described by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; film critic A. O. Scott&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 as “one of the cheapest, least original products of modern American juvenile culture”—outlasted not only such Hanna-Barbera brethren as &lt;i&gt;The Flintstones&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Yogi Bear&lt;/i&gt;, but also pretty much everything else on television? &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;’s Hank Stuever once &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/06/14/scooby-doo-theres-nothing-to-do-but-dig-it/81316e38-155d-4d27-ae21-ff89ec7dd29a/"&gt;summed up the cartoon’s message as&lt;/a&gt; “Kids should meddle, dogs are sweet, life is groovy, and if something scares you, you should confront it.” But that hardly seems enough for half a century of on-air appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The essential premise, for those not weaned on the show, is straightforward. A group of four teenagers—some of whom seem considerably older (more on this in a moment)—and a Great Dane, Scooby-Doo, drive around in a van called the Mystery Machine in search of, yes, mysteries. (The gang, like its later Hanna-Barbera cousin, &lt;i&gt;Josie and the Pussycats&lt;/i&gt;, was originally conceived as a band that would play a musical number each episode.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mystery they find almost always appears at first to be paranormal—a vindictive ghost or ghoul, a rampaging dinosaur—but is ultimately revealed as an elaborate hoax involving disguises, holograms, hidden wires, phosphorescent paint, or some combination thereof. Each time the gang unmasks the genuine villain, typically male and on the older side, he utters some variation of “And I would’ve gotten away with it if not for you meddling kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="callout-placeholder" data-source="curated"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mystery Inc. members are Fred, the blond, broad-shouldered presumptive leader of the group (who wears, implausibly, an ascot); Daphne, the fashion-conscious redhead and semi-comical damsel in distress (a stereotype that the show subverted in its later iterations); Velma, the frumpishly sweatered and bespectacled brainiac; and Shaggy, the ever-famished slacker-coward defined by his prominent slouch and chin grizzle. Scooby himself—his name was inspired by Frank Sinatra’s “dooby dooby doo” scat in “Strangers in the Night”—is inseparable from Shaggy and in many ways indistinguishable: same appetite, same poltroonery, same plot functions. Essentially split aspects of the same character, the two are not id and superego, but something closer to id and more id. A typical story line involves Daphne getting kidnapped or otherwise endangered; Fred devising a Rube Goldberg–esque, and spectacularly unsuccessful, trap to ensnare the villain; and the case being wrapped up by a blend of Velma’s smarts and Shaggy/Scooby’s bumbling good luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show owed its launch in part to complaints that Saturday-morning cartoons—including Hanna-Barbera’s &lt;i&gt;Space Ghost&lt;/i&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/13/entertainment/scooby-doo-50th-anniversary-history-trnd/index.html"&gt;were becoming too violent&lt;/a&gt;. So the producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera (along with the story writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, and the animator Iwao Takamoto) decided that their new show wouldn’t merely solve mysteries; it would demystify them altogether. As any parent knows, the surest way to comfort kids is to offer them an alternative explanation for the horrors that go bump in the night: It was the cat, or the wind, or the uncle who forgot where the guest room was. In the premiere of &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt;, “What a Night for a Knight,” the ambulatory suit of armor freaking everyone out is discovered to be Mr. Wickles, the seemingly hapless museum curator who is also (gasp!) a secret art smuggler. Case closed. Sleep tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No less an arbiter of reality than Carl Sagan hailed the show as a “public service … in which paranormal claims are systematically investigated and every case is found to be explicable in prosaic terms.” Later variations of the show tried tweaking the formula. Some featured real monsters (including a 1985 miniseries titled &lt;i&gt;The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt;, starring Vincent Price as the warlock Vincent Van Ghoul). One, &lt;i&gt;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt;, recast the gang as elementary-school-aged. And characters were regularly subtracted or added—notably Scrappy-Doo, Scooby’s pint-size and pugnacious nephew. But the show consistently returned to its core premise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that Nancy Drew and the Hardy boys had long since established the template of liberated teens outsmarting adult crooks, surely the show’s enduring success rests on more than that. Having a friendly dog involved has helped, certainly, though placing a Great Dane front and center is no guarantee of universal popularity, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2010/06/no-one-has-anything-positive-to-say-about-marmaduke/345331/?utm_source=feed"&gt;as Marmaduke fans will sadly inform you&lt;/a&gt;. A more telling clue, I think, can be found in the show’s timing. It debuted during a period of acute generational conflict and anxiety: the Vietnam/Nixon years, the “Never trust anyone over 30” years. Whether by accident or design, the makeup of the Mystery Inc. gang played perfectly into that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fundamental division has always prevailed within the group, occasionally hinted at but rarely made explicit, between Fred and Daphne on the one hand and Velma and Shaggy/Scooby on the other. The former looked and sounded older; the idea that Fred and Daphne were a couple (or an ex-couple) has been frequently suggested. And how else to account for that deepest mystery of the Scoobyverse—Fred’s fondness for his orange ascot? On some level, viewers are intended to see him as a grown-up. Daphne is a slightly more complicated case. But her maybe-relationship with Fred, her overt sexualization (her outfits, unlike Velma’s, are aggressively formfitting), and the eventual revelation that her family wealth supports Mystery Inc. clearly position her as the second quasi-adult in the group. She even has a scarf that mirrors Fred’s ascot—neckwear as a signifier of maturity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Velma, who is cited as the youngest of the gang, stands out as the quintessential TV representation of the smart, awkward teenager, right down to the glasses without which she is virtually blind. She has also been rumored for decades among fans to be gay, or at least bisexual. James Gunn, who wrote the screenplay for the 2002 live-action film, said he was “pretty sure” Velma is gay; Linda Cardellini, who played the character, described her sexuality as “a little ambiguous.” A kiss—relatively chaste—between Velma and Daphne was even shot for the film as a kind of inside joke, though it didn’t make the final cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaggy, meanwhile, has consistently been reputed to be a stoner, thanks to his slovenly look, his persistent case of the munchies, and his addiction, shared by Scooby, to a treat called “Scooby Snacks.” (The 2002 movie has fun with the stoner myth, too.) Throw in the fact that Shaggy was voiced for the better part of four decades by Casey Kasem, the DJ responsible for &lt;i&gt;American Top 40&lt;/i&gt;, and the character was a walking bundle of youth-culture signifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What better way to toy, below the surface, with the cultural tensions of the late ’60s and early ’70s? Juxtapose two borderline misfits in Velma and Shaggy—who are perhaps experimenting a little with sexuality and drugs—with two grown-up stand-ins for the more conventional sort in Fred and Daphne, and then let the offbeat characters consistently (yet all in good fun) one-up the establishment types. Even the show’s signature line, “And I would’ve gotten away with it if not for you meddling kids,” sounds like it could have been uttered by Richard Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the genius of the young mystery hunters is that they were not prisoners of their era. (In fact, they were based explicitly on characters from an earlier show, &lt;i&gt;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&lt;/i&gt;—one of the first TV series to make teenagers leading characters—in which a pre-Gilligan Bob Denver played Maynard G. Krebs, a kind of proto-Shaggy, right down to the chin scruff.) You don’t have to envision the group’s internal dialectic as the counterculture versus the establishment. The show’s longevity demonstrates that the metaphor works equally well as outsiders versus popular kids. Or, most primally, as children versus parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, over the past 50 years the &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt; characters have become almost archetypal, Joseph Campbell–worthy portraits of teenagerdom. Watch just about any ensemble teen show or movie, and you’ll find your Freds and Daphnes (often as foils or outright villains) and your Velmas and Shaggys. Perhaps no one applied this paradigm more self-consciously than the writer-director Joss Whedon in &lt;i&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/i&gt;, which winked at its predecessor by imagining a group of teen monster-fighters led by a superhero version of Daphne. Buffy and her pals even referred to themselves as the “Scoobies.” Whedon later claimed, tongue only partly in cheek, “All great fiction is &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt;-like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we watch—and our kids watch, and eventually &lt;i&gt;their &lt;/i&gt;kids will watch—four so-called teenagers and their Great Dane roam the countryside, pulling the mask off some fraudulent phantom or counterfeit creeper. They’ll be headed for your local multiplex soon enough. And fear not: They won’t ever really leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article appears in the May 2020 print edition with the headline “The Secret of &lt;/em&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;em&gt;’s Enduring Appeal.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Christopher Orr</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/christopher-orr/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2020/04/Scoobs_PM_Homepage/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>John-Paul Steele / Barcroft Media / Getty / The Atlantic</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Secret of &lt;em&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/em&gt;’s Enduring Appeal</title><published>2020-04-19T09:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-19T09:00:09-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Why on earth has the formulaic series, which debuted half a century ago, outlasted just about everything else on television?</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/05/the-secret-of-scooby-doos-enduring-appeal/609091/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610237</id><content type="html">&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":18,"w":672,"h":88,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2242}'&gt;The coronavirus pandemic may be the largest test of political leadership the world has ever witnessed.

The drama of the show was fueled by 20 contestants competing for the attention of one or the other of the two stars—sometimes swapping! Also alcohol. This spring, contestants in the unofficial third season will try to win the hearts of a pair of sisters named Bambi and Evani, who, as it happens, are simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The sisters and their suitors are all characters in The Sims 4, the latest iteration of the iconic life-simulation game. Their dating show exists only in the Sims universe. You can only “watch” it by turning on push notifications for a &lt;a href="https://everfallsims.tumblr.com/"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; run by the show’s creator. It’s not exactly reality television, but it should feature some of the same chaos and kissing and fighting that make that sort of thing worth watching. It might also be the only new dating show you can watch this summer, given that &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/reality-tv-coronavirus-cable-tlc-bravo-hgtv-1203550807/"&gt;most major reality shows&lt;/a&gt; have already &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/reality-tv-filming-coronavirus-what-shows-are-coming-back-2020-4"&gt;suspended production&lt;/a&gt; because of the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shae, the Simmer who invented the virtual version of &lt;em&gt;Double Shot&lt;/em&gt;, is a 30-year-old teacher from Arkansas. (She asked that I use only her first name out of concern for her privacy.) After Shae created Bambi and Evani, other Sims users sent her contestants to try out for the show. Shae has 30 virtual men to choose from so far, and she plans to whittle the list down to 12 or 16—more would probably crash the game, even with the modification she downloaded to get out of The Sims’s limit of eight virtual people per house. Entries are open until the end of the month, and Shae will post her first episode in the first week of May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As she prepares to host &lt;em&gt;Double Shot&lt;/em&gt;, Shae is also finishing up a Sims game of &lt;em&gt;The Bachelor&lt;/em&gt; in which one contestant really did light herself on fire and die. “I expect some things like that to happen” in the new show, she told me. “With so many Sims in one house there will probably be quite a few fights. Lots of crying. Sims cry a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A game with the possibility of accidental death is more absurd, for sure, than your average dating show on ordinary television, but that absurdity is welcome. In a world without happy hour with friends, or a night at the club, or 90 minutes of prime-time screaming and kissing, passing the time requires some creativity. Shae’s project is one of many strategies people are trying out to re-create the things they miss most about their regular lives. It’s also a sign of how weird internet culture is flourishing as normalcy dissolves. Everything is weird now. When there’s nothing else to do, why not spend the summer watching animations court each other?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the real world is bananas, you &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-01-28/the-sims-still-holds-adult-appeal-youtube-will-wright/10736904"&gt;escape into a fantasy&lt;/a&gt;. People have been using The Sims to do exactly that for two decades. The game gives players the open-ended task of maintaining a career and creating a family and watching their characters carry on with their lives, responding to basic human feelings like hunger and loneliness and saving up for their dream houses. Sims can die—the current version of the game is the first to include ghosts—but the point of the game is to enjoy a life in which you control every input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As of this January, 20 million people were &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/30/the-sims-4-has-reached-20-million-players/"&gt;playing&lt;/a&gt; The Sims 4, which came out six years ago. Patreon hosts a robust economy of custom content that can be added to the game, and the Sims community on Tumblr has long been one of the site’s largest and wildest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Tumblr, the premier home of alt-twee internet culture, is the best place to be during a pandemic. The people there already live in an imaginary world, but right now they’re pulling out all the stops. Tumblr’s data team has reported huge spikes of interest in &lt;a href="https://plotindevelopment.tumblr.com/"&gt;mermaids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tumblr.com/search/piratecore"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tumblr.com/search/cottagecore"&gt;cottages&lt;/a&gt; in the woods. &lt;a href="https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/oceancore"&gt;“Oceancore,”&lt;/a&gt; a tag for people who wish to live by the sea like the heroine of a 19th-century novel, had a 1,000 percent jump in likes during the last week of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Sims content on Tumblr more than doubled from mid-February to mid-March, largely due to a series of new creative prompts and challenges. The &lt;a href="https://sydney-simsyt.tumblr.com/post/613610959780610048"&gt;Quarantine Challenge,&lt;/a&gt; for example, requires participants to set up a new Sims game and play with only one Sim, who must wash their hands and work from home and find pen pals to sustain their social life. They are not allowed to leave the house, but they have to learn three skills. They may &lt;a href="https://w-sims.tumblr.com/post/613670732434653184/stayhome"&gt;videochat&lt;/a&gt; with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because The Sims is literally a game does not mean it is a joke. Each of the sisters in Shae’s version of &lt;em&gt;Double Shot&lt;/em&gt; has a complicated backstory and carefully calibrated personality. Bambi is 24 years old and a musician who “flirts like hell” and “doesn’t let anyone tell her what to do.” Evani is 26 years old and a journalist who loves facts and the truth and playing hard to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Anyone who wants to submit a Sim to compete for one of their hearts has to send Shae a file of their character, which she can then put into her game and manipulate as she sees fit. Once the virtual men are in the game, they’ll react to whatever she throws at them based on their preset skills and character traits. The Sims will participate in challenges and group dates, just like in other reality-TV shows, and they’ll be eliminated week by week. (Time passes roughly normally in the game, although it speeds up if everyone is sleeping.) The romance should develop organically between the preset characters, and so should the infighting. “I want to bring some Sims into the game that will clash and bash heads, because that causes drama and drama is fun to watch in reality TV,” Shae told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Shae will make “episodes” by observing what happens in the game and then writing it up with her own commentary. She’ll also use a game modification that lets a user pose their Sims and take a still picture. Then she’ll edit them in Photoshop to suit her aesthetic and post the results to Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I mentioned to everybody beforehand, any posed shots will just be an amplification of what happened in the house,” she said. “I’m not posting any Sims that are hugging and kissing if they’re not actually doing it in-game.” (On that note, her blog also warns that the show will include “adult content.” As in: “There will be some language, there will be some drinking, there might be some sexy times.”) Much like a typical reality show, this one will have a producer curating the shots and steering the action—nothing is entirely real, but nor is it entirely fake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bambi and Evani have an impressively diverse roster of matches to choose from so far, including &lt;a href="https://everfallsims.tumblr.com/post/614574777937641472/shleepysims-miles-rossi-for-everfallsims-s"&gt;a cop named Miles&lt;/a&gt; who is a self-described great cook and “sympathy puker”; a &lt;a href="https://yun-sims.tumblr.com/post/614665729734819840/lincoln-drew-for-everfallsims-double-shot-at"&gt;marketing manager named Lincoln&lt;/a&gt; who loves eggs Benedict and freckles; and a &lt;a href="https://everfallsims.tumblr.com/post/614573362167021568"&gt;single father named Cameron&lt;/a&gt; whose character description says he “had a scholarship to play e-sports at &lt;a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Foxbury_Institute"&gt;Foxbury Institute&lt;/a&gt; [an in-game Sims university], but gave it all up to become a chef.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Erin Guest, a 41-year-old from Melbourne, Australia, entered &lt;a href="https://everfallsims.tumblr.com/post/614763369775382528/renlishsims-an-entrant-to"&gt;an art-gallery curator&lt;/a&gt; named George. Lexi Stine, a 22-year-old from Pennsylvania, hoped to give her contestant an edge by suggesting that he might have already seen Bambi from afar at a musical performance. “I think my Sim”—&lt;a href="https://everfallsims.tumblr.com/post/614435793022435328/valocity-its-3am-and-i-made-a-sim-for"&gt;a music producer named Zander&lt;/a&gt;—“has a really good chance, since he thinks it’s ‘destiny’ for him to be with her,” she told me. Janel Johnson, a 24-year-old from Maryland, made &lt;a href="https://everfallsims.tumblr.com/post/614865378417442816/missmoodring-morgan-hudgens-for-everfallsimss"&gt;a barista named Morgan&lt;/a&gt; to enter into the game. She’s trying not to get her hopes up about Morgan’s chances so she doesn’t feel too disappointed if he gets kicked off. “In the end all I want is for the bachelorettes to find a happy ending,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It’s all very romantic, of course. People have been created out of thin air to fall in love with each other for no reason, except entertaining those of us who can’t really go around kissing strangers at the moment. “I’ve always been a big romantic,” Shae said. “I love reading romance novels. I love romance movies.” She’s been playing The Sims since it was first released 20 years ago. “Doing a love challenge like this brings something new to the game that I didn’t know I could do before,” she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Though The Sims is a game designed to be played in solitude, having a showrunner like Shae makes it into a shared project for too-solitary times. Strangers on the internet are trusting that she’ll use their characters to come up with something enjoyable to watch, and they’ll stick around to talk about it as it unfurls. They’re invested in how it turns out not just because they are competitive, but because, in a moment of near-total romantic standstill in the real world, the kind of voyeurism promised by dating shows becomes even more compelling. Nobody is going on dates or indulging in reckless behavior right now—not even the people who normally get paid to do so on national television. In a twist, The Sims is now a way to playact not just an alternate life, but any life at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kaitlyn Tiffany</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/kaitlyn-tiffany/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/tumblr_fd91243b6130ec8daf28994bc6b50a3c_57d9a5d2_1280/lead_960.png"><media:credit>everfallsims / Tumblr</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The World Where &lt;em&gt;The Bachelor &lt;/em&gt;Will Never Stop Airing</title><published>2020-04-19T07:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-19T11:02:15-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Reality TV won’t be filming for the foreseeable future—except in The Sims.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/sims-bachelor-dating-show-simulation-game/610048/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610243</id><content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="An illustration of a hand holding up a bar graph." height="488" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/TheAtlantic_Covid19_R1_V3_01/cd8cfc3fa.jpg" width="480"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Anthony Gerace&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the past few weeks the United States has witnessed an unprecedented spike in jobless claims that has overwhelmed state agencies. Alongside a health crisis and an economic crisis, we are now entering into a devastating period of mass unemployment, one that—&lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043237"&gt;decades of research&lt;/a&gt; tell us—will leave deep financial and psychological scars for the workers and families trapped within it. Today, Americans across party lines recognize the need to act quickly to minimize this harm, but that bipartisan support will soon fade, as it has in past recessions. If Congress and state governments are going to pass forward-thinking legislation to help unemployed and precariously employed workers, now is the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Having researched the experiences of unemployed workers over the past &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/sociology/users/osharone"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://victortanchen.com/"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, we expect that the coming unemployment crisis will have two distinct phases. In the first phase, the country will largely respond with a sense of solidarity and compassion for the millions who have lost their jobs. Americans will recognize that external forces—the coronavirus and government policies to create social distance—have triggered these mass layoffs, and they will see the plight of unemployed workers in that light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Those who lose their jobs will struggle to make ends meet in a stand-still economy, but they will at least be spared some of the blame leveled against the jobless in other economic downturns. When more than 20 million people file for unemployment in a month, even the hard-hearted will have trouble &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/sunday/deaths-despair-poverty.html"&gt;casting them&lt;/a&gt; as idlers or parasites. As a result, there should be sufficient political will to continue generous government support—perhaps even expanding upon the $2 trillion stimulus package that Congress recently passed, which dramatically boosts unemployment benefits and extends them to gig workers and other people who normally don’t qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/the-us-should-just-write-checksbut-wont/609637/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Mehrsa Baradaran: The U.S. should just send checks—but won’t&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Eventually, the outbreak will subside, and economic conditions will improve. Yet, for workers who remain unemployed, the situation will worsen. We are likely to see a repeat of the unemployment crisis of the Great Recession—but the underlying dynamics will be amplified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During this second phase, companies will begin to rehire workers. If the past is any guide, many employers will use this opportunity to replace some of their former workers with cheaper and more contingent labor. During normal economic times, slashing wages or stripping away job security prompts a backlash of protest and bad publicity. But lowering such labor costs is easy when the economy is stalled and workers are grateful for any opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;More broadly, the crisis will accelerate some &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/01/white-working-class-poverty/424341/?utm_source=feed"&gt;long-running market trends&lt;/a&gt; toward industry consolidation (which reduces one’s choice of potential employers), automation (in which machines replace human labor), and worker precarity (which happens when the convenience of employers and customers entirely overrides the well-being of individual workers). Even with the payroll subsidies that the stimulus legislation provides to small businesses, the prolonged shutdown will likely destroy many mom-and-pop businesses that have already suffered from decades of brutal competition with the likes of Walmart and Amazon. One thing that kept service jobs from being automated was the sense that customers prefer human interaction, but social distancing has enhanced the appeal of self-service kiosks—and even delivery drones. Once the pandemic subsides, people may go back to their old habits, but corporations do not typically let such opportunities for cutting costs go to waste—as we have seen whenever efforts to organize workers prompt employers to suddenly bring in more computers and robots, outsource work to contractors, or move jobs entirely offshore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Given how employers are likely to act in response to the economic downturn, many of those now laid off may well remain unemployed for a prolonged period. In particular, companies eager to hold down payroll costs will hesitate to hire back &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/business/economy/out-of-work-out-of-benefits-and-running-out-of-options.html"&gt;older and more experienced workers&lt;/a&gt;. They are likely to be left behind and remain in a jobless limbo long after the economy has picked up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/were-replicating-mistakes-2008/609586/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Jesse Eisinger: We’re replicating the mistakes of 2008&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Meanwhile, the old stigmas against unemployed workers will resurface, as memories of the initial crisis fade and people &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/10/extreme-meritocracy/505358/?utm_source=feed"&gt;find new reasons to fault&lt;/a&gt; others for not pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. Even today, we see hints of what is to come. Some of the country’s most prominent conservative ideologues are already &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/489665-hannity-challenges-mnuchin-on-coronavirus-bill-expanding-unemployment-benefits"&gt;complaining about&lt;/a&gt; how Congress’s top-up of unemployment benefits encourages people to drop out of the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This resentment will become much more widespread and pernicious. Here, again, history is instructive. Even during the Great Depression, a global economic catastrophe that catapulted the U.S. unemployment rate to &lt;a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.7.2.41"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1948/article/pdf/labor-force-employment-and-unemployment-1929-39-estimating-methods.pdf"&gt;25 percent&lt;/a&gt;, resentment grew as the doldrums persisted. As the sociologists Katherine Newman and Elisabeth Jacobs &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Who_Cares/kqsXENFHzkQC?hl=en"&gt;have noted&lt;/a&gt;, critics of the Roosevelt administration excoriated the long-term unemployed as malingerers and reprobates and assailed New Deal programs as socialist schemes to tax the middle class into poverty. Eight decades later, a Wall Street–led financial contagion pushed the unemployment rate to 10 percent. This time, the &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Strangers_in_Their_Own_Land.html?id=86v0CwAAQBAJ"&gt;rancor coalesced&lt;/a&gt; more quickly, fed by a steady drumbeat of rage from cable news, talk radio, and, eventually, the Tea Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During the second phase of the coronavirus recession, America’s temporarily strengthened social safety net will revert to its &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/forget-denmark-emulate-canada/410947/?utm_source=feed"&gt;usual bare-bones form&lt;/a&gt;. Somehow, no money will be available to help the long-term unemployed—even though, just three years ago, Congress found more than enough to pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefited the wealthiest Americans. As their unemployment benefits expire, the jobless and their families will face financial collapse. Public outpourings of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/spiritual-crisis-modern-economy/511067/?utm_source=feed"&gt;compassion and grace&lt;/a&gt; will be steadily replaced, as they were in past downturns, with moralizing anger pumped up by partisan media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Swift action from Congress could prevent the coming disaster. First, lawmakers would need to make permanent the temporary upgrades that Congress made to our &lt;a href="https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2016/04/26/the-pain-behind-the-pennsylvania-primary/ideas/nexus/"&gt;antiquated unemployment-insurance system&lt;/a&gt;, which raised benefits so that families don’t sink rapidly into poverty and extended those benefits to gig workers. But beyond helping the unemployed, Congress must also revamp our regulatory system and safety net to better shield our growing workforce of &lt;a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/adulting-while-poor-millenial-homeownership"&gt;underemployed workers&lt;/a&gt;—not just &lt;a href="https://inthefray.org/2016/08/a-minimum-of-dignity-fight-for-15-minimum-wage/"&gt;low-wage workers&lt;/a&gt;, but also the broader group of freelancers, temps, and &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Fissured_Workplace.html?id=k4_zAgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;source=kp_book_description"&gt;subcontractors&lt;/a&gt; who have few legal protections and tend to be the first to go when the economy sputters. &lt;a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/meritocracys-casualties"&gt;Severe income inequality&lt;/a&gt; means that even employed Americans often live paycheck to paycheck, with no savings to get them through the next emergency. A just-in-time economy, it turns out, has no real margin for error. Tying health insurance to employment is unusually harmful to workers amid a health crisis that provokes mass joblessness while requiring widespread virus testing and intensive care. If the threats posed by longer-term trends like automation were not reason enough, the present unemployment shock has enhanced the appeal of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/08/marriage-rates-education/536913/?utm_source=feed"&gt;benefits not linked to work&lt;/a&gt;—including a universal basic income.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/millennials-are-new-lost-generation/609832/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Annie Lowrey: Millennials don’t stand a chance&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Policies that provide only temporary relief are insufficient to protect American workers from all the forces arrayed against them. The structural barriers to securing a decent livelihood in this economy will not suddenly disappear when a vaccine is found. The coronavirus has highlighted vulnerabilities in our current system that will far outlast the pain it has unleashed—and the solidarity it has instilled, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Tan Chen</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/victor-chen/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><author><name>Ofer Sharone</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ofer-sharone/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/TheAtlantic_Covid19_FINAL_16x9/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Anthony Gerace</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Second Phase of Unemployment Will Be Harsher</title><published>2020-04-19T06:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-19T08:50:18-04:00</updated><summary type="html">For American workers displaced by recession, widespread public sympathy soon gives way to moralizing anger.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/americas-compassion-for-the-unemployed-wont-last/610243/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610207</id><content type="html">&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;S&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;pring break typically&lt;/span&gt; marks the start of tourist season in Marfa, Texas, when the streets fill with families from Dallas and handsome Los Angeles couples. College kids host late-night parties in Airbnbs. Influencers pose in front of crumbling adobe ruins. And every few weeks, we get a celebrity sighting: Guy Fieri riding a bike down the potholed streets, or Matthew McConaughey hunkering down to complete his book of poetry. A few years ago, a friendly street cat brushed up against Heidi Klum’s ankles at dinner, and a few days later, it was on her private plane, heading to its new home in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until a month ago, complaining about the tourists was a low-stakes bonding activity around town. We grumbled about how they stood in the middle of the road taking pictures and how they wore bathrobes in public, as if they saw the whole town as an all-inclusive resort. (Maybe that cat really wasn’t a stray after all.) Even the tourists resented the tourists. “I was here during spring break two years ago and it was kind of disgusting,” a visitor from Los Angeles told me last year. “I just didn’t want there to be too many people like &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; here,” his friend added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the streets are empty, as they are everywhere. But when the tourists disappeared, so did most of the service-industry jobs, which has been financially disastrous for some locals. Still, not everyone is unhappy with the situation: “I was out in town yesterday and noticed how quiet and calm it was, and couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief to feel that old feeling of what Marfa used to feel like before all the tourists and craziness of random people walking around,” PJ Serrano posted on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Our pandemic summer&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I moved to Marfa eight years ago. In the finicky taxonomy of tourist towns, that makes me a transplant—not a native or a local, but not a visitor either. I did what I could to immerse myself in the community, joining the volunteer fire department, delivering lunches for Meals on Wheels. Still, I’m aware that my roots here are shallow. I may live here, but I’m not &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; here. That tension was mostly tolerable until the coronavirus—and the fear of the coronavirus—amplified these fraught insider-outsider dynamics. Now I sit in my house and wonder: What does it mean to belong somewhere? And how much pressure can you put on a community before it starts to fracture?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;S&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;mall towns are&lt;/span&gt; hotbeds for gossip. Now that we can’t gather at the bars, we exchange what snippets we can at the post office, on Facebook, and on socially distant walks by the railroad tracks. Our friends who work in the grocery stores are the best sources. They know who bought 18 rolls of toilet paper. They keep tabs on the unfamiliar faces that are still showing up. “There are definitely people hiding out here,” a cashier told me last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Marfa, as elsewhere, the crisis has inspired &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/marfa-steps-up-service-worker-relief-fund?fbclid=IwAR05KHL0KeJobdR52SgglkYtoerblkYLvKFnlAqKJqHLw23gxx1RrfB-ogI"&gt;grassroots mutual aid&lt;/a&gt;, but also a creeping mistrust. The other day, from across the fence, my neighbor told me that he was busy filling shotgun shells with salt—he doesn’t want to maim anyone, but he figures he might need them to intimidate. Last week, the county sheriff announced on Facebook that three people would be flying into our tiny municipal airport from New Jersey on a private plane. The post didn’t make this clear, but one was a full-time resident who’s lived here for decades; the other passengers were long-standing second-home owners. The group had been trying to get to Marfa from New York City for more than a week, but no cars were available to rent, and all the commercial flights had been canceled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information was not received well among Marfa’s permanent residents: “This could wipe out the entire population of Marfa.” “Why were they in NJ if they are ‘from Marfa’?” “How long have they been in NJ?” The original post listed the three people’s home addresses. One commenter threatened to keep watch with a shotgun to make sure they stayed inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a city-council meeting, the mayor suggested putting limits on what nonlocals could buy to prevent resources from dwindling. But how can we define who counts as local, a council member asked? “You know,&lt;em&gt; local&lt;/em&gt;,” someone else said. “It’s a small enough town. I think we all know.” I felt a twinge of unease; my driver’s license may identify me as a resident, but did that really count?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resolution didn’t pass, but it pointed to the darkening mood around town. When a case of COVID-19 was confirmed across the border, in Ojinaga, Mexico, some people began to argue that the border should be shut down completely. A local property owner posted an advertisement for his rentals, encouraging people to “escape to Marfa during COVID-19”; in response, the city council banned rentals—short- or long-term—to nonresidents. The stores were for the most part fully stocked, and there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the entire Big Bend region, but the feeling of imminent scarcity persisted. Never mind the local developer whose construction crews were still working in close proximity to one another, or the pointed lack of social distancing at the hardware store, or the governor’s slowness in issuing a stay-at-home order—the threat came from outside, and you could spot it by its out-of-state license plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-unique-threat-south-young-people/609241/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The coronavirus’s unique threat to the South&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic brought these bad vibes to the surface, but their roots predate the current crisis. Highly touristed rural areas are often treated as not quite real by the vacationers and second-home owners who flock to them, as Anne Helen Petersen &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/coronavirus-covid-cities-second-homes-rural-small-towns"&gt;wrote for &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/coronavirus-covid-cities-second-homes-rural-small-towns"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Marfa is described by visitors as an escape, an oasis, a retreat. Seen through a vacationer’s eyes, it’s a place without politics and problems—it’s also a place without ventilators. There’s no hospital in the entire county, which is larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined. You wouldn’t know it from the travel-magazine write-ups, but Marfa’s population is older, poorer, and in worse health than most Americans; it’s also a majority-Latino community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, when I moved here, Marfa had one coffee shop, one liquor store, one gym, and two bars. Although income inequality was a persistent issue, we at least had a shared context. In the past several years, though, galloping gentrification has spawned a parallel set of businesses catering to tourists and transplants: first a fancy coffee shop, then a fancy gym, a wine bar, another fancy coffee shop. Slowly, these businesses have begun to crowd out those catering to locals. Marfa has transformed into a town where you can purchase a $15 cocktail but not spark plugs. The second-home and short-term-rental market drove real-estate prices up so high that it is practically impossible to buy a Marfa house if you make Marfa wages. These are the preexisting conditions, as it were, that underlie the current atmosphere of fear and anxiety. Maybe it doesn’t feel as though we’re all in this together because it hasn’t felt like that for a while. Waiting out the pandemic 2,000 miles from where I was born, I feel a heightened awareness of the overlapping, contradictory roles I play in my adopted community: gentrifier, taxpayer, transplant, neighbor, friend, stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, I spoke with a woman who lives full-time on Block Island, a popular vacation spot off the coast of Rhode Island. When the second-home owners started flocking in, things got tense on the island, she said—someone threatened to blow up a transformer to keep nonlocals away. She knew things were &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;bad when her friends stopped waving to passing cars, a tried-and-true small-town tradition. Her story gave me some hope; in Marfa, at least, we’re still waving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I don’t spend time on Facebook, things feel less dire. Like everyone else, my pandemic fantasies are mundane. I think about July, when everyone’s peach trees will explode with fruit all at once, and I think about the box filled with surplus fruit in city hall. In my daydream Marfa, there are some tourists, but not too many, and when I go to pay my utility bill in person, I fill up my bag with peaches and leave some zucchini behind. The room is full of people, some who’ve lived here a year, some who’ve lived here their whole life. We smile at one another.

When the airliner was shot down near Tehran, tensions were high. Iran had struck an American base in response to the U.S. killing of the Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani. Nervous Iranian anti-aircraft crews expected retaliation, and the gunner in question likely thought he was shooting down a military target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The incident marked the fourth time a radar-guided SAM destroyed a civilian airliner by mistake. Such accidents have already killed 842 people, and as SAMs proliferate, further tragedies may be in store. These so-called smart weapons aren’t smart enough. But with some relatively straightforward changes, the fourth accidental shoot-down of a passenger jet could also be the last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Almost all civilian aircraft have transponders that broadcast a signal showing altitude and speed. Just the fact that an object in the sky is reporting such information almost always means that the object is civilian, since attack aircraft and incoming ordinance do not announce themselves electronically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/iran-shot-down-hopes-its-people/605158/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Suzanne Maloney: Iran’s Leaders Have a Problem They Can’t Fix&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Most airliners also send a message called Mode C, which is digital-speak for “I am civilian.” On top of that, new transponders broadcast substantial detail about the flight—a rich data stream called ADS-B—that no attacker would volunteer. As of 2020, American airliners must have ADS-B, while most other nations are in the process of requiring this addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Too many contemporary precision missiles are smart only in the sense of finding a target. The targeting technology of beyond-visual-range SAMs, such as the U.S. Patriot or the Russian Tor used by Iran, has gotten notably better in the past few decades. That is, if better is the word for longer range and near-perfect accuracy to destroy anything hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yet these technological advancements don’t mean that long-range SAMs have details about what they are targeting. The screens used by the missile operators may not show civilian identification signals. When a target is too far away to view, the gunner may see only a radar reflection—a target blip. Is this a planeload of tourists? The first wave of a surprise attack? The gunner may have to guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If SAM systems were designed—or for those already in use, retrofitted—to receive and identify civilian Mode C and ADS-B signals, gunners would be able to distinguish between civilian and military planes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The screens in front of missile operators could clearly identify civilian aircraft and warn against firing at them, and missile launch mechanisms could require authentication codes before accepting a civilian blip as a target. Some of these advancements are available, just not widely in use yet. The Polish arms manufacturer Mesko, for example, is already working on a SAM that requires an authentication code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Improving the ability of missile gunners to understand what the target is would not eliminate deliberate atrocity, but the innovation would go a long way in preventing mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap" dir="ltr"&gt;In 1988, a U.S. Navy cruiser in the Persian Gulf called the Vincennes shot a long-range SAM at Iran Air Flight 655, a scheduled passenger flight. U.S. and Iranian warships had recently been firing at each other. &lt;a href="https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/about-us/leadership/director/directors-corner/h-grams/h-gram-020/h-020-1-uss-vincennes-tragedy--.html"&gt;Investigators found&lt;/a&gt; that personnel in the ship’s windowless combat information center (CIC) had confused radar reflections from the jetliner, an Airbus, with signals from an Iranian military aircraft that was not approaching but was in the same general direction as the passenger flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Displays in 1988 did not show the tactical officers the difference between blips representing civilian aircraft and those representing threats. This became the first accident involving a modern long-range SAM. Two-hundred and ninety people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Recently, I was on the USS Wasp, a huge American warship. The CIC looked like any other: a windowless, boxy room with a mess of screens, buttons, and joysticks in low ambient light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Electronics on the Wasp and other Navy vessels can now distinguish between civilian and military aerial targets. That is, the ships already have what an international convention might require of all long-range radar-guided missiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There was a lot of soul-searching after the Vincennes incident, a lot of determination this won’t happen again,” says Greg Baker, the captain of the Wasp. The Vincennes killed civilians by mistake; since then, the Navy’s sensor systems have been significantly improved. For example, screens now make civilian aircraft appear visually different from possible hostiles, the innovation that all gunners should have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/01/what-iranian-way-war-looks-like/604438/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The Blueprint Iran Could Follow After Soleimani’s Death&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Other military divisions are also making these technological improvements. In February, the Pentagon began installing the Patriot SAM, operated by the Army, in Iraq. William Sharp, a spokesperson for the Army, told me that the ability to display the Mode C “I am a civilian” transponder signal has been added to Patriot batteries. The missiles’ fire-director software is programmed to “interrogate” any target by sending pings that ask friendly military aircraft to respond with an identification code, while requesting civilian aircraft to respond on Mode C. If the latter happens, the Patriot system marks the radar reflection as civilian. Various protocols make it unlikely, though not impossible, that an attacker could trick the Patriot, or Navy SAMs, into thinking it was civilian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap" dir="ltr"&gt;This new technology goes a long way in preventing mistakes, but cooperation at a higher level is needed. Governments should collaborate on an international initiative to require that radar-guided SAMs, and the similar class of anti-ship missiles, incorporate improved technology for sensing and recognizing civilian signals. Any convention should also include non-technological guidelines, such as notices to pilots who are in a war zone, that would help prevent accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One possible model for a pact is the1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which regulates the use of land mines and blinding lasers, among other threats to noncombatants. The agreement is not ironclad. Donald Trump recently&lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2071692/landmine-policy/"&gt; said the United States would&lt;/a&gt; no longer abide by certain restrictions on land mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Nevertheless, the convention is considered a success, as land mines have declined since most nations declared they would renounce such weapons.&lt;a href="http://the-monitor.org/en-gb/home.aspx"&gt; Forty-one of the 50 nations&lt;/a&gt; that a generation ago manufactured land mines have stopped producing them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;More informal diplomacy concerning conventional weapons has also been successful and provides a way forward for international cooperation on SAM technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 2002, terrorists near an airport in Mombasa, Kenya, tried to use shoulder-fired rockets called MANPADS to shoot down a civilian airliner. These weapons are easy to hide and relatively inexpensive. “There was a clear sense the situation was out of control and that no nation would benefit, only terrorists,” Matthew Schroeder, a senior researcher for Small Arms Survey, which tracks battlefield armaments, says of MANPADS. So organizations came up with regional agreements “unprecedented in specificity and scope.” Schroeder believes that these pacts reduced the problem considerably. For instance, Russia no longer markets the easily hidden bazooka-style rocket, offering only a mounted version that cannot be removed from a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Because the MANPADS agreements are regional compacts administered by little-known organizations such as the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, the conventions on these small anti-aircraft rockets failed to draw attention. Yet a&lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR4300/RR4304/RAND_RR4304.pdf"&gt; 2019 Rand Corporation study&lt;/a&gt; found that since about 2000, attempts to hit airliners with small heat-seeking weapons have declined dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/trump-is-no-closer-to-solving-americas-iran-problem/604630/?utm_source=feed"&gt;David Graham: Trump Is No Closer to Solving America’s Iran Problem&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These agreements involving land mines and small rockets show that international conventions actually can produce positive results. Because long-range radar-guided missiles are made only by large professional militaries, the United States, Russia, and China would need to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There would be a lot of pushback against an agreement that allowed inspectors to look at the details of American, Russian, or Chinese weapons-sensor technology,” cautions Steven Pifer of Stanford, a former State Department arms-control specialist. But even if an agreement were strictly declaratory, reform momentum would be created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap" dir="ltr"&gt;The details of the tragedy in Iran earlier this year show that the accident could have been avoided if technological and diplomatic agreements had been in place. A notice to airmen was not issued; this would have closed airspace around Tehran to civilian planes. Pilots of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 took off unaware that Iran expected an air battle. Screens watched by Iranian gunners did not show that the passenger flight was announcing altitude and speed on a civilian frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A campaign to make anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles less dangerous would not seek to ban such weapons. Rather, it would accept that nations arm for war, and ask only that armaments become less likely to take life by mistake. Winston Churchill once commented on the problem of military weapons killing civilians: “Are we beasts?” Let’s prove that we are not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gregg Easterbrook</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/gregg-easterbrook/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/RTS2NE1V/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Smart Weapons Need to Be Smarter</title><published>2020-04-19T06:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-19T12:18:12-04:00</updated><summary type="html">No missiles should shoot down civilian airliners by mistake.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/smart-weapons-need-be-smarter/609472/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610204</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Around the country, Jewish communities have all but shut down, closing synagogues, canceling Passover seders, conducting funerals by Zoom. Yet one kind of Jewish public space has remained mostly open: mikvahs, or pools used for ritual immersions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each month, when they get their period, some Jewish women observe a time of &lt;em&gt;niddah&lt;/em&gt;, or ritual impurity. As long as they’re bleeding, and often for at least a week afterward, they can’t have sex with their partner. Many couples won’t hug or kiss, sleep in the same bed, or even pass objects to each other. Under any circumstances, this can be challenging to maintain. Imagine what it’s like under quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to exit this state of &lt;em&gt;niddah&lt;/em&gt;, women must visit the mikvah, usually a small, humid, windowless room where another woman watches them dip, naked, into a pool of water that maybe a dozen other women have already used. For many who observe the laws of &lt;em&gt;niddah&lt;/em&gt;, the prospect of immersing during the COVID-19 outbreak is terrifying: Many mikvahs are highly trafficked spaces that involve extensive bodily exposure. But the alternatives may seem equally untenable: remaining separate from their partner indefinitely, or violating a central commandment of the Torah. For these women, the quarantine has set up an impossible choice between protecting their health and upholding their faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/?utm_source=feed"&gt;[Read: Our pandemic summer]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of days before Passover, Aimee Baron, a mother of five, steeled her nerves and decided to visit the mikvah in her neighborhood in the Bronx. Her family has been leaving the apartment only once a week since the outbreak began; getting her kids, including her 6-year-old twins, through the hallways and lobby without touching anything can be a daunting task. Normally, the mikvah would provide everything she needed to prepare for her immersion—a bath where she could soak before, floss for cleaning her teeth, a comb to untangle her hair. This time, though, she brought her own bag and towel. Her immersion would be quick, but even that was anxiety-producing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every time any of us go outside, we’re all just petrified about touching, petrified about breathing,” she told me. At the mikvah, “there are a thousand surfaces that I have to put my things down on that could have been contaminated.” Like many other mikvahs, the facility in Riverdale has been screening women for symptoms, sanitizing its rooms between uses, and strictly limiting the number of people who can be in the building at the same time. But when the mikvah is the one public space a woman has visited in several weeks, it’s hard not to be wary. Like other Jewish communities, the large population in Riverdale has been hit hard by the outbreak: Some of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/new-york-coronavirus-westchester/2020/03/04/a9e0c5e0-5e48-11ea-b014-4fafa866bb81_story.html"&gt;the first cases of the virus&lt;/a&gt; in New York involved SAR Academy, an Orthodox day school in the area. “We know many, many, many, many, many people who have been sick, who have been on ventilators,” Baron told me. “And we’re praying for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2013/10/jewish-american-full-report-for-web.pdf"&gt;2013 Pew Research Center study&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 10 percent of American Jews are Orthodox—roughly half a million people. Although Orthodox women are by far the most common mikvah users, the pools are also used for Jewish conversions, life-cycle events such as weddings, and men’s immersions before prayer. By and large, these other uses have been put on indefinite hold. “There are a lot of fixtures of Jewish life that Jews can actually live without,” Rivkah Slonim, a Hasidic woman who has written and lectured extensively about mikvah use, told me. “We can be without synagogues. We can be without a Torah scroll. We cannot, in Jewish law, move forward as a community … without a mikvah.” Immersion is a commandment that comes directly from the Torah, and the punishment for violating it—being cut off from God—is severe. That’s why many communities have kept their mikvahs open even when everything else is closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Jewish leaders believe mikvah immersion is safe. Lila Kagedan, a rabbi who works as a bioethicist at several hospitals and universities in New York and Boston, has spent recent weeks advising rabbis and mikvah directors around the country about how to handle the coronavirus crisis. She constantly monitors the latest guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local governments. Mikvahs are not distinctively risky spaces, she told me. She pointed out that many more people go through a grocery store on a typical day than through a mikvah where women are spacing out their immersions, and mikvah attendants aggressively wipe down surfaces and treat the water with sanitizing chemicals. Even so, scientists &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-airborne-go-outside-masks/609235/?utm_source=feed"&gt;are still determining&lt;/a&gt; how the coronavirus travels through the air and how much danger is involved in different activities. And people who appear to be healthy can infect others, according to the CDC. “I can’t say that there’s no risk,” Kagedan said. “There is risk when we go for a walk around the block.” Ariel Sadwin, a regional government-affairs liaison for Agudath Israel of America, a large umbrella organization of Orthodox Jewish communities, has not heard of state governments threatening to shut down mikvahs, he told me, but many rabbis are fearful that this could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mikvahs have found the risks of immersion to be intolerable. Mayyim Hayyim, a pluralist, egalitarian mikvah in Boston, decided in late March to close for the duration of the pandemic. “The board ended up being really split over what to do,” Carrie Bornstein, the executive director, told me. “There was just a really strong feeling, ultimately: If even one person could have the risk of being exposed because of coming to Mayyim Hayyim, we just don’t want to take that risk.” Because Mayyim Hayyim serves a more liberal Jewish population than the typical mikvah, not all of its users abide by the same rules restricting their sex lives as women who observe &lt;em&gt;niddah&lt;/em&gt;. But for all of them, the closure is a burden. A prospective Jewish convert may be disappointed to delay a long-awaited conversion ceremony; a bride might mourn her carefully planned pre-wedding immersion. And queer couples who used Mayyim Hayyim’s mikvah to observe the laws of &lt;em&gt;niddah&lt;/em&gt; now face a challenge of their own: finding a facility in the mostly Orthodox-run network of mikvahs where they feel comfortable immersing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/orthodox-judaism-millennials/476118/?utm_source=feed"&gt;[Read: Why Orthodox Judaism is appealing to so many Millennials]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mikvah dilemma is especially excruciating for women who are trying to get pregnant. If they don’t immerse after their period, they can’t have sex, meaning that they may have to delay conceiving. For most women who observe &lt;em&gt;niddah&lt;/em&gt;, skipping immersion and having sex anyway is likely out of the question: “It would be like eating pig,” Bat Sheva Marcus, an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/magazine/the-orthodox-sex-guru.html"&gt;Orthodox Jewish sex therapist&lt;/a&gt;, told me. Since the pandemic started, social media has been flooded with women debating what to do about immersion. “It’s wrenching,” Marcus said. “Do something that you feel religiously not okay with, or do something that makes you feel unsafe? Neither of those are good options. They’re terrible options.” The pandemic has already created immense challenges for women struggling with infertility: In mid-March, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/parenting/fertility-coronavirus.html"&gt;issued new guidelines&lt;/a&gt; advising doctors to suspend new IVF cycles and cancel elective surgeries and embryo transfers. For women who want to be pregnant, the mikvah can be another reminder that they are not. “My community is in a tremendous amount of pain,” said Baron, the Riverdale mom, who leads an online community for women dealing with fertility issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secular news outlets have &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/hasidic-jews-hold-another-funeral-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/"&gt;widely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/nyregion/coronavirus-hasidic-weddings-brooklyn.html"&gt;condemned&lt;/a&gt; people in New York’s and New Jersey’s Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods who have refused to comply with stay-at-home orders, gathering by the hundreds for funerals and weddings against strong government advice. Simcha Eichenstein, the New York State assemblyman who represents the densely populated Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods of Borough Park and Midwood in Brooklyn, told me that the majority of residents are adhering to New York City guidelines, and many large families are isolating in small apartments to stay safe. Women who otherwise don’t go out at all are still venturing to mikvahs, though. The Crown Heights Mikvah in Brooklyn is seeing 20 to 25 women each night, which is when women typically immerse, said Leah Yechielov, an attendant there. This is a significant reduction in the average traffic to their three pools, but still means that roughly 150 women are going in and out of the facility each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/stockpile-food-my-garage/608290/?utm_source=feed"&gt;[Read: The stockpile of food in my garage]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channie Rappaport, who runs a small mikvah associated with Congregation Zichron Rabbeinu Moshe Feinstein in the suburban-Brooklyn neighborhood of Mill Basin, said that her small facility typically opens only on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, and her husband, the congregation’s rabbi, treats and changes the water himself. But the pandemic has brought them more business than usual: They’ve opened up for daily immersions so that local women don’t have to drive to bigger mikvahs 15 or 20 minutes away. “There’s a tremendous amount of anxiety,” she said. She’s gotten panicked calls from women whose children have health issues, women who have asthma, and women caring for family members who have had cancer. Although people outside of the Orthodox community might say that these women should just stay home, going to the mikvah is not optional in the way that praying together in synagogue or attending family gatherings is, according to Ruth Balinsky Friedman, a clergywoman at Ohev Shalom, an Orthodox synagogue in Washington, D.C. “I very much understand the impulse to see religion as more symbolic—something that we do when we’re able to, but in a time of crisis, we put aside,” she told me. But “you can’t cancel” the commandments governing sex, she said. “That’s the word of God.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are strange times for most families. Spouses have been forced to sleep in separate bedrooms when one of them falls ill. People are sensitized to every touch and aware of every object that might have been handled by someone else. Across America, quarantined families are experiencing the intimacy of distance, finding ways to convey love even when they can’t touch or share space with one another.

They followed angry protests by groups objecting to the shut-down orders in several states; news photos showed many of the protesters wearing Trump hats, many carrying weapons, and some &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/16/michigan-whitmer-conservatives-protest/"&gt;with Confederate flags&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="269" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/Virginia/26bbbb4c2.png" width="600"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="240" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/Michigan/652f04c87.png" width="600"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="257" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/Minnesota/178bd3e33.png" width="600"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this spate of tweeting notable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol type="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.3px;"&gt;As so often with Trump, because of its mere existence. Of course there have been clashes between federal and state policies through U.S. history. In post-World War II America, the clearest cases are from the Civil Rights era. For instance, in 1957, Dwight Eisenhower ordered troops from the 101&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup style="letter-spacing: 0.3px;"&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.3px;"&gt; Airborne to Little Rock, Arkansas, to overcome resistance to school-integration orders, led by the governor, Orval Faubus. In the 1960s, both John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson directed federal efforts to enforce civil-rights orders in Mississippi and elsewhere in the South.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;But these were efforts to bring local practice into accord with nationwide policy. Trump was doing the reverse: implicitly encouraging local resistance to the very strategies his administration is recommending for the country as a whole. Nothing like this has happened since at least the time of Reconstruction, and probably not since before the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Because of its partisanship in a time of national emergency. One state that moved even earlier toward shutdowns than Michigan, Minnesota, or Virginia was Ohio. And in Ohio as in the other three states, there were angry “open things up!” protests at the state capital this week. But the governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, is a Republican, while the governors of the other three states are all Democrats. (Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan, Tim Walz in Minnesota, and Ralph Northam in Virginia. Also, all six U.S. Senators from these states are Democrats.)&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;So at a time when his own White House task force has been trying to work with governors of both parties, Trump was notably singling out “opposition” governors. Also, as reported &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/coronavirus-rules-protests.html"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/far-right-coronavirus-protests-restrictions"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, many of the protests were planned and financed by partisan conservative organizations.&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.3px;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Because of its crudeness and incoherence. As for crudeness: An invocation to “your great 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Amendment” being “under siege” is not subtle enough to qualify as a dog whistle. Chris Murphy, a U.S. Senator from Connecticut (and a Democrat), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1251256360119013377"&gt;spelled it out&lt;/a&gt;:
	&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="478" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/Murphy/e49bc3c6e.png" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1251256360119013377"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
	And, incoherence: The entire premise of the administration’s “mitigation” strategy is to encourage people &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to congregate, so as to reduce the ultimate death toll from the pandemic. The head of that administration was cheering on those defying the strategy.&lt;br&gt;
	  &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Because of the sharpness of the reaction. A few hours before the statement from Chris Murphy, above, New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, gave an extended, mocking retort to Trump at his daily briefing yesterday. You can see it &lt;a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?471302-1/governor-cuomo-federal-government-coronavirus-testing"&gt;on this C-SPAN video&lt;/a&gt;, starting at around time 1:05. “Thank you, Mr. President,” Cuomo said, recounting how often Trump had asked governors for their support. “Thank you &lt;em&gt;for doing your job.&lt;/em&gt;” And he was just getting started, as you can see.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Through these past weeks of pandemic crisis, Cuomo and other governors have been notably collegial and respectful toward Trump and his administration in their public presentations. Like other leaders during other crises, they set aside, for the time being, their personal and partisan differences. But yesterday it was No More Mister Nice Guy from Cuomo.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this during the week when total U.S. deaths from the coronavirus crossed the 35,000 line, and, for the first time in U.S. history, every state in the nation was officially subject to a federal &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/11/every-state-in-the-us-is-now-under-a-major-disaster-declaration-amid-coronavirus-pandemic.html"&gt;“major disaster” declaration&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Fallows</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-fallows/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/notes/2020/04/GettyImages_1210050142/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Jeff Kowalsky /AFP / Getty</media:credit><media:description>Protesters in Michigan</media:description></media:content><title type="html">2020 Time Capsule #15: ‘Liberate’</title><published>2020-04-18T14:51:12-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-18T16:45:08-04:00</updated><summary type="html">On Friday, April 17&amp;#x2014;yesterday, as I write&amp;#x2014;Donald Trump sent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169987110330372"&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169217531056130"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251168994066944003"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; that were unusual even for him.

The apocalyptic genre has boomed in cinema since the start of the Cold War, and plenty of classics have set the template for what a ruined, dystopian future might look like. Think of the barren wastelands of &lt;em&gt;Mad Max&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the emptied-out cities of &lt;em&gt;The Omega Man&lt;/em&gt;, the zombie-overridden &lt;em&gt;Dawn of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;, and other classics such as &lt;em&gt;Escape From New York&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;28 Days Later&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Children of Men&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;WALL-E&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what I’ve always loved about the genre is how it also radically envisions new societies and imagines the best of people, highlighting humanity’s resilience in the toughest circumstances. Postapocalyptic movies are filled with memorable heroes and striking landscapes, and they can offer fascinating insights into life as we know it by conjuring up entirely different modes of existence. Here are some of my favorites, including romantic comedies, sci-fi masterpieces, horror hits, and quiet dramas. Some of my picks fit neatly into the “end of the world” category, and while other selections might be surprising, they’re no less resonant. All are available to watch online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="448" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/MCDTECL_EC014/c107aa043.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Michele K.

But while its forebear portrayed outright destruction, with a monster leveling New York City, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/03/10-cloverfield-lane-review/473313/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 Cloverfield Lane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an even better presentation of an apocalyptic mindset. Set in a fallout bunker, it’s about a battle of wills between Howard (played by John Goodman), a survivalist who insists that the city outside has been destroyed, and Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a young woman who worries that he’s invented the whole scenario to keep her captive. The ensuing drama encapsulates both the cabin fever and paranoia that can come from living in lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to watch: &lt;/b&gt;Rent from &lt;a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/10-cloverfield-lane"&gt;various outlets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;12 Monkeys&lt;/em&gt; (1995, directed by Terry Gilliam)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terry Gilliam has provided multiple visions of humanity’s future, from the baroque dystopia of &lt;em&gt;Brazil &lt;/em&gt;to the dreamy fantasia of &lt;em&gt;The Zero Theorem&lt;/em&gt;. My favorite remains &lt;em&gt;12 Monkeys&lt;/em&gt;, a grim and glorious blockbuster adaptation of Chris Marker’s short film &lt;em&gt;La Jetée&lt;/em&gt;. The 21st-century Earth of &lt;em&gt;12 Monkeys&lt;/em&gt; was destroyed by a weaponized virus, which James Cole (Bruce Willis) must go back in time to prevent. Some of the film’s best shots are of Philadelphia circa 2035, free of people and covered in snow, with wild animals roaming around while humans try to survive underground. Gilliam can find beauty in the most haunting imagery, and &lt;em&gt;12 Monkeys &lt;/em&gt;is packed with frames that simultaneously horrify and delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch:&lt;/strong&gt; Stream on &lt;a href="https://www.sho.com/titles/3477574/twelve-monkeys"&gt;Showtime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; (2001, directed by Steven Spielberg)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the outset, the futuristic world of &lt;em&gt;A.I.—&lt;/em&gt;Steven Spielberg’s ambitious adaptation of a long-gestating Stanley Kubrick project&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;has already weathered catastrophe. Major cities are flooded and civilization is overrun by dilapidated “mechas,” a robot underclass built to serve a dwindling human race. But the film is most striking in its last act, which jumps millennia ahead to depict an Earth populated only by artificial beings that still cherish their extinct creators. The story line follows the robot child David (Haley Joel Osment) on a &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio&lt;/em&gt;-inspired quest to become flesh and blood. Though the fairy-tale setup turned off many critics, it’s just gauzy wrapping for a dark fable that presents the ability to love as humanity’s greatest strength and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to watch: &lt;/b&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RF87JQ6?camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07RF87JQ6&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;tag=justwatch09-20"&gt;Prime Video&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pluto.tv/on-demand/movies/a.i.-artificial-intelligence-1-1"&gt;Pluto TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; (2009, directed by James Cameron)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earth is barely glimpsed in &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;, but the prologue to James Cameron’s sci-fi epic hints at tragic conditions: The planet’s resources have been drained and its lands scoured by warring private contractors. The distant moon of Pandora is an unspoiled paradise, a Day-Glo mix of floating mountains and dense forests inhabited by lithe aliens that exist in concert with nature. So what do humans do when they arrive? Conquer, pillage, and blow things up, making the same mistakes that doomed them to search for new lands in the first place. Cameron’s blockbuster allegory isn’t subtle—his films rarely are—but it is pointed, and despite making America the explicit bad guy, &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; became the nation’s biggest box-office hit of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to watch: &lt;/b&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/avatar/2YOnkRN4LwZZ"&gt;Disney+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blast from the Past&lt;/em&gt; (1999, directed by Hugh Wilson)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bunker movie is an explicit comedy: After a 1960s family’s nuclear fears lead them to hunker down for 35 years, they emerge in 1999 and are bewildered by how much things have changed. &lt;em&gt;Blast From the Past &lt;/em&gt;is one of the more underrated rom-coms of the ’90s, casting the square-jawed Brendan Fraser as Adam, a man out of time who falls for a modern gal, Eve (Alicia Silverstone). Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek give appropriately odd performances as Adam’s frozen-in-time parents. Amid the fish-out-of-water humor is a look back at an earlier era of American paranoia, one papered over with chipper pieces of pop culture such as &lt;em&gt;I Love Lucy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch:&lt;/strong&gt; Stream on &lt;a href="https://therokuchannel.roku.com/details/16daf22978695b09a0daf2b21409bafe"&gt;the Roku Channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Caught Fire&lt;/em&gt; (1961, directed by Val Guest)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apocalyptic movies proliferated after World War II, with the atomic age and the Cold War fueling decades of dystopian fiction about what could happen next. One of the cleverest, soberest examples of the genre is this under-seen British classic, in which a rash of nuclear testing causes the planet to heat uncontrollably. Val Guest finds innovative ways to depict the horror, with orange-tinged lighting and matte paintings of abandoned cities. But the film stands out because it’s set mostly in the offices of a London newspaper, where a group of reporters attempts to make sense of its collapsing circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to watch: &lt;/b&gt;Rent from &lt;a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-day-the-earth-caught-fire"&gt;various outlets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="361" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/MSDDELI_EC008/05c2f4711.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Everett collection&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delicatessen &lt;/em&gt;(1991, directed by Marc Caro &amp;amp; Jean-Pierre Jeunet)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A breakout debut for its French directors, &lt;em&gt;Delicatessen &lt;/em&gt;laid out an aesthetic that would dominate movie design throughout the ’90s, a steampunk future with a ramshackle DIY quality to its technology. What happened to the outside world, which viewers see as a sulfurous wasteland, isn’t explained; the action is confined to a crumbling apartment building, where a cruel landlord butchers his tenants to sell as meat. &lt;em&gt;Delicatessen &lt;/em&gt;is anarchic, violent, and bizarre, but it also contains an achingly cute romance between the landlord’s daughter (Marie-Laure Dougnac) and his next victim (Dominique Pinon). It’s an eschatological comedy that acknowledges how brutality and optimism can thrive side by side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to watch: &lt;/b&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/delicatessen"&gt;the Criterion Channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YYW5SZG?camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07YYW5SZG&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;tag=justwatch09-20"&gt;Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Life&lt;/em&gt; (2018, directed by Claire Denis)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Claire Denis’ latest movie has a sci-fi setting, the French director has called it a &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/claire-denis-high-life-interview.html"&gt;prison film&lt;/a&gt;, given that its characters are mostly inmates sentenced to a future of hard labor on an interstellar spaceship. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/04/high-life-review-claire-denis-robert-pattinson/586447/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; follows Monte (Robert Pattinson), a convict who becomes the last survivor of a mission to explore a black hole. The film is primarily concerned with how he’s managed to retain his humanity and empathy, both in space and on the bleak, industrial-looking Earth he came from. &lt;em&gt;High Life &lt;/em&gt;is an alienating experience, but it’s one of Denis’ best works, a vision of an even more stratified future built on the backs of the most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to watch: &lt;/b&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S6R482L?camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07S6R482L&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;tag=justwatch09-20"&gt;Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt; (2014, dir. Christopher Nolan)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To depict the end of the world, Christopher Nolan reached into history, creating a futuristic version of the Dust Bowl and using footage from Ken Burns’s &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/dustbowl/"&gt;documentary about the disaster&lt;/a&gt; to explain it. &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt; is loaded with jarring visual touches, including a cornfield &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/interstellar-christopher-nolan-started-a-lucrative-side-business-selling-corn-grown-on-set-9822607.html"&gt;incongruously surrounded by mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the New York Yankees playing in a high-school baseball stadium. Though much of the action is set in space, Nolan takes time to build out the parameters of his struggling Earth. The director tells an apocalypse story that’s centered on the family of the astronaut Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), thus investing the audience in Cooper’s mission to pull humans back from the brink of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/movie/interstellar"&gt;FX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oblivion &lt;/em&gt;(2013, directed by Joseph Kosinski)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual-effects technology had advanced enough by 2013 that &lt;em&gt;Oblivion &lt;/em&gt;could delight in portraying an empty Earth, with scenes of a high-tech janitor (Tom Cruise) zooming around famous landmarks on a planet abandoned after an intergalactic war. Joseph Kosinski (who also made &lt;em&gt;Tron: Legacy &lt;/em&gt;and the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt;) excels at visual tableaux, and &lt;em&gt;Oblivion &lt;/em&gt;unfurls its dramatic landscapes with aplomb. Though the twists of &lt;em&gt;Oblivion&lt;/em&gt;’s sci-fi story are routine, the aesthetics of Kosinski’s sparse future, in which every piece of technology looks like it rolled off the Apple assembly line, are eerily resonant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Rent from &lt;a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/oblivion-2013"&gt;various outlets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Princess Mononoke&lt;/em&gt; (1997, directed by Hayao Miyazaki)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Hayao Miyazaki’s dark fantasy film is set hundreds of years ago, during Japan’s Muromachi period, this environmental epic has a sharp message about humanity’s doomed present and future. Many of Miyazaki’s movies obliquely explore how industrialism and pollution throw the natural world out of balance; &lt;em&gt;Princess Mononoke &lt;/em&gt;charges directly at that conflict, following the fantastical disruptions that ensue when humans build a settlement in a mystical forest. The spirits that emerge to battle the humans are among Miyazaki’s most transfixing. Equally crucial is the sympathy he extends to his apparent villain, Lady Eboshi—a rigid and protective ruler whose need to expand her territory is depicted with nuance rather than simplistic malevolence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Buy from &lt;a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/princess-mononoke"&gt;various outlets&lt;/a&gt;; stream on HBO Max (forthcoming)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Quiet Earth &lt;/em&gt;(1995, directed by Geoff Murphy)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A criminally under-seen classic from New Zealand’s 1980s boom of exciting and original cinema, &lt;em&gt;The Quiet Earth &lt;/em&gt;has a familiar setup: A man (Bruno Lawrence) wakes up alone on a seemingly deserted Earth. Though some of the plot sees him trying to unravel the mystery of what happened to the planet, the film is more concerned with the fragile mental state of its protagonist as he navigates his new, lonely existence. It’s the best work by Geoff Murphy, who examined life in New Zealand from many challenging angles before being lured to Hollywood to make mediocre blockbusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://www.kanopy.com/product/quiet-earth"&gt;Kanopy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/title/11642024"&gt;Hoopla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Safe&lt;/em&gt; (1995, directed by Todd Haynes)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The apocalypse in &lt;em&gt;Safe &lt;/em&gt;is an entirely personal one: Carol White (Julianne Moore), a suburban housewife, is besieged by a variety of inexplicable illnesses and allergies, and struggles to convince others of the seriousness of her condition. Todd Haynes’s film is a deeply allegorical tale of the precariousness of life at the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but its themes are worryingly applicable today. Haynes and Moore communicate the paranoia that each new symptom provokes in Carol, and show how her efforts to self-quarantine begin to degrade her mental health. &lt;em&gt;Safe &lt;/em&gt;isn’t a film with easy answers, but therein lies much of its power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/safe"&gt;the Criterion Channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="446" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/MCDSOTA_EC013/88c8aa837.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Universal / Everett Collection&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Southland Tales&lt;/em&gt; (2006, directed by Richard Kelly)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his 2001 cult hit, &lt;i&gt;Donnie Darko&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;the writer and director Richard Kelly crafted this gonzo epic, a dense and often wildly funny portrait of a near-future America on the brink of destruction. Attempting to summarize the plot of &lt;i&gt;Southland Tales &lt;/i&gt;is a fool’s errand—the film itself struggles to explain everything, and Kelly planned multiple graphic novels to lay out its extended back story. But his visions of a government surveilling its citizens, Hollywood movie stars (played by Dwayne Johnson and Sarah Michelle Gellar) becoming the leaders of a Marxist revolution, and a never-ending War on Terror driving the country into madness all feel oddly prescient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://mubi.com/films/southland-tales"&gt;Mubi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stalker&lt;/em&gt; (1979, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the most influential work of apocalyptic cinema is Andrei Tarkovsky’s sci-fi masterpiece, which harnesses the deserted landscapes surrounding abandoned Soviet power and chemical plants to imagine an ominous future. Much of the action is confined to “the Zone,” an empty part of the world where the laws of reality do not apply; the story follows a writer and a professor trying to navigate this region with the help of the Stalker (Alexander Kaidanovsky). The polluted areas where Tarkovsky filmed look alien and forbidding, perfectly mirroring &lt;em&gt;Stalker&lt;/em&gt;’s inscrutable plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/stalker"&gt;the Criterion Channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kanopy.com/product/stalker-0"&gt;Kanopy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: First Contact&lt;/em&gt; (1996, directed by Jonathan Frakes)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The universe of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;’s many television shows is a utopia where the citizens of Earth have dispensed with such petty concerns as poverty and global conflict. But that society emerged only after a nuclear war ravaged the planet. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: First Contact&lt;/em&gt; transports the crew of the Enterprise back in time to the brink of civilization’s collapse to do battle with the alien Borg. It’s one of the best editions in the &lt;em&gt;Trek &lt;/em&gt;film franchise because of both its compelling action and its high stakes—Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew are fighting to ensure a future that’s anything but apocalyptic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/title/12460301"&gt;Hoopla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.popcornflix.com/movie/18-8rxqmbup1tgo-star-trek-viii-first-contact?channel=most-popular"&gt;Popcornflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synecdoche, New York&lt;/em&gt; (2008, directed by Charlie Kaufman)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie Kaufman’s directorial debut is ostensibly about an art project that gets out of hand when the theater director Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman) uses a MacArthur Fellowship to stage a play that encompasses all of human experience. Set in a giant Manhattan warehouse, the film follows Caden’s efforts to mimic reality as best he can, first dramatizing his own life, then casting actors to play the actors shadowing him and his family, and so on, until his production has become a fully functional city unto itself. &lt;em&gt;Synecdoche, New York &lt;/em&gt;is bubbling over with so many philosophical themes and implications that it alienated some audiences when it was first released. One of its most fascinating insights, though, is how humanity—much like a virus—replicates itself in unpredictable ways, eventually turning a quiet domestic drama into a much larger crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://pluto.tv/on-demand/movies/synecdoche-new-york-2008-1-1"&gt;Pluto TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; (2003, directed by Michael Haneke)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Haneke, the Austrian master of hostility and despair, has made many films (such as &lt;em&gt;Funny Games&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Seventh Continent&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The White Ribbon&lt;/em&gt;) that reflect the disintegration of society. But his only explicitly futuristic work is &lt;em&gt;Time of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;, a chilling drama set after some unspecified global disaster. It follows a family (headed by Isabelle Huppert) fleeing the city and finding their country cottage occupied by strangers; from there, further horrors descend, always rendered with the dreadful mundanity that is Haneke’s specialty. The film’s most effective scares are some of the simplest, using nighttime photography to increase the sense of ongoing menace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081D7NXVJ?camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B081D7NXVJ&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;tag=justwatch09-20"&gt;Mubi on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Truman Show&lt;/em&gt; (1998, directed by Peter Weir)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world of &lt;em&gt;The Truman Show &lt;/em&gt;is anything but apocalyptic: It’s an idyllic seaside community where everything functions like clockwork and the residents’ biggest anxieties are about what to eat for dinner each night. But that’s what’s so wonderfully creepy about &lt;em&gt;The Truman Show&lt;/em&gt;, a sci-fi vision of reality television that satirizes America’s pompous postwar exceptionalism. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the star of a TV show he doesn’t know exists, living inside an artificial bubble created only for him. (As an announcer proudly proclaims, Truman was the first child ever adopted by a corporation.) Even though Truman’s scripted life seems perfect, Peter Weir uses its cookie-cutter conformity to illustrate a disturbing world frozen in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to watch: &lt;/b&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://www.starz.com/us/en/movies/44003"&gt;Starz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.directv.com/movies/The-Truman-Show-WDBjVUZEZDEzTW04blJLK3dQMDJ5dz09"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Us&lt;/em&gt; (2019, directed by Jordan Peele)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implausibility of Jordan Peele’s wonderful horror film was a sticking point for some critics on release, but that’s part of its elaborate surrealism. In &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/us-jordan-peele-new-movie-gloriously-complex/585232/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the real apocalypse happened long ago, but Americans either don’t know about it or refuse to think about it. Meanwhile, people’s “tethered” doubles, the results of a failed government experiment, live dreary mirror lives underground. The metaphor is broad enough to encompass any injustice people try to ignore from day to day, be it poverty, homelessness, or racial inequality. The film’s plot, which sees the Tethered emerging to overthrow the social order, is equal parts terrifying and funny. In other words, it’s perfectly within Peele’s wheelhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://play.hbonow.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXXKTvgwHm8PCwgEAAANe"&gt;HBO Now&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.directv.com/movies/Us-aUlnY0l2bTdGMXpEbkNYWk5qaG9udz09"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanilla Sky&lt;/em&gt; (2001, directed by Cameron Crowe)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most memorable shot in Cameron Crowe’s remake of the Spanish film &lt;i&gt;Open Your Eyes&lt;/i&gt;—Tom Cruise running through an empty Times Square—was accomplished through a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2001/12/14/behind-bare-times-square-scene/"&gt;feat of scheduling&lt;/a&gt;. Now, as Manhattan remains mostly devoid of people, the film feels resonant, not only for imagining an abandoned New York, but also for satirizing how far people will go to return to normalcy after a trauma. Summarizing &lt;i&gt;Vanilla Sky &lt;/i&gt;is tough, but the gist is that the millionaire publishing playboy David Aames (Cruise) is injured in a car accident and resorts to a strange, dream-based form of sci-fi therapy to eliminate his scars. Crowe’s film is bizarre and ambitious, but its best sequences—such as David’s journey through a vacant metropolis—are its most nightmarish ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Stream on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICII5O?camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000ICII5O&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;tag=justwatch09-20"&gt;Starz on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Village &lt;/em&gt;(2004, directed by M. Night Shyamalan)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Village &lt;/em&gt;might be M. Night Shyamalan’s best and most complete piece of storytelling: a parable of what happens when a community tries to seal itself away from hardship. Set in a rustic town that’s cut off from the outside world and surrounded by red-cloaked monsters, &lt;em&gt;The Village &lt;/em&gt;is mostly a portrait of the comfort and terror that come with voluntary isolation; it explores America’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/9/11/9309749/the-village-shyamalan-good"&gt;post-9/11 mindset&lt;/a&gt; by telling a story of a town that seeks only the illusion of safety at the cost of every other liberty. Shyamalan’s reputation for twist endings somewhat overhyped the movie’s initial rollout, since audiences went in with high expectations for a surprise finale. But while the big reveal in &lt;em&gt;The Village &lt;/em&gt;was initially mocked, it makes tragic thematic sense, and only deepens the viewing experience on rewatch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to watch: &lt;/b&gt;Rent from &lt;a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-village"&gt;various outlets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Sims</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/david-sims/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/Moviesv2/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Moviestore Collection / Entertainment Pictures / Alamy / The Atlantic</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">22 Movies About the End of the World to Watch Now</title><published>2020-04-18T09:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T12:24:47-04:00</updated><summary type="html">These films aren’t all bleak—or obviously about an apocalypse.
