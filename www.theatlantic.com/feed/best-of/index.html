Chronic ills—a corrupt political class, a sclerotic bureaucracy, a heartless economy, a divided and distracted public—had gone untreated for years. We had learned to live, uncomfortably, with the symptoms. It took the scale and intimacy of a pandemic to expose their severity—to shock Americans with the recognition that we are in the high-risk category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crisis demanded a response that was swift, rational, and collective. The United States reacted instead like Pakistan or Belarus—like a country with shoddy infrastructure and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/white-house-set-fail/607960/?utm_source=feed"&gt;a dysfunctional government&lt;/a&gt; whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering. The administration squandered two irretrievable months to prepare. From the president came &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-coronavirus-threat/607825/?utm_source=feed"&gt;willful blindness, scapegoating, boasts, and lies&lt;/a&gt;. From his mouthpieces, conspiracy theories and miracle cures. A few senators and corporate executives acted quickly—not to prevent the coming disaster, but to profit from it. When a government doctor tried to warn the public of the danger, the White House took the mic and politicized the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every morning in the endless month of March, Americans woke up to find themselves citizens of a failed state. With no national plan—no coherent instructions at all—&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/america-isnt-failing-its-pandemic-testwashington-is/608026/?utm_source=feed"&gt;families, schools, and offices were left to decide on their own whether to shut down and take shelter&lt;/a&gt;. When test kits, masks, gowns, and ventilators were found to be in desperately short supply, governors pleaded for them from the White House, which stalled, then called on private enterprise, which couldn’t deliver. States and cities were forced into bidding wars that left them prey to price gouging and corporate profiteering. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/04/crafts-coronavirus-quarantine-stress-relief/609187/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Civilians took out their sewing machines&lt;/a&gt; to try to keep ill-equipped hospital workers healthy and their patients alive. Russia, Taiwan, and the United Nations sent humanitarian aid to the world’s richest power—a beggar nation in utter chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-america-constitution/608665/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Adam Chilton, Kevin Cope, Charles Crabtree, and Mila Versteeg: Red and blue America agree that now is the time to violate the Constitution&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump saw the crisis almost entirely in personal and political terms. Fearing for his reelection, he declared the coronavirus pandemic a war, and himself a wartime president. But the leader he brings to mind is Marshal Philippe Pétain, the French general who, in 1940, signed an armistice with Germany after its rout of French defenses, then formed the pro-Nazi Vichy regime. Like Pétain, Trump collaborated with the invader and abandoned his country to a prolonged disaster. And, like France in 1940, America in 2020 has stunned itself with a collapse that’s larger and deeper than one miserable leader. Some future autopsy of the pandemic might be called &lt;em&gt;Strange Defeat&lt;/em&gt;, after the historian and Resistance fighter Marc Bloch’s &lt;a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/Strange-Defeat/"&gt;contemporaneous study of the fall of France&lt;/a&gt;. Despite countless examples around the U.S. of individual courage and sacrifice, the failure is national. And it should force a question that most Americans have never had to ask: Do we trust our leaders and one another enough to summon a collective response to a mortal threat? Are we still capable of self-government?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the third major crisis of the short 21st century. The first, on September 11, 2001, came when Americans were still living mentally in the previous century, and the memory of depression, world war, and cold war remained strong. On that day, people in the rural heartland did not see New York as an alien stew of immigrants and liberals that deserved its fate, but as a great American city that had taken a hit for the whole country. Firefighters from Indiana drove 800 miles to help the rescue effort at Ground Zero. Our civic reflex was to mourn and mobilize together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan politics and terrible policies, especially the Iraq War, erased the sense of national unity and fed a bitterness toward the political class that never really faded. The second crisis, in 2008, intensified it. At the top, the financial crash could almost be considered a success. Congress passed a bipartisan bailout bill that saved the financial system. Outgoing Bush-administration officials cooperated with incoming Obama administration officials. The experts at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department used monetary and fiscal policy to prevent a second Great Depression. Leading bankers were shamed but not prosecuted; most of them kept their fortunes and some their jobs. Before long they were back in business. A Wall Street trader told me that the financial crisis had been a “speed bump.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the lasting pain was felt in the middle and at the bottom, by Americans who had taken on debt and lost their jobs, homes, and retirement savings. Many of them never recovered, and young people who came of age in the Great Recession are doomed to be poorer than their parents. Inequality—the fundamental, relentless force in American life since the late 1970s—grew worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This second crisis drove a profound wedge between Americans: between the upper and lower classes, Republicans and Democrats, metropolitan and rural people, the native-born and immigrants, ordinary Americans and their leaders. Social bonds had been under growing strain for several decades, and now they began to tear. The reforms of the Obama years, important as they were—in health care, financial regulation, green energy—had only palliative effects. The long recovery over the past decade enriched corporations and investors, lulled professionals, and left the working class further behind. The lasting effect of the slump was to increase polarization and to discredit authority, especially government’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both parties were slow to grasp how much credibility they’d lost. The coming politics was populist. Its harbinger wasn’t Barack Obama but Sarah Palin, the absurdly unready vice-presidential candidate who scorned expertise and reveled in celebrity. She was Donald Trump’s John the Baptist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/americans-are-paying-the-price-for-trumps-failures/609532/?utm_source=feed"&gt;David Frum: Americans are paying the price for Trump’s failures&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump came to power as the repudiation of the Republican establishment. But the conservative political class and the new leader soon reached an understanding. Whatever their differences on issues like trade and immigration, they shared a basic goal: to strip-mine public assets for the benefit of private interests. Republican politicians and donors who wanted government to do as little as possible for the common good could live happily with a regime that barely knew how to govern at all, and they made themselves Trump’s footmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a wanton boy throwing matches in a parched field, Trump began to immolate what was left of national civic life. He never even pretended to be president of the whole country, but pitted us against one another along lines of race, sex, religion, citizenship, education, region, and—every day of his presidency—political party. His main tool of governance was to lie. A third of the country locked itself in a hall of mirrors that it believed to be reality; a third drove itself mad with the effort to hold on to the idea of knowable truth; and a third gave up even trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump acquired a federal government crippled by years of right-wing ideological assault, politicization by both parties, and steady defunding. He set about finishing off the job and destroying the professional civil service. He drove out some of the most talented and experienced career officials, left essential positions unfilled, and installed loyalists as commissars over the cowed survivors, with one purpose: to serve his own interests. His major legislative accomplishment, one of the largest tax cuts in history, sent hundreds of billions of dollars to corporations and the rich. The beneficiaries flocked to patronize his resorts and line his reelection pockets. If lying was his means for using power, corruption was his end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-testing-rich-people/608062/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: It pays to be rich during a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the American landscape that lay open to the virus: in prosperous cities, a class of globally connected desk workers dependent on a class of precarious and invisible service workers; in the countryside, decaying communities in revolt against the modern world; on social media, mutual hatred and endless vituperation among different camps; in the economy, even with full employment, a large and growing gap between triumphant capital and beleaguered labor; in Washington, an empty government led by a con man and his intellectually bankrupt party; around the country, a mood of cynical exhaustion, with no vision of a shared identity or future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;If the pandemic&lt;/span&gt; really is a kind of war, it’s the first to be fought on this soil in a century and a half. Invasion and occupation expose a society’s fault lines, exaggerating what goes unnoticed or accepted in peacetime, clarifying essential truths, raising the smell of buried rot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus should have united Americans against a common threat. With different leadership, it might have. Instead, even as it spread from blue to red areas, attitudes broke down along familiar partisan lines. The virus also should have been a great leveler. You don’t have to be in the military or in debt to be a target—you just have to be human. But from the start, its effects have been skewed by the inequality that we’ve tolerated for so long. When tests for the virus were almost impossible to find, the wealthy and connected—the model and reality-TV host Heidi Klum, the entire roster of the Brooklyn Nets, the president’s conservative allies—&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/coronavirus-testing-elite.html"&gt;were somehow able to get tested, despite many showing no symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. The smattering of individual results did nothing to protect public health. Meanwhile, ordinary people with fevers and chills had to wait in long and possibly infectious lines, only to be turned away because they weren’t actually suffocating. An internet joke proposed that the only way to find out whether you had the virus was to sneeze in a rich person’s face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Trump was asked about this blatant unfairness, he expressed disapproval but added, “&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-5/"&gt;Perhaps that’s been the story of life&lt;/a&gt;.” Most Americans hardly register this kind of special privilege in normal times. But in the first weeks of the pandemic it sparked outrage, as if, during a general mobilization, the rich had been allowed to buy their way out of military service and hoard gas masks. As the contagion has spread, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/nyregion/coronavirus-race-deaths.html"&gt;its victims have been likely to be poor, black, and brown people&lt;/a&gt;. The gross inequality of our health-care system is evident in the sight of refrigerated trucks lined up outside public hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/race-and-blame/609946/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Ibram X. Kendi: Stop blaming black people for dying of the coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now have two categories of work: essential and nonessential. Who have the essential workers turned out to be? Mostly people in low-paying jobs that require their physical presence and put their health directly at risk: warehouse workers, shelf-stockers, Instacart shoppers, delivery drivers, municipal employees, hospital staffers, home health aides, long-haul truckers. Doctors and nurses are the pandemic’s combat heroes, but the supermarket cashier with her bottle of sanitizer and the UPS driver with his latex gloves are the supply and logistics troops who keep the frontline forces intact. In a smartphone economy that hides whole classes of human beings, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/i-work-grocery-store-dont-call-me-hero/610147/?utm_source=feed"&gt;we’re learning where our food and goods come from, who keeps us alive&lt;/a&gt;. An order of organic baby arugula on AmazonFresh is cheap and arrives overnight in part because the people who grow it, sort it, pack it, and deliver it have to keep working while sick. For most service workers, sick leave turns out to be an impossible luxury. It’s worth asking if we would accept a higher price and slower delivery so that they could stay home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="callout-placeholder" data-source="curated"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has also clarified the meaning of nonessential workers. One example is Kelly Loeffler, the Republican junior senator from Georgia, whose sole qualification for the empty seat that she was given in January is her immense wealth. Less than three weeks into the job, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/congress-insider-trading-problem/608488/?utm_source=feed"&gt;after a dire private briefing about the virus, she got even richer from the selling-off of stocks&lt;/a&gt;, then she accused Democrats of exaggerating the danger and gave her constituents false assurances that may well have gotten them killed. Loeffler’s impulses in public service are those of a dangerous parasite. A body politic that would place someone like this in high office is well advanced in decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purest embodiment of political nihilism is not Trump himself but his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. In his short lifetime, Kushner has been fraudulently promoted as both a meritocrat and a populist. He was born into a moneyed real-estate family the month Ronald Reagan entered the Oval Office, in 1981—a princeling of the second Gilded Age. Despite Jared’s mediocre academic record, he was admitted to Harvard after his father, Charles, pledged a $2.5 million donation to the university. Father helped son with $10 million in loans for a start in the family business, then Jared continued his elite education at the law and business schools of NYU, where his father had contributed $3 million. Jared repaid his father’s support with fierce loyalty when Charles was sentenced to two years in federal prison in 2005 for trying to resolve a family legal quarrel by entrapping his sister’s husband with a prostitute and videotaping the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/trump-is-the-chinese-governments-most-useful-idiot/608638/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Adam Serwer: Trump is inciting a coronavirus culture war to save himself&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jared Kushner failed as a skyscraper owner and a newspaper publisher, but he always found someone to rescue him, and his self-confidence only grew. In &lt;em&gt;American Oligarchs&lt;/em&gt;, Andrea Bernstein describes how he adopted the outlook of a risk-taking entrepreneur, a “disruptor” of the new economy. Under the influence of his mentor Rupert Murdoch, he found ways to fuse his financial, political, and journalistic pursuits. He made conflicts of interest his business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when his father-in-law became president, Kushner quickly gained power in an administration that raised amateurism, nepotism, and corruption to governing principles. As long as he busied himself with Middle East peace, his feckless meddling didn’t matter to most Americans. But since he became an influential adviser to Trump on the coronavirus pandemic, the result has been mass death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his first week on the job, in mid-March, Kushner co-authored the worst Oval Office speech in memory, interrupted the vital work of other officials, may have compromised security protocols, flirted with conflicts of interest and violations of federal law, and made fatuous promises that quickly turned to dust. “&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kushner-coronavirus-team-sparks-confusion-plaudits-inside-white-house-response-efforts/2020/03/18/02038a16-6874-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html"&gt;The federal government is not designed to solve all our problems&lt;/a&gt;,” he said, explaining how he would tap his corporate connections to create drive-through testing sites. They never materialized. He was convinced by corporate leaders that Trump should not use presidential authority to compel industries to manufacture ventilators—then Kushner’s own attempt to negotiate a deal with General Motors fell through. With no loss of faith in himself, he blamed shortages of necessary equipment and gear on incompetent state governors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To watch this pale, slim-suited dilettante &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/01/jared-kushner-coronavirus-response-160553"&gt;breeze into the middle of a deadly crisis&lt;/a&gt;, dispensing business-school jargon to cloud the massive failure of his father-in-law’s administration, is to see the collapse of a whole approach to governing. It turns out that scientific experts and other civil servants are not traitorous members of a “deep state”—&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/now-trump-needs-deep-state-fight-coronavirus/605752/?utm_source=feed"&gt;they’re essential workers&lt;/a&gt;, and marginalizing them in favor of ideologues and sycophants is a threat to the nation’s health. It turns out that “nimble” companies can’t prepare for a catastrophe or distribute lifesaving goods—&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/trump-ensuring-worst-possible-outcome-coronavirus-crisis/607867/?utm_source=feed"&gt;only a competent federal government can do that&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out that everything has a cost, and years of attacking government, squeezing it dry and draining its morale, inflict a heavy cost that the public has to pay in lives. All the programs defunded, stockpiles depleted, and plans scrapped meant that we had become a second-rate nation. Then came the virus and this strange defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/trump-coronavirus-message/610009/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Trump’s coronavirus message is revisionist history&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight to overcome the pandemic must also be a fight to recover the health of our country, and build it anew, or the hardship and grief we’re now enduring will never be redeemed. Under our current leadership, nothing will change. If 9/11 and 2008 wore out trust in the old political establishment, 2020 should kill off the idea that anti-politics is our salvation. But putting an end to this regime, so necessary and deserved, is only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re faced with a choice that the crisis makes inescapably clear. We can stay hunkered down in self-isolation, fearing and shunning one another, letting our common bond wear away to nothing. Or we can use this pause in our normal lives to pay attention to the hospital workers holding up cellphones so their patients can say goodbye to loved ones; &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-health-care-workers-plane-to-new-york-city-from-atlanta-join-covid-19-battle-hospitals/"&gt;the planeload of medical workers flying from Atlanta to help in New York&lt;/a&gt;; the aerospace workers in Massachusetts demanding that their factory be converted to ventilator production; the Floridians standing in long lines because they couldn’t get through by phone to the skeletal unemployment office; the residents of Milwaukee braving endless waits, hail, and contagion to &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/supreme-courts-hypocrisy-going-get-americans-killed/609598/?utm_source=feed"&gt;vote in an election forced on them by partisan justices&lt;/a&gt;. We can learn from these dreadful days that stupidity and injustice are lethal; that, in a democracy, being a citizen is essential work; that the alternative to solidarity is death. After we’ve come out of hiding and taken off our masks, we should not forget what it was like to be alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article appears in the June 2020 print edition with the headline “Underlying Conditions.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>George Packer</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/george-packer/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2020/04/DIS_Packer_UnderlyingHomepage/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Oliver Munday</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">We Are Living in a Failed State</title><published>2020-04-20T07:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T14:14:47-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The coronavirus didn’t break America.

But such a request would further humiliate the Soviet state, already deeply shamed by the backwardness and incompetence revealed by the accident. Instead, the Soviets resort to “biorobots”—human beings. Teams of workers will hazard the radiation that disabled machines. To save itself, the regime will sacrifice its people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought of that scene during President Donald Trump’s press conference Thursday about reopening the U.S. economy. The press conference lacked the drama of the HBO series. There was no single moment where the scheme was revealed in its enormity. Yet the intentions are becoming clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/peter-wehner-trump-presidency-over/607969/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Peter Wehner: The Trump presidency is over&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration has two plans for the next six months. It is implementing them at the same time. They reinforce each other, and each can replace the other if either fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plan A is the Chernobyl plan: trading higher human casualties in hopes of a triumph for the central state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By reopening some aspects of the U.S. economy in the next few weeks, Trump hopes to goose the stock market and restore jobs. It’s plainly impossible to return to full employment by November 2020, but Trump can hope that the &lt;em&gt;trajectory&lt;/em&gt; of the economy will matter more than the economy’s absolute level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1984, as Ronald Reagan ran for reelection, unemployment still stood at 7.2 percent. But the economy was adding jobs fast through 1984: a &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1985/02/art1full.pdf"&gt;net increase of 1.3 million&lt;/a&gt; from the year before. That’s why the Reagan ads called it “morning in America”: the sun was not yet fully risen in November 1984, but there was no mistaking that a better day lay ahead. Trump apparently hopes that by reopening now, he can make the same claim in time for his own reelection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this plan has come into view, critics have replied that the president lacks the power to reopen the American economy. Stay-in-place orders were issued by governors and mayors, not the federal government. The airlines were grounded for lack of passengers, not by presidential order. If Trump did not switch the economy off, how can he switch the economy back on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things are more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump may not have legal power to order people back to work. But he has tremendous power over the economic resources that allow most people to &lt;em&gt;stay away&lt;/em&gt; from work. The $1,200 per person signed into law March 27 will not last long. The $600-a-week federal supplement to state unemployment-insurance benefits will expire July 31. The mortgage forbearance in the March 27 law is conditional, limited, and temporary. Rent forbearance is even more conditional, limited, and temporary. Thirty-one percent of American renters &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/no-rent-was-paid-in-april-by-nearly-a-third-of-american-renters-2020-04-08?mod=mw_latestnews&amp;amp;link=sfmw_tw"&gt;paid no rent&lt;/a&gt; in the first week of April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless federal aid is extended and expanded, workers will soon be driven to return to work by economic necessity. If Trump withholds his signature, federal aid cannot be extended or expanded. So yes, Trump has a lot of power over the closing or opening of the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has another power, too. Half the states are led by Republican governors. With rare exceptions—Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, Larry Hogan in Maryland—Trump defines for those governors the limits of the politically possible. If Trump urges reopening, he gives permission to Republican governors who want to reopen fast, like Florida’s Ron DeSantis. He also puts pressure on Republican governors who would prefer to go slow, like Ohio’s Mike DeWine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reopening early will lead to higher mortality from COVID-19. How much higher? Here’s where the brutal reality of Plan A bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Trump reopening in May will be only a partial reopening. Not all backs are equally exposed to the whip of immediate necessity. Trump can readily enough impel office cleaners back to the bank towers; he will have a harder time with the bankers themselves. Administration officials speak of a “phased reopening.” But if the reopening starts in May, it will be phased not by medical advice, but by the hard grammar of wealth and poverty: poorest first, richest last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/underlying-conditions/610261/?utm_source=feed"&gt;George Packer: We are living in a failed state&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event of an early and partial reopening, the disparities can only widen. Those who can telecommute, who can shop online, or who work for health-conscious employers like public universities will be better positioned to minimize their exposure than those called back to work in factories, plants, and delivery services. The economy will be further divided along its widening class fault: those who can control their contacts with others, and those who cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not have to be this way. If the Trump administration had not bungled testing, if it were not to this day jerking and lurching in obedience to the president’s latest ego demand, we could by now begin to see the way to a safer reopening in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is, the United States will be nearly as blind in May as it was in March. The testing regime remains bottlenecked and slow. Contact tracing barely exists. The people called back to work in the next few weeks will wear masks and stand farther apart from one another. But we are nowhere near the point of promptly identifying sick workers and effectively isolating them while they remain infectious.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plans for a May return imply acceptance of significant infection and higher casualties. Pro-Trump talkers boast that they will volunteer for these risks themselves. Broadcaster Glenn Beck &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/glenn-beck-wants-seniors-to-work-even-if-we-all-get-sick.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on March 25:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would rather have my children stay home and all of us who are over 50 go in and keep this economy going and working even if we all get sick. I’d rather die than kill the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those words were spoken from Beck’s home studio. The day before, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick (also a former radio host) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/1242245135129346050"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; something similar on Fox News to Tucker Carlson, who was &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/tucker-carlson-on-how-he-brought-coronavirus-message-to-mar-a-lago"&gt;broadcasting&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; home studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My message: Let’s get back to work, let’s get back to living, let’s be smart about it, and those of us who are 70-plus, we’ll take care of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is not how the pattern of sacrifice will be felt in real life. The Trump administration still has not built an effective testing-and-tracing system, almost half a year after the president received his first formal warning about the pandemic in his daily intelligence brief on January 3.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus as Americans know it is not an equal-opportunity killer. The research arm of American Public Media &lt;a href="https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on April 17 that 27 percent of those killed by COVID-19 to date have been African American, more than twice their share of the population. Grocery workers are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/12/grocery-worker-fear-death-coronavirus/"&gt;dying&lt;/a&gt; in the dozens, at least 41 as of April 12, according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, with thousands more fallen sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the lockdown rules adopted by most states in March, coronavirus deaths per day are projected to subside to below 1,000 by May 1, from the more than 2,000 a day of mid-April. If the lockdown continues a little longer, that number could tumble to below 100 a day by mid-May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Our pandemic summer&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to look at casualties as numbers on the curve is to misunderstand what the Fox talkers and the Trump donors are telling us. The political calculus of Trump’s Plan A depends less on containing the total number of casualties than on confining the casualties to people deemed expendable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A story from South Dakota is pertinent here. The state’s governor, Kristi Noem, resisted stay-in-place orders for her low-density state. As she said, “South Dakota is not New York City.” Then the state was hit by an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/17/837530494/workers-advocate-says-south-dakota-pork-plant-delayed-action-on-coronavirus?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;outbreak&lt;/a&gt; at a Sioux Falls pork-packing plant: 634 cases among employees, plus hundreds more among those employees’ “contacts,” principally their relatives. Yet the Smithfield-plant outbreak &lt;a href="https://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/state-and-regional/noem-refuses-banning-evictions-utility-shutoffs-rejects-shelter-in-place-request/article_d05d9af8-0c1d-5809-b281-2ca4ceb41cff.html#tracking-source=home-top-story?mod=article_inline"&gt;has not changed&lt;/a&gt; Noem’s approach. The plant’s workforce, the BBC &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52311877"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, was “made up largely of immigrants and refugees from places like Myanmar, Ethiopia, Nepal, Congo and El Salvador”—not Republican voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if the calculus of Plan A is wrong? What if reopening leads to a surge in deaths that cannot be politically contained? In that case, Trump reverts to his Plan B: a culture war against Democratic governors and blue states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 16, Trump tweeted “Liberate Michigan!” in apparent support of protesters who blocked traffic around the state legislature in Lansing. To date, the great majority of Americans support the lockdown, according to &lt;a href="https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/16/most-americans-say-trump-was-too-slow-in-initial-response-to-coronavirus-threat/"&gt;polling&lt;/a&gt; by Pew. Twice as many fear that the lockdown will be ended too early than those who worry it will be ended too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of this decisive opposition to the president’s wishes, the president’s supporters are borrowing the tactics of the early Tea Party. They are protesting in aggressively obnoxious ways to entice the TV cameras to overlook their tiny numbers and fringe membership: Confederate-flag wavers, militia cosplayers, anti-vaxxers. The Lansing protesters used their cars to impede ambulances. They brandished guns on the steps of the legislature. Behave obnoxiously enough, and the television cameras will disregard your scanty numbers. The Lansing protests have been joined by even smaller protests in &lt;a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/demonstrators-gather-in-huntington-beach-to-protest-states-stay-at-home-order-and-defying-social-distancing-rules/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article241999131.html"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, each numbering fewer than 100 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/conservative-campaign-security/608986/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Lawrence Glickman: The conservative campaign against safety&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, America’s most powerful cable-news network is more than a passive victim of disinformation. As with the Tea Party a decade ago, so now with the anti-lockdown protests: Fox News acts as the co-author of the pseudo-events staged for its cameras, as in this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/existentialfish/status/1251497219628445696"&gt;fanciful graphic&lt;/a&gt; showing half the United States colored red in protest, as if the whole country were aflame rather than a few hundred oddballs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Trump, it's win-win. Either he pushes the country to trade poor people’s lives for the pursuit of economic recovery, or he gets a cable-TV culture war to distract his supporters from the troubles he himself aggravated by his own negligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s bad leadership has inflicted terrible hardship on Americans. Trump’s Plan A is to use the pain of that hardship to justify more bad leadership. His Plan B is to use the pain as a way to shift odium: &lt;em&gt;Don’t blame me, the guy who failed to prepare for the pandemic. Blame the governors who are now forced to respond to my failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tools entrusted to the administration to protect the country are being used by the administration to protect the president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-sba-paycheck-protection-program/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on April 17 that small-business-relief funds are disproportionately flowing to red states, not blue ones. In South Carolina, 56 percent of small-business applications have been approved. In Texas, 58 percent have been approved. In Utah, 66 percent have been approved. In Kentucky, 69 percent. In Kansas, 79 percent. In Nebraska, 82 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington State, however, only 44.6 percent of applications for small-business aid have been approved. In New York State, only 40.1 percent. In California, only 38.4 percent. In the District of Columbia, only 30.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From his entry into presidential politics, Trump has divided Americans into first class, second class, and third class. He has continued that politics of division into this pandemic. On Saturday, Trump &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1251585447282847744"&gt;retweeted&lt;/a&gt; an ugly insinuation that state governments were favoring Muslim Ramadan observance over Easter worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The division is more than rhetorical. It shapes who gets economic assistance, who gets aid, and now, whose deaths are acceptable in order to put the country back to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life never can be risk-free. The reopening of the economy cannot wait for the discovery and distribution of a coronavirus vaccine. The job of our political leadership is to win acceptance of risk by undertaking that the accompanying benefits be shared. Trump’s noisy attacks on the cities and states that have suffered most—and his politics-first response—send the message that he’s acting in his self-interest, not the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Trump’s Plan A and Plan B intend to turn American against American, in an ugly spirit of rancor and resentment. In pandemic as in prosperity, the Trump way is to punish opponents, reward friends; accuse victims, protect culprits; demand credit, refuse accountability; protect preferred classes and groups of Americans—and sacrifice the rest.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Frum</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/david-frum/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/RTX7E5GA/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Alexander Drago / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Trump’s Two Horrifying Plans for Dealing With the Coronavirus</title><published>2020-04-19T12:13:30-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T15:59:32-04:00</updated><summary type="html">If he can’t confine the suffering to his opponents, he is prepared to incite a culture war to distract his supporters.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/trump-trading-lives-poor-economic-growth/610264/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610225</id><content type="html">&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":18,"w":672,"h":22,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2290}'&gt;&lt;em bis_size='{"x":75,"y":19,"w":166,"h":19,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2291}'&gt;&lt;small bis_size='{"x":75,"y":20,"w":166,"h":18,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2292}'&gt;Updated at 11:45 a.m. E.T.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":56,"w":672,"h":176,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2328}'&gt;BERLIN—Today, we face the global outbreak of a disease that has the potential to catalyze what the historian Eva Schlotheuber terms a “pandemic of the mind.” As &lt;a bis_size='{"x":75,"y":101,"w":206,"h":19,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2373}' href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/08/influencers-being-key-distributors-of-coronavirus-fake-news"&gt;misinformation proliferates&lt;/a&gt; and lines between fact and fiction are routinely and nonchalantly &lt;a bis_size='{"x":179,"y":123,"w":54,"h":19,"abs_x":371,"abs_y":2395}' href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/?utm_source=feed"&gt;crossed&lt;/a&gt;, world leaders must, now more than ever, illuminate a thoughtful path forward, one reliant on science and evidence-based reasoning. Indeed, many have. One leader goes further still. Trusted by her people to navigate this outbreak’s murky waters, without inciting or succumbing to a pandemic of the mind, one politician is less a commander in chief and more a scientist in chief: Angela Merkel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":248,"w":672,"h":264,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2520}'&gt;For weeks now, Germany’s leader has deployed her characteristic rationality, coupled with an uncharacteristic sentimentality, to guide the country through what has thus far been a relatively successful battle against COVID-19. The pandemic is proving to be the crowning challenge for a politician whose leadership style has consistently been described as analytical, unemotional, and cautious. In her quest for social and economic stability during this outbreak, Merkel enjoys several advantages: a well-respected, coordinated system of scientific and medical expertise distributed across Germany; the hard-earned trust of the public; and the undeniable fact that steady and sensible leadership is suddenly back in style. With 30 years of political experience, and facing an enormous challenge that begs calm, reasoned thinking, Merkel is at peak performance modeling the humble credibility of a scientist at work. And it seems to be paying off, both politically and scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":528,"w":672,"h":22,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2800}' data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a bis_size='{"x":85,"y":529,"w":590,"h":19,"abs_x":277,"abs_y":2801}' href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-leadership-coronavirus/610237/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: New Zealand’s prime minister may be the most effective leader on the planet&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":566,"w":672,"h":286,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2838}'&gt;Born in West Germany in 1954, Merkel was raised in a small East German town to the north of Berlin. Her father was a Lutheran pastor and a target of surveillance by East Germany’s security service, the Stasi. A brilliant student, Merkel learned early on “not to put herself in the center of things” lest she expose herself or her family to undue scrutiny, according to Stefan Kornelius, her official biographer and the foreign editor of the &lt;em bis_size='{"x":104,"y":677,"w":149,"h":19,"abs_x":296,"abs_y":2949}'&gt;Süddeutsche Zeitung&lt;/em&gt; newspaper. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Merkel, who had by then earned a doctorate in quantum chemistry, was working as a research scientist. Soon after, she left her job to join a new political group that had formed in her neighborhood, thus quietly launching her political career. She rose in German politics and, through sheer smarts and a series of well-timed tactical maneuvers, ascended in 2005 to the chancellery, the head of Germany’s federal government. Her trajectory was dramatic and uncommon—for a woman, for an East German, and for a trained scientist with no background in law or civil service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":868,"w":672,"h":110,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3140}'&gt;Why did Merkel leave what appeared to be a promising career for the uncertainty of politics? In a &lt;em bis_size='{"x":176,"y":891,"w":90,"h":19,"abs_x":368,"abs_y":3163}'&gt;New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a bis_size='{"x":267,"y":891,"w":48,"h":19,"abs_x":459,"abs_y":3163}' href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/01/quiet-german"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; of her, George Packer called the decision “the central mystery of an opaque life.” Kornelius attributes the drastic change to a realization that, as a scientist from poorer and under-resourced East Germany, she would be “outpaced” by her western peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":994,"w":672,"h":198,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3266}'&gt;Merkel has never spoken publicly about why she left science, but perhaps that is because it never really left her. Scientific thinking—her deliberate probing of each new bit of information, her cautious consultation with experts—remains integral to Merkel’s daily decision-making process and her political persona. She is undoubtedly aware that her measured, modest handling of Germany’s affairs is at least partially why she has, for almost 15 years now, enjoyed the support of a country whose historical reverence for scientific achievement and great minds (think Kant, Einstein, innumerable others) is forever balanced by an acute wariness of charismatic leaders with big ideas (think Hitler).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":1208,"w":672,"h":132,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3480}'&gt;Prior to the pandemic, Merkel’s political star had been &lt;a bis_size='{"x":493,"y":1209,"w":55,"h":19,"abs_x":685,"abs_y":3481}' href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-07/merkel-s-fading-power-laid-bare-as-german-ministers-go-rogue"&gt;waning&lt;/a&gt;. She had become known, according to Kornelius, as the chancellor “who avoided things, much less as the one who built things.” Yes, she had prevented Europe from falling apart during the financial crisis and led the continent as it grappled with the subsequent migration crisis. But of late, she had been left politically sidelined by the domestic rise of populism, the far right, the far left, and by autocratic leaders around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":1356,"w":672,"h":220,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3628}'&gt;Then came the coronavirus. Germany’s first case was &lt;a bis_size='{"x":479,"y":1357,"w":77,"h":19,"abs_x":671,"abs_y":3629}' href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2020/jan/28/coronavirus-first-death-in-beijing-as-us-issues-new-china-travel-warning-live-updates"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; on January 28, but the threat didn’t truly transform everyday life here until the middle of March. Government-mandated restrictions in Berlin were incremental but more and more disruptive. Few were bothered by the cancellation of large gatherings such as industry conferences, but when the city’s creative centers—its theaters, operas, and concert halls—closed on March 10, something essential &lt;a bis_size='{"x":313,"y":1467,"w":98,"h":19,"abs_x":505,"abs_y":3739}' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/theater/theater-streaming-online-schaubuehne-muenchner-kammerspiele.html"&gt;went missing&lt;/a&gt;. A few days later, Berlin’s notorious and celebrated nightlife scene went dark too. Pedestrians dispersed, spooked restaurant owners closed up shop or erected plexiglass barriers. The very fabric of the capital’s social and cultural life was fraying. Residents of this once-divided city were again reminded just how quickly freedom can be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":1592,"w":672,"h":88,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3864}'&gt;Merkel—for whom, as a former East German, liberty and freedom are known to be paramount—understood all too personally what the lockdown meant for her fellow citizens. On March 18, after the country had closed its schools, its economy, its way of life, she gave a rare televised &lt;a bis_size='{"x":292,"y":1659,"w":49,"h":19,"abs_x":484,"abs_y":3931}' href="https://youtu.be/F9ei40nxKDc"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; that solidified her leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":1696,"w":672,"h":220,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3968}'&gt;Facing the camera from behind a desk, with both the German and European Union flags to her side, she began on an emotional note, by conceding that “our idea of normality, of public life, social togetherness—all of this is being put to the test as never before.” She emphasized the importance of democracy and of making transparent political decisions and she insisted that any information she shared about the pandemic was based on thorough research. Then, in an astonishing &lt;a bis_size='{"x":511,"y":1807,"w":73,"h":19,"abs_x":703,"abs_y":4079}' href="https://video.bundesregierung.de/2020/03/18/a6eqjk-20200318_a-master.mp4"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; for a German leader, one she “must have considered endlessly," Kornelius told me, she made reference to her country’s darkest hour. “Since the Second World War,” Merkel said, “there has not been a challenge for our country in which action in a spirit of solidarity on our part was so important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":1696,"w":672,"h":220,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":3968}' data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/underlying-conditions/610261/?utm_source=feed"&gt;George Packer: We are living in a failed state&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":1970,"w":672,"h":286,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":4242}'&gt;What stood out from the address was not so much Merkel’s medical advice, but her unusually direct appeal to the notion of social togetherness and to her own limitations as an individual and as a leader (“I firmly believe that we will pass this test if all citizens genuinely see this as their task”). Her rational assurances and her emotional appeal were crucial at a time of rising panic. While the mood isn’t quite so dark here anymore—thanks to a variety of factors, Germany appears to have dealt with the outbreak better than many other countries—Germans largely continue to heed the chancellor’s &lt;a bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2103,"w":670,"h":41,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":4375}' href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/statement-chancellor-1733322"&gt;detailed directives&lt;/a&gt;. The number of people infected by the coronavirus has increased, as it has throughout the world. But unlike in Italy, where more than 22,000 have lost their life to COVID-19, or in the United States, where the death toll has surpassed that figure and continues to rise rapidly, total deaths in Germany have been inching up from 4,000. To put this in perspective, more than twice as many New Yorkers have lost their life to the coronavirus as have individuals in all of Germany to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2272,"w":672,"h":176,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":4544}'&gt;While country-level comparative data may be &lt;a bis_size='{"x":427,"y":2273,"w":155,"h":19,"abs_x":619,"abs_y":4545}' href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/fog-pandemic/608764/?utm_source=feed"&gt;somewhat unreliable&lt;/a&gt;, and the numbers can certainly take a turn for the worse in Germany as anywhere else, experts cite a number of &lt;a bis_size='{"x":161,"y":2317,"w":114,"h":19,"abs_x":353,"abs_y":4589}' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html"&gt;possible factors&lt;/a&gt; for the country’s relatively low number of deaths: The average age of coronavirus patients has been lower here than elsewhere, which limits the risk; the number of people &lt;a bis_size='{"x":282,"y":2361,"w":43,"h":19,"abs_x":474,"abs_y":4633}' href="https://www.ft.com/content/849308f8-75bc-11ea-ad98-044200cb277f"&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt; for the virus is higher than in other countries, and cases are for the most part carefully tracked; and the public health-care system has been efficient enough to &lt;a bis_size='{"x":223,"y":2405,"w":64,"h":19,"abs_x":415,"abs_y":4677}' href="https://www.ft.com/content/d979c0e9-4806-4852-a49a-bbffa9cecfe6"&gt;ramp up&lt;/a&gt; the number of available intensive-care units to meet potential demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2464,"w":672,"h":110,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":4736}'&gt;Given her longevity, any resulting successes are at least in some degree attributable to Merkel’s leadership. The chancellor has a way of bringing “divergent interests together in compromise,” Kornelius said. Her ability to admit what she doesn’t know, and delegate decisions, has been a particularly good fit for post-war Germany’s federalized political structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2590,"w":672,"h":198,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":4862}'&gt;Merkel has relied on experts from well-funded scientific-research organizations, including public-health agencies such as the Robert Koch Institute and the country’s network of public universities. The Berlin Institute of Health, a biomedical-research institution, has, like other organizations, recently &lt;a bis_size='{"x":454,"y":2657,"w":131,"h":19,"abs_x":646,"abs_y":4929}' href="https://www.bihealth.org/en/notices/what-cells-does-the-novel-coronavirus-attack/"&gt;pivoted its efforts&lt;/a&gt; in order to study the coronavirus. Its chairman, Axel Radlach Pries, told me that Germany’s research institutions are currently working closely together to “establish nationwide systems” of research. The federal government, with Merkel at the helm, plays a convening role, recently gathering all of the country’s university medical departments into a &lt;a bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2745,"w":628,"h":41,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":5017}' href="https://www.charite.de/en/the_charite/themen/coronavirus_sars_cov_2_charite_coordinates_network_of_academic_medical_research_into_covid_19/"&gt;single coronavirus task force&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2804,"w":672,"h":264,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":5076}'&gt;When I spoke with him, Pries stressed the significance of receiving honest communication from the highest levels of leadership during the outbreak. Merkel has relied heavily, and very publicly, on the expertise of a handful of experts, including the &lt;a bis_size='{"x":75,"y":2871,"w":92,"h":19,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":5143}' href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/823865329/das-coronavirus-podcast-captivates-germany-with-scientific-info-on-the-pandemic"&gt;now famous&lt;/a&gt; Christian Drosten, the head of virology at the Charité hospital in Berlin. From the perspective of the public, Pries said, the chancellor and the virologist “are very trustworthy.” People know “that what they get from both Drosten and Angela Merkel are real and very well-considered facts” and that the two also “share information about what they &lt;em bis_size='{"x":155,"y":2959,"w":34,"h":19,"abs_x":347,"abs_y":5231}'&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; know.” Because they are “honest with respect to their information,” he said, that information is seen as credible. This honesty, at a time of widespread disinformation, Pries told me, was playing a big role in persuading Germans to largely continue to follow the rules and maintain, even now, “a very calm situation in Germany.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":3084,"w":672,"h":132,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":5356}'&gt;The virus is still far from defeated, and no one knows what challenges lie ahead for Germany, or the rest of the world. But judging by Merkel’s approach—her rigor in collating information, her honesty in stating what is not yet known, and her composure—she may someday be remembered not as Germany’s greatest scientist, but as its scientist in chief: the political leader who executed, celebrated, and personified evidence-based thinking when it mattered most.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saskia Miller</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/saskia-miller/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/DANX6P_toned/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Michael Kappeler / DPA / Alamy</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Angela Merkel’s Scientific Background Could Save Germany</title><published>2020-04-20T02:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T15:34:50-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The chancellor’s rigor in collating information, her honesty in stating what is not yet known, and her composure are paying off.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/04/angela-merkel-germany-coronavirus-pandemic/610225/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610192</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note:&lt;/em&gt; Every Monday, Lori Gottlieb &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/category/dear-therapist/"&gt;answers questions from readers&lt;/a&gt; about their problems, big and small. Have a question? Email her at &lt;a href="mailto:dear.therapist@theatlantic.com"&gt;dear.therapist@theatlantic.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Therapist,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My older sister and I have an okay relationship. She likely had ADHD as a child, and she had aggressive outbursts that made me not want to spend time with her when we were younger. As adults, our relationship is not sisterly, because I feel like her caregiver. She has bad anxiety, and because of grad school, she developed a panic disorder that involves frequent panic attacks. She expects me to console and calm her, and I have tried, but it’s exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I’ve moved out of state, and she’s not handling the coronavirus outbreak well (who is?). She messages or calls me while I’m working at home to tell me how overwhelmed she is and how she’ll never finish her work to-do lists. I have tried to tell her to bring this up with her therapist; to not expect so much of herself during this time; to explain to her boss what she’s going through and ask for help; and to recognize that no one expects everything to be done perfectly or on time right now. But she has excuses for why none of that will work. She will message me the exact same complaints the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of our tense childhood, she takes any boundaries or silence as complete rejection of her as a person, or says that I don’t take her mental illness seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I myself haven’t seen a therapist since college, and at the time, I was diagnosed with depression. But I never addressed it. I’d like to now, but I am having a hard time making myself follow through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I tell her to limit how much she puts on me? Or should I accept that in order to help her through her mental-illness journey, this is what is required of me? How can I balance that with my own needs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anonymous&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gaithersburg, Md.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Anonymous,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are challenging times, and you, like so many, are doing your best to cope with the coronavirus outbreak. Even so, I can imagine that feeling obligated to manage your sister’s anxiety only adds to the difficulty. The good news is that living through this moment might help you see something about your relationship with your sister that was harder to see during normal times: namely, that your sister was never the only one struggling with her condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I mean is this: Mental-health conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, addiction, and schizophrenia shape the dynamics of an entire family. Sometimes the person with the condition is a parent, and this affects not only that person’s partner, but also his or her children. Other times the person with the condition is a child, and this affects the child’s parents as well as any siblings. Each family member will feel a range of emotions that might include worry, anger, helplessness, dread, or resentment, and each will respond in his or her own way. One person might try to “save” the struggling family member, another might avoid getting too close or even completely disengage, while another might stuff down her own needs and feelings in order to be “easy” and not add to the family’s collective stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/a-therapists-guide-to-emotional-health-in-a-pandemic/608161/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Dear Therapist’s guide to staying sane during a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve your relationship with your sister in the present, you’ll need to consider what role you took on in the family dynamic, because these roles tend to persist into adulthood in some form, and when this happens, the now-adult sibling gets stuck. Any of these roles may have been adaptive while growing up—a child finds a way to cope—but they constrain the person as an adult. That might be why you’re asking whether you have a right to set boundaries, a right to protect your psyche, a right to consider your own needs—in short, a right to live your life and not your sister’s life for her. The child who felt like she had no alternative (&lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; didn’t choose to live in a house with this particular sibling) grows into an adult who has trouble seeing how free she has become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see the freedom you have now, start by exploring how growing up with your sister affected you and continues to do so. For instance, when she had “aggressive outbursts,” perhaps you felt scared, or angry, or unsafe. Maybe you felt invisible or neglected if your parents paid more attention to your sister because she took up so much air in the house, and if much of their energy was spent trying to help her while also managing their own complicated feelings toward her. Maybe whatever was going on in the house left you teetering between resenting your sister and feeling responsible for her well-being. And maybe all of this led you to question, even when you were diagnosed with depression, whether you deserve to be the focus of your own attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/what-does-social-distance-mean-within-a-family/608044/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Coronavirus risk doesn’t stop at your front door&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You say that you want to address your depression now but are having a hard time following through. Do you notice how you sound a bit like your sister here? When you tell her, “Here’s what might help,” she makes excuses—just like you do when you tell yourself that seeing a therapist might help. Then you both continue to complain that nothing’s changing. And it’s not, because you’re both stuck in your childhood roles: hers as a helpless person with anxiety, yours as the helpless sister of a person with anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of shedding our family identities is that it frees us up to become who we actually are. But to get there, we have to accept some basic truths, the first of which is that this freedom comes with responsibility—we are all responsible for our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that you can’t take away another person’s mental-health condition, no matter how much you care about them. You can only offer your love and supportive suggestions (just once, not repeatedly), and it’s up to your sister what she chooses to tell her therapist, her boss, or even herself about her perceived lack of agency. It’s up to your sister to decide whether she wants to see a psychiatrist for a medication consultation, or to be kinder to herself if she doesn’t get all of her work done during a global pandemic, or to reach out to other friends for support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/how-coronavirus-caused-hug-and-handshake-hiatus/607762/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: When keeping your distance is the best way to show you care&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, it’s up to you whether you choose to say something to her like “I love you very much, and I do take your pain seriously. But I also believe that you’re very capable and strong and smart, so there’s nothing I can tell you that you don’t already know about what might help you feel better right now. I find these conversations as draining as you find your anxiety to be, and because I care about the quality of our relationship, from now on I’m going to end a call or not respond to a text when you bring this to me, because it doesn’t serve either of us.” And then it’s up to you to manage your own feelings when you disappoint her (and you will)—perhaps with the help of a therapist, or a support group for siblings of people with mental-health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strikes me most about your letter is that you describe your sister’s reaction to the coronavirus outbreak without once mentioning your own. Yes, she deserves compassion and understanding, but so do you. The more you can free yourself by becoming the adult that you are, the healthier your relationship with your sister—and yourself—will become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Therapist is for informational purposes only, does not constitute medical advice, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

These friends tell me they’re spending their day troubleshooting lessons given over videochat. When they aren’t standing over their kids’ shoulders showing them which math problem to do, they’re printing their worksheets or scanning them to send back to the teacher. It’s exhausting for parents with one kid, but with three or four, it’s practically impossible. Many of these parents have told me they’ve ended the day in tears—or spent the entire day in tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The frustrations of these moms echo those of an Israeli mother of four who recently went viral in a screaming, pleading video to teachers, recorded in her car. She told the camera, “Listen. It’s not working … this distance-learning thing. It’s impossible!” She was “falling to pieces,” she said. “If we don’t die of corona, we’ll die of distance learning … Please. Turn it down. Foot off the gas. Leave them be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It’s a fine message for teachers and administrators who are working around the clock to create ad hoc curricula with absolutely no notice. But it’s not necessary for parents to plead with teachers to ease up on the gas. Parents can, and should, simply opt out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2020/04/how-remote-school-can-work-covid-19-pandemic/609895/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What teachers need to make remote learning work&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many school districts have attempted to shift schooling to home, but you cannot simply school at home. That’s why many homeschoolers call what they do “home education,” not homeschooling. Home education involves an understanding that children can learn while doing everyday tasks; baking can teach math, science, and home economics. Sitting on the couch reading &lt;em&gt;Charlotte’s Web&lt;/em&gt; to kids in grades five and three and kindergarten counts as “school.”  So does taking a nature walk and creating a nature journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a homeschool mother, I set my own curriculum and my own schedule. We have the flexibility to plan our schedule around baby and toddler naps, my work schedule, and the activities my children once did. My kids’ education is my responsibility, and it is designed to fit our family’s individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The situation into which almost every parent in America has now suddenly and unwillingly been thrust could not be more different. One-size-fits-all education barely works in a classroom, but it is completely unmanageable with kids spread out across their various households working independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Most kids aren’t going back to school this calendar year; school districts have already conceded as much, as have many universities. Parents are in this not just for a few weeks, but for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And is this how families want to be spending the next months? Sitting inside staring at a computer screen for six hours a day? Most adults have a hard time in online meetings for that long for one day; it’s completely unreasonable to expect it of a child for months on end. And it’s leading to behavior issues, too. On one recent Facebook thread about screen time–generated outbursts, one mother wrote, “This is a major conflict in our family because we do not believe in this amount of screen time, and the kids thrive without it. Yet it is expected in order for online learning to occur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2020/04/special-education-goes-remote-covid-19-pandemic/610231/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The pandemic is a crisis for students with special needs&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Schools can still play a constructive role, even if they aren’t holding online classes for kids stuck in their homes. Instead of spending time on online lessons and hours of videochats, schools need to provide a crash course in education for parents, provide loose individual lesson plans and suggestions, and operate as a help line. When I chose home education for my children, I had the benefit of years of reading about educational theory and philosophy and best practices, in anticipation of teaching my children when they became school-age. Parents across the country have been thrown into the deep end of the pool, and they could use much more support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Parents, teachers, and administrators need to understand the unique nature of education at home. Every family looks different and has different needs. Some children have no siblings; some have many. Some children have parents who don’t speak English as a first language, but who could provide instruction much more easily in their native languages. Some families have two working parents trying to fit in school with their kids. Some families have an out-of-work parent because of the financial crisis that has resulted from this pandemic. What would be the best use of a kid’s time in the next few weeks and months? If an out-of-work restaurant chef is now home with his kids, will they gain more if he helps them do busywork problems in math, or if he teaches them how to cook?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The next few months will radically alter how parents think about the education of their children. For the time being, they are responsible for it. That’s why it’s time for parents to take charge of their kids’ schooling. Parents, not teachers or administrators, are the ones in the trenches—and so parents, not teachers or administrators, need to set the schedule and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bethany Mandel</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/bethany-mandel/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/h_15338978/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>LAM YIK FEI / The New York Times​ / Redux</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Distance Learning Isn’t Working</title><published>2020-04-20T06:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T10:17:30-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Instead of trying to move classes online, schools should support parents in educating their children.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/just-give-distance-learning/610222/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-609940</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; is making vital coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers.

In February, hindered by an &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-have-been-tested-coronavirus/607597/?utm_source=feed"&gt;unexpected failure to roll out diagnostic tests&lt;/a&gt; and an administration that had &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/05/white-house-loses-global-health-security-lead-as-a-new-ebola-outbreak-hits/560195/?utm_source=feed"&gt;denuded itself of scientific expertise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-are-sick-lost-february/608521/?utm_source=feed"&gt;the nation sat largely idle&lt;/a&gt; while the pandemic spread within its borders. In March, as the virus launched several simultaneous assaults on a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-forcing-american-hospitals-ration-care/609004/?utm_source=feed"&gt;perilously stretched-thin health-care system&lt;/a&gt;, America finally sputtered into action, frantically closing offices, schools, and public spaces in a bid to cut off chains of transmission. Now, in April, as viral fevers surge through American hospitals and cabin fever grows in American homes, the U.S. has cemented itself as the new center of the pandemic—the country that should have been more prepared than any other, but that now has the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What will May bring? Or June? What happens as this seemingly interminable spring rolls into a precarious summer? &lt;em&gt;When will things go back to normal&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/?utm_source=feed"&gt;options are limited&lt;/a&gt;. Early inaction left the U.S. with too many new cases, and just one recourse: Press a societal pause button to buy enough time for beleaguered hospitals to steel themselves for a sharp in&lt;a id="1" name="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;flux in patients. This physical-distancing strategy is working, but at &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/economy-ruined-it-didnt-have-be-way/609334/?utm_source=feed"&gt;such an economic cost&lt;/a&gt; that it can’t be sustained indefinitely. When restrictions relax, as they are set to do on April 30, the coronavirus will likely surge back, as it is now doing in &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-asian-countries-that-beat-covid-19-have-to-do-it-again/"&gt;Singapore, China, and other Asian states&lt;/a&gt; that had briefly restrained it.&lt;a href="#2"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How the pandemic will end&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/?utm_source=feed"&gt;As I wrote&lt;/a&gt; last month, the only viable endgame is to play whack-a-mole with the coronavirus, suppressing it until a vaccine can be produced. With luck, that will take 18 to 24 months. During that time, new outbreaks will probably arise. Much about that period is unclear, but the dozens of experts whom I have interviewed agree that life as most people knew it cannot fully return. “I think people haven’t understood that this isn’t about the next couple of weeks,” said Michael Osterholm, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. “This is about the next two years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The pandemic is not a hurricane or a wildfire. It is not &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/05/surgeon-general-pearl-harbor-moment-165729"&gt;comparable to Pearl Harbor or 9/11&lt;/a&gt;. Such disasters are confined in time and space. The SARS-CoV-2 virus will linger through the year and across the world. “Everyone wants to know when this will end,” said Devi Sridhar, a public-health expert at the University of Edinburgh. “That’s not the right question. The right question is: How do we continue?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. Reopening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A lockdown is a measure of last resort, to be used only when a virus is spreading so rapidly that it cannot be controlled through other means. Having deployed that measure, albeit unevenly, the U.S. has now bought itself some time. It can use that time to address its lack of tests and medical supplies, and find less economically devastating ways of controlling COVID-19. When sufficiently braced, states could begin lifting their sweeping restrictions and focus on finding and helping people who are actually infected. But the conditions for making that switch are not clear. “We’ve never faced a pandemic like this before in modern times, so we’re going to have to be flexible,” said Caitlin Rivers of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “There’s no real playbook.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The White House seems to be &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/06/americas-most-influential-coronavirus-model-just-revised-its-estimates-downward-not-every-model-agrees/"&gt;relying heavily on one mathematical model&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Washington that, in its first incarnation, was criticized for &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/data-science/"&gt;failing to accurately predict death rates&lt;/a&gt; even a day or two out. (While traditional models simulate how a disease spreads through virtual communities, this one simply made predictions based on death numbers in the U.S. and death rates in other countries.) “When we make weather predictions or plan for hurricanes, we don’t just plan based on one thing,” said Natalie Dean, a statistician at the University of Florida. Alternative models are being built, but in the meantime, it’s hard to accurately forecast how long the current phase of the pandemic will last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="callout-placeholder" data-source="curated"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Absent any certainty, one &lt;a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2020/04/03/482613/national-state-plan-end-coronavirus-crisis/"&gt;group of health experts, led by Ezekiel Emanuel&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist and former adviser to the Obama administration, argues that stay-at-home orders must continue until at least May 20. &lt;a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/"&gt;Another team, led by Scott Gottlieb&lt;/a&gt;, a former FDA commissioner, suggests that states should relax their restrictions only after new case counts have fallen for 14 consecutive days. Currently, the U.S. is still averaging about 30,000 new confirmed cases every day. “My sense is that we haven’t turned the corner,” said Rivers, who is a co-author on Gottlieb’s road map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Both groups agree that before relaxing the guidelines on social distancing the U.S. urgently needs to expand its ability to test for the virus, and to shore up hospitals with sufficient supplies. These recommendations are sensible, but they hinge on the expectation that the U.S. can recover the ground it lost due to its early inaction. It might not be able to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-models-arent-supposed-be-right/609271/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Don’t believe the COVID-19 models&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For example, with help from private companies and academic institutions, the U.S. is certainly &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing#source-information-country-by-country"&gt;testing more people than it was before&lt;/a&gt;. Over the past week, &lt;a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily"&gt;about 145,000 people have been tested every day&lt;/a&gt;, according to the COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer collaboration spearheaded by &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. Those numbers look to rise even further, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/04/13/abbott-labs-live-up-coronavirus-testing-expectations/2941027001/"&gt;a new, rapid test from Abbott Laboratories&lt;/a&gt; that can deliver results in less than 15 minutes. But as testing capacity has grown, so has the pandemic. As my colleagues Robinson Meyer and Alexis Madrigal have reported, private labs have taken on more orders than they can fulfill, and are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/next-covid-19-testing-crisis/609193/?utm_source=feed"&gt;experiencing huge backlogs&lt;/a&gt;. Demand for tests has ballooned, fueled by a rise in actual infections and the fact that Donald Trump keeps &lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/despite-lack-testing-strategy-trump-seeks-congratulations-n1179531"&gt;wrongly &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://khn.org/news/donald-trumps-wrong-claim-that-anybody-can-get-tested-for-coronavirus/"&gt;assuring &lt;/a&gt;the public that testing is &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/31/coronavirus-larry-hogan-says-trumps-claims-testing-not-true/5093609002/"&gt;no longer a problem&lt;/a&gt;. “The net gain just hasn’t been there,” said Kelly Wroblewski of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Compounding these issues, testing companies all rely on the same chemical ingredients, which were already running low and &lt;a href="https://asm.org/Articles/Policy/2020/March/ASM-Expresses-Concern-about-Test-Reagent-Shortages"&gt;are becoming even scarcer&lt;/a&gt; as the pandemic spreads. “Trying to get these materials is not about dollars and cents; it’s about physics,” Osterholm said. “You can’t just buy these things. It takes time to make them.” To be clear, there is wide consensus that &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/we-need-1-million-tests-week/609154/?utm_source=feed"&gt;testing is crucial&lt;/a&gt; for working out where the virus is and adequately preparing for it. In an ideal reality, testing should be done extensively. But in this reality, Osterholm noted, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-testing-shortages.html"&gt;it might be several months&lt;/a&gt; before manufacturers can meet global demand. For the summer, the U.S. might have to abandon the dream that “everyone who gets sick is going to get a test and we’ll be able to count every case with a lab diagnosis,” Wroblewski said. “That might not be realistic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/next-covid-19-testing-crisis/609193/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Private labs are fueling a new coronavirus testing crisis&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Crucial medical drugs are also running out. According to a University of Minnesota analysis, about 40 percent of the &lt;a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/cidrap-finds-supply-chain-risks-availability-critical-drugs-during-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;156 drugs&lt;/a&gt; that are essential parts of critical care are becoming limited. Many of these depend on supply chains that involve China (where the pandemic began), Italy (the hardest-hit region in Europe), or India (which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/us-drug-shortage-fears-grow-as-india-locks-down-due-to-the-coronavirus.html"&gt;halted several exports&lt;/a&gt;). These chains have been discharging their contents like a sputtering garden hose that has now begun to run dry. “The medium term is going to be particularly perilous,” said Nada Sanders, a professor of supply-chain management at Northeastern University. “Global demand is so high, and supply is so far behind, that it’s very hard to envision enough of a ramp-up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-03-30/another-coronavirus-health-threat-too-few-asthma-inhalers"&gt;Albuterol&lt;/a&gt;, the drug used in asthma inhalers, is scarce. Antibiotics, which control the secondary bacterial infections that afflict COVID-19 patients, are being depleted. Basic painkillers and sedatives, which are needed to keep patients on ventilators, are being exhausted. Hydroxychloroquine, the drug that Trump has repeatedly touted as a COVID-19 treatment &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/hydroxychloroquine-trump/609547/?utm_source=feed"&gt;despite a lack of good evidence&lt;/a&gt;, is running out, to the detriment of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/07/health/hydroxychloroquine-shortage-lupus-arthritis/index.html"&gt;people with lupus and arthritis&lt;/a&gt; who depend on it. “It’s like everything we give to patients, we’re in short supply of,” said Esther Choo, an emergency physician at Oregon Health and Science University. “We’re now scrambling to find the backup medications, and we’ll run out of those too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/save-hydroxychloroquine-people-like-me/609865/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Maya L. Harris: Some patients really need the drug that Trump keeps pushing&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-20-00300.pdf"&gt;hospitals are still struggling&lt;/a&gt;. There &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/why-were-running-out-of-masks-in-the-coronavirus-crisis/609757/?utm_source=feed"&gt;aren’t enough masks&lt;/a&gt; and gowns to adequately protect staff, ventilators to deliver oxygen to patients who can’t breathe, or respiratory technicians and nurses to operate those ventilators. Overwhelmed and underprotected, doctors and nurses are falling sick. In Michigan, more than &lt;a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-health-watch/detroit-hospital-734-employees-have-tested-positive-coronavirus"&gt;700 employees at one hospital have tested positive&lt;/a&gt; for the coronavirus; at another, &lt;a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-health-watch/beaumont-has-1500-workers-coronavirus-symptoms-including-500-nurses"&gt;1,500 are out of work&lt;/a&gt; with consistent symptoms. Hospitals are now bringing back &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/local/309/2020/03/23/820158158/how-many-retired-doctors-nurses-will-answer-pritzker-s-call-to-action"&gt;retired physicians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/covid-19-states-call-early-medical-school-grads-bolster-workforce"&gt;graduating medical students early&lt;/a&gt;, and re-tasking &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-doctors.html"&gt;orthopedists and dermatologists&lt;/a&gt; to emergency rooms to help with the coronavirus surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Even if cases abate in the summer, exhausted health-care workers will have to catch up on &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/03/patients-whose-surgeries-are-canceled-because-coronavirus/608176/?utm_source=feed"&gt;elective surgeries that were postponed&lt;/a&gt; because of the pandemic (and that are important to a hospital’s financial survival), while also treating people who delayed getting help for &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/well/live/coronavirus-doctors-hospitals-emergency-care-heart-attack-stroke.html"&gt;heart problems&lt;/a&gt;, cancers, and other emergencies. “Patients are putting off health concerns that really need to be seen, and they’re coming in sick,” Choo said. If the pandemic rebounds in the fall, health-care workers may have to greet it without having had a summertime respite. Hospital disaster plans “are all structured around a single discrete event that is over pretty quickly,” Choo said. “We don’t expect our diseases to be stuttering.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These problems—the continuing testing debacle, the drying supply chains, the relentless pressure on hospitals—should temper any impatience about reopening the country. There won’t be an obvious moment when everything is under control and regular life can safely resume. Even after case counts and death rates fall, the pandemic’s challenges will continue, and will not automatically subside on their own. After all, despite ample warning, the U.S. failed to anticipate what would happen when the coronavirus knocked on its door. It cannot afford to make that mistake again. Before the spring is over, it needs a plan for the summer and fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II. Recalibration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There’s good reason to reopen the U.S. slowly and methodically. When the pandemic first hit, a wide range of social-distancing measures—closing offices, shutting schools, banning mass gatherings, implementing stay-at-home orders—were rolled out in a sudden panic. The rushed deployment was necessary, but made it hard to know which measures actually mattered. The next few months offer opportunities to find out. Communities could relax restrictions gradually, and see if the virus remains at a simmer or returns to a boil. When the virus returns, political leaders should be able to make more informed decisions about which levers to flip. “We should absolutely be throwing everything we can to figure that out,” said Jessica Metcalf, an infectious-disease ecologist at Princeton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The most crucial piece of missing information, and the one that most dramatically shapes the nation’s options, is what proportion of people have actually been infected. So far, the U.S. has more than 576,000 confirmed cases. But between the lack of testing and the unknown proportion of people who experience mild or nonexistent symptoms, the true number of cases is anyone’s guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There’s an easy way to find out. When someone is infected, their immune system produces defensive molecules called antibodies, which recognize (and, with hope, neutralize) the virus. These antibodies endure after the infection is cleared, and should theoretically provide &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/coronavirus-immunity.html"&gt;some degree of lasting immunity&lt;/a&gt;. By detecting such antibodies through what are known as serological tests, scientists can deduce how many people have been infected in these past months. (Serological tests differ from diagnostic tests, which search for pieces of the coronavirus’s genetic material to work out who is infected right now.) Such “serosurveys” are ongoing, and while preliminary data have emerged, they don’t paint a clear picture yet. &lt;a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/germany-s-wuhan-has-15-per-cent-infection-rate-and-low-death-toll-1.1004050"&gt;In a German town&lt;/a&gt; that became a hot spot of the country’s outbreak in February, about 15 percent of people have been infected; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-tests-everyone-tiny-colorado-county/608590/?utm_source=feed"&gt;in a Colorado county&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sanmiguelcountyco.gov/590/Coronavirus"&gt;the figure stands&lt;/a&gt; between 0.4 and 1.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-covid-19-the-atlantics-most-crucial-coverage/607906/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What you need to know about the coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If it turns out that, say, 20 percent of the U.S. has been infected, that would mean the coronavirus is more transmissible but less deadly than scientists think. It would also mean that a reasonable proportion of the country has some immunity. If that proportion could be slowly and safely raised to the level necessary for herd immunity—60 to 80 percent, depending on the virus’s transmissibility—the U.S. might not need to wait for a vaccine. However, if just 1 to 5 percent of the population has been infected—the range that many researchers think is likelier—that would mean “this is a truly devastating virus, and we have built up no real population immunity,” said Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and immunologist at Harvard. “Then we’re in dire straits in terms of how to move forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Even in the optimistic scenario, a quick and complete return to normalcy would be ill-advised. And even in the pessimistic scenario, controlling future outbreaks should still be possible, but only &lt;a href="http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/a-national-plan-to-enable-comprehensive-COVID-19-case-finding-and-contact-tracing-in-the-US.pdf"&gt;through an immense public-health effort&lt;/a&gt;. Epidemiologists would need to run diagnostic tests on anyone with COVID-19–like symptoms, quarantine infected people, trace everyone those people had contact with in the previous week or so, and either quarantine those contacts or test them too. These are the standard pillars of public health, but they’re complicated by the coronavirus’s ability to spread for days before causing symptoms. Every infected person has a lot of potential contacts, and may have unknowingly infected many of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Tracking such a pathogen requires a lot of people, but due to chronic underfunding, local U.S. health departments &lt;a href="https://www.tfah.org/article/new-tfah-report-persistent-underfunding-of-americas-public-health-system-makes-the-nation-vulnerable-and-puts-lives-at-risk/"&gt;lost more than 55,000 workers&lt;/a&gt; from 2008 to 2017. In their absence, a corps of volunteers could be quickly trained in the basics of contact tracing, &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/03/contact-tracing-coronavirus-massachusetts-baker"&gt;as Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker is planning to do&lt;/a&gt;. “It might be an opportunity to bring in people who are recently unemployed—a wartime effort where people aren’t doing their normal jobs,” said Crystal Watson of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/contact-tracing-could-free-america-from-its-quarantine-nightmare/609577/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The technology that could free America from quarantine&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If there aren’t enough tests, as seems likely in the near term, health officials could focus their attention on looking for spikes in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/health/coronavirus-fever-thermometers.html"&gt;flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, or for less orthodox indicators such as &lt;a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/co/2014/04/mco2014040094/13rRUwcAqvu"&gt;crowded hospital parking lots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3692821/"&gt;restaurant cancellations&lt;/a&gt;. More controversially, they could quickly track an infected person’s contacts by &lt;a href="https://nexttrace.org/team"&gt;comparing their cellphone activity&lt;/a&gt; with that of others in the same area. As South Korea and Singapore demonstrated, such methods clearly work. They undoubtedly raise privacy concerns, but &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/contact-tracing-could-free-america-from-its-quarantine-nightmare/609577/?utm_source=feed"&gt;as my colleague Derek Thompson argues&lt;/a&gt;, “Compared with our present nightmare, strategically sacrificing our privacy might be the best way to protect other freedoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Once the U.S. gets better at tracking the coronavirus, it could use social distancing more flexibly and precisely. COVID-19 counts could feature on the nightly weather report, said Stephen Kissler, an infectious-disease modeler at Harvard. “In the same way that cities issue evacuation orders a few days before a hurricane hits, they could issue distancing orders a few days before we reach the threshold that would threaten to overwhelm our ICUs,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There’s a risk in trying to be too clever, though. Dylan Morris of Princeton, who also models infectious diseases, notes that &lt;a href="https://osf.io/rq5ct/"&gt;exponentially growing epidemics&lt;/a&gt; are not just harder, but riskier, to control. Slight delays in action can have huge consequences, as the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-pandemic-herd-immunity-uk-boris-johnson/608065/?utm_source=feed"&gt;United Kingdom learned last month&lt;/a&gt;. Relying too heavily on models, the British government believed that it could precisely control the spread of COVID-19 by rolling out social restrictions at carefully chosen moments. Its hubris led to a substantial spike in cases. Now that the U.S. is slowing the pandemic, gently easing back on social distancing would be safer, Morris argues, than snapping back to business as usual when small missteps could be catastrophic. “If we’re judicious about how we lift restrictions, we might never have to go back into lockdown,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-social-distancing-over-back-to-normal/608752/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The Four Possible Timelines for Life Returning to Normal&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Stay-at-home orders might lift first, allowing friends and family to reunite. Small businesses could reopen with limitations: Offices might run on shifts and still rely heavily on teleworking, while restaurants and bars could create more space between tables. Schools could restart once researchers determine if children actually spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This process might take several weeks to unfold, and even at the end of it, none of the experts I spoke with was comfortable with the return of crowded public spaces. Gottlieb’s road map, for example, recommends that until a vaccine or an effective treatment is produced, social gatherings should be limited to 50 people or fewer. That will be especially challenging in large cities: An average Manhattan street or subway car is the equivalent of a mass gathering. Elsewhere, concerts, conferences, summer camps, political rallies, large weddings, and major sporting events may all have to be suspended for at least this year. “It’s hard for me to imagine anyone going to Fenway Park and sitting with 30,000 fans—that will almost surely be a bad idea,” said Ashish Jha, an internist and public-health expert at Harvard. “This isn’t going to look like a normal summer in America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III. Reinforcements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During the long wait for a vaccine, other countermeasures could conceivably dampen the threat of COVID-19. The simplest of these is the face mask. Medical masks are still in short supply, and must be reserved for health-care workers. But &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html"&gt;homemade alternatives&lt;/a&gt; might help slow the spread of the coronavirus, less by preventing healthy wearers from getting infected and more by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2"&gt;stopping unknowingly sick wearers from infecting others&lt;/a&gt;. As I wrote earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-airborne-go-outside-masks/609235/?utm_source=feed"&gt;masks are symbols as well as shields&lt;/a&gt;. In East Asian countries, where they are widely worn, they signify civic-mindedness and conscientiousness. As their use grows in Western nations, they could send the message that society is collectively acting against a serious threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Effective treatments for the new coronavirus could also blunt the sting of future outbreaks. As &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/04/what-coronavirus-drug-will-look-like/609661/?utm_source=feed"&gt;my colleague Sarah Zhang reports&lt;/a&gt;, “More than 100 existing and experimental drugs are being tested against COVID-19.” But it’s unlikely that any of these would be an outright cure in the way that antibiotics can be for bacterial infections. (Antibiotics do not work against viruses.) That’s partly because viruses are simpler than bacteria, with fewer vulnerabilities to exploit. Viruses are also more likely than bacteria to actually destroy our cells; by the time symptoms appear, viruses have caused a lot of tissue damage that isn’t easily reversed. And they are more likely to trigger &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-cytokine-storm-immune-system.html"&gt;cytokine storms&lt;/a&gt;—massive overreactions from the immune system that cause more damage than the infections they are trying to clear. “It’s likely that a therapeutic would only provide incremental benefit over the backbone of supportive medical care,” said Luciana Borio, a physician who served in the National Security Council’s pandemic-preparedness office, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/05/white-house-loses-global-health-security-lead-as-a-new-ebola-outbreak-hits/560195/?utm_source=feed"&gt;which was largely disbanded in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Tamiflu, for example, shortens flu infections by just a day or two, and works best if taken before symptoms appear or shortly after. A similar drug would not obviate the need for a vaccine, or fully negate the coronavirus threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/04/what-coronavirus-drug-will-look-like/609661/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The best hopes for a coronavirus drug&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;More realistically, treatments might give critically ill patients a better chance of survival, or prevent some people with early symptoms from ever needing critical care at all. Either would be an important win. “If people are feeling cruddy at home, and [an anti–COVID-19 drug] can reduce their risk of progressing to hospitalization from 20 percent to 10 percent, that would feel like a massive home run,” Jha said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Even without antivirals, many COVID-19 patients will recover on their own. If they retain antibodies that confer lasting immunity against the coronavirus, they could conceivably be free to work, support health-care workers, or care for the elderly and other vulnerable groups. Several countries, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/10/fauci-coronavirus-immunity-cards-for-americans-are-being-discussed-178784"&gt;including the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, are now hoping to identify immune individuals with serology tests and affirm their status with “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/immunity-passports-could-speed-up-return-to-work-after-covid-19"&gt;immunity passports&lt;/a&gt;,” akin to the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/yellow-fever"&gt;yellow card&lt;/a&gt; that’s issued following a yellow-fever vaccination. But such a system faces many substantial problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;First, antibodies aren’t always effective at neutralizing viruses. If you picture the coronavirus as a car, an antibody might slash its tires, or just gum up its wipers—and simple serology tests can’t tell which. Second, even if the antibodies are the right kind, no one knows what concentration you’d need to confer immunity. “Even for diseases we’ve been studying for over 100 years, like whooping cough, we still don’t know what level of antibody would indicate that you’d be protected if you got reexposed,” said Sam Scarpino of Northeastern University, who studies infectious-disease dynamics. The only way to find out is through long studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Third, serological tests for the new coronavirus could be deeply misleading for individuals. Consider &lt;a href="http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/COVID-19/Serology-based-tests-for-COVID-19.html"&gt;the test produced by Cellex&lt;/a&gt;—the only one thus far with emergency use authorization from the FDA. The test has a 93.8 percent chance of correctly identifying people with antibodies against the new coronavirus, and a 95.6 percent chance of correctly identifying people who lack those antibodies. Those numbers sound great, but if only a minority of Americans have been infected, the test would return far more false positives than true ones. Put it this way: If you have a positive result, the odds that you actually have any relevant antibodies are roughly one in two if 5 percent of the U.S. has been infected, and just one in six if only 1 percent has been infected. Scientists can correct for these errors if they use serological tests to assess immunity in a population, but it’s much harder on a person-by-person basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Finally, any certificate that affords special status, like the ability to work while others are quarantined, will create incentives for people to deliberately infect themselves or game the system with counterfeits. Immunity passports would unfairly “favor individuals who didn’t comply with social distancing and got sick early on,” said Alexandra Phelan of Georgetown University, who works on legal and policy issues related to infectious diseases. And “the idea that there would be a midpoint where some people could resume the right to be citizens and others could not is effectively an apartheid system,” said Sharon Abramowitz, a consultant at UNICEF who studies community responses to pandemics. “It might serve specific public-health ends, but in this society would be very problematic.” History affirms that concern: &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/opinion/coronavirus-immunity-passports.html"&gt;When yellow fever hit the American South in the 19th century&lt;/a&gt;, “immunoprivilege” worsened existing forms of discrimination while creating new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Passports and antibody tests aside, it’s reasonable to assume that someone who recovers from COVID-19 would be less likely to get infected again (for some duration that is still unclear). “But we can’t assume that you won’t bring that virus to someone else,” said Mina, the Harvard immunologist. “I worry that a lot of employers are just assuming that having antibodies or having been infected means you’re good to get back to work.” A false sense of security could quicken the spread of the virus during future surges, especially if people ignore social-distancing orders on the mistaken belief that they are immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/how-many-americans-will-die-coronavirus/609175/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The interminable body count&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These problems might be surmountable. The U.S. is still a scientific and biomedical powerhouse. To marshal that power, it needs a massive, coordinated, government-led initiative to find the cleverest ways of controlling COVID-19—a modern-day Apollo program. No such program is afoot. Former Trump- and Obama-era officials have published detailed plans. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/4/6/21207338/elizabeth-warren-coronavirus-covid-19-recession-depression-presidency-trump"&gt;Elizabeth Warren is on her third iteration&lt;/a&gt;. But the White House either has no strategy or has chosen not to disclose it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Without a unifying vision, governors and mayors &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/how-do-you-win-war-when-your-government-abandons-you/609457/?utm_source=feed"&gt;have been forced to handle the pandemic themselves&lt;/a&gt;. Ludicrously, states are bidding against one another—and the federal government—for precious supplies. Six states still haven’t issued any &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/"&gt;kind of stay-at-home order&lt;/a&gt;, while those that moved late, such as Florida, &lt;a href="https://www.news965.com/news/data-shows-potential-covid-spread-from-florida-spring-breakers/xP0zcNlfm1vDRXsWoeUc3J/"&gt;may have seeded infections in the rest of the country&lt;/a&gt;. “A patchwork approach to fighting a pandemic is very dangerous,” said Jeremy Konyndyk of the Center for Global Development. “It’s a recipe for a response that’s less than the sum of its parts.” While &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/massachusetts-joins-new-york-new-jersey-connecticut-pennsylvania-delaware-and-rhode-islands"&gt;several states&lt;/a&gt; have created their &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/california-oregon-washington-announce-joint-plan-ease-social-distancing-restrictions-reopen-1497634"&gt;own coordinated groups&lt;/a&gt;, Konyndyk’s worry, shared by others, is that there are limits to what even the most capable state leaders can do without federal coordination. “We almost need to devise a public-health government in exile which can take on the responsibility of national coordination,” said Osterholm, the University of Minnesota epidemiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That responsibility would typically fall to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it has been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/04/an-interview-with-the-cdc-director-on-coronavirus-masks-and-an-agency-gone-quiet/"&gt;strangely silent&lt;/a&gt;. For almost a month, the CDC’s leaders have been absent from press briefings, and its supporters fear that its reputation has been tarnished. Local leaders are making hundreds of public-health decisions—should we close this park, or open that beach?—without consulting the nation’s top public-health agency. Jha said he regularly fields calls from mayors and governors who would normally ring the CDC. “People don’t know where to turn to for expertise,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV. Resilience &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During the Vietnam War, Vice Admiral James Stockdale spent seven years being tortured in a Hanoi prison. When asked about his experience, he noted that optimistic prison-mates eventually broke, as they passed one imagined deadline for release after another. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/how-talk-about-coronavirus/609118/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Stockdale’s strategy&lt;/a&gt;, instead, was to meld hope with realism—“the need for absolute, unwavering faith that you can prevail,” &lt;a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/media_topics/TheStockdaleParadox.html"&gt;as he put it&lt;/a&gt;, with “the discipline to begin by confronting the brutal facts, whatever they are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The U.S. needs to learn that lesson, but Trump is still behaving as if he’s engaged in a brief skirmish rather than a protracted siege. On &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1247900240155295745"&gt;April 8, before even the first pandemic peak had subsided, he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: “Once we OPEN UP OUR GREAT COUNTRY, and it will be sooner rather than later, the horror of the Invisible Enemy, except for those that sadly lost a family member or friend, must be quickly forgotten.” The enemy isn’t going anywhere. To forget it would be to beget further horror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 2018, when writing about &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-the-next-plague-hits/561734/?utm_source=feed"&gt;whether the U.S. was ready for the next pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, I noted that the country was trapped in a cycle of panic and neglect. It rises to meet each new disease, but then settles into complacency once the threat is over. With COVID-19, I fear that the U.S. might enter the neglect phase before the panic part is even finished. If the current shutdown succeeds in flattening the curve, sparing the health-care system and minimizing deaths, it will &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/theres-no-shame-in-overreacting-to-the-coronavirus/608140/?utm_source=feed"&gt;feel like an overreaction&lt;/a&gt;. Contrarians will use the diminished body count to argue that the panic was needless and that the public was misled. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/existentialfish/status/1247707885536268291?s=21"&gt;Some are already saying that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/race-and-blame/609946/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Ibram X. Kendi: Stop blaming black people for dying of the coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Others will divert responsibility from the country’s leaders and its institutions. “There’s a lot of victim-blaming in the U.S., which comes from that neoliberal perspective where it’s your fault if you have bad circumstances,” said Emily Brunson, an anthropologist at Texas State University. The virus is &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/can-you-get-coronavirus-grocery-store/608659/?utm_source=feed"&gt;disproportionately killing people in low-income jobs&lt;/a&gt; who don’t have the privilege of working from home, but who will nonetheless be shamed for not distancing themselves. The virus is &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-exposing-our-racial-divides/609526/?utm_source=feed"&gt;disproportionately killing black people&lt;/a&gt;, whose health had already been impoverished through centuries of structural racism, but who will nonetheless be &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/race-and-blame/609946/?utm_source=feed"&gt;personally blamed for their fate&lt;/a&gt;. The virus is &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/03/americas-ageism-crisis-is-helping-the-coronavirus/608905/?utm_source=feed"&gt;disproportionately killing elderly people&lt;/a&gt;, who had already been shunted to the fringes of society, but who will nonetheless be told to endure further loneliness so that everyone else can be freer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If that happens, the panic-neglect cycle will inevitably continue. The U.S. will miss the chance to reexamine how systemic failures of its health-care system &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/04/two-pandemics-us-coronavirus-inequality/609622/?utm_source=feed"&gt;left so many citizens vulnerable&lt;/a&gt;, or to put in place measures that might forestall another resurgence. It will get hammered by the same damn virus again, and be driven into more severe lockdowns. People will tire. Compliance will fall. The nation would lose its single most effective weapon against the pandemic—the willingness of its citizens to make individual sacrifices for the sake of all. It could forcibly quarantine uncooperative people or impose criminal penalties, but “we know from past outbreaks that criminalizing public-health responses makes people go underground, perpetuates stigma, and fractures society,” Phelan said. “For the marathon we’re facing, we need solidarity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Over the coming months, we need “to normalize COVID in the public psyche, and reinforce that this will be a part of our day-to-day lives,” said Kissler, the Harvard disease modeler. “Many people I've spoken with are aghast at the thought. We thirst for a swift and decisive 'victory.' But I'm reminded of images from World War II as people in London walked to work, briefcases in hand, against a backdrop of bombed-out buildings. I think we are in store for a similar period in history, as we learn to make greater peace with the world's chaos and our own mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/respect-old/607864/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Shai Held: The staggering, heartless cruelty toward the elderly&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This kind of psychological resilience already exists within large groups of people who have been marginalized during periods of normalcy, and who are now the most at-risk from the pandemic. Elderly people, for example, have been most frequently cast as a vulnerable group in need of protection. But “older people have been through a lot—the civil-rights movement, the women’s movement, the Cold War,” said Monica Schoch-Spana, a medical anthropologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “They are culture keepers, full of stories of how you get through major tragedies and upheavals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The disability community has also noted that, at a time when their health is in jeopardy and their&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/2020/4/4/21204261/coronavirus-covid-19-disabled-people-disabilities-triage"&gt; value is in question&lt;/a&gt;, abled people are struggling with a new normal that is their old normal—spatial confinement, unpredictable futures, social distance. “We know how to do community from afar, and how to organize from bed,” said Ashley Shew of Virginia Tech, who studies the intersection between technology and disability. “Instead of feeling this great vacuum, our social life hasn’t radically changed.” Disability scholars have written about “&lt;a href="https://dsq-sds.org/article/view/5824/4684"&gt;crip time&lt;/a&gt;”—a flexible attitude toward timekeeping that comes from uncertainty. “Everything I enter in my calendar has an asterisk in my mind,” Shew said. “Maybe it’ll happen, maybe it won’t, depending on my next cancer scan or what’s happening in my body. I already live in this world when I’m measuring in shorter increments, when my future has always been planned differently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the rest of the U.S. comes to terms with the same restless impermanence, it must abandon the question &lt;em&gt;When do we go back to normal?&lt;/em&gt; That outlook ignores the immense disparities in what different Americans experience as normal. It wastes the rare opportunity to reimagine what a fairer and less vulnerabl&lt;a id="2" name="2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;e society might look like. It glosses over the ongoing nature of the coronavirus threat. There is no going back. The only way out is through—past a turbulent spring, across an unusual summer, and into an unsettled year beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Podcast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to Ed Yong discuss this story on an episode of &lt;em&gt;Social Distance&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;’s guide to the pandemic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="no" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://player.megaphone.fm/ATL1194901348" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe to &lt;/em&gt;Social Distance &lt;em&gt;on &lt;a aria-describedby="slack-kit-tooltip" delay="150" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1502770015" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a aria-describedby="slack-kit-tooltip" delay="150" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/60YRpZwOSq0GPqGXrfpzut?si=v1You0IDRlSAkZrQrEAxEA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/how-to-listen/?utm_source=feed"&gt;How to Listen&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#1"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article previously stated that Hong Kong and Taiwan were experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases.

Before technology allowed us to alarm ourselves with up-to-the-minute information, public-health messages were communicated using a fundamental graphic medium: the poster. Produced and displayed on a massive scale, these posters used a variety of cultural, political, and psychological strategies to steer public behavior with eye-catching and sometimes shocking visuals. And while today’s medium provides options via Instagram that you can print yourself, the message for fighting disease remains uncomfortably the same: Cover your mouth when coughing, stay home when you’re sick, avoid crowds, and don’t poop in the communal stream. Timeless advice, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="997" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/01_nlm_nlmuid_101447458_img-1/26fd0d643.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;When influenza hit Chicago in September 1918, the city was just beginning to implement containment measures.

I have learned enough from Lofgren over the years to think it worth sharing his views. In his note, he alludes to the background of protests by the Tea Party movement soon after Barack Obama took office—and the “Brooks Brothers riot” of 2000. He has details on all these developments in his books. For those not around at the time, more context on the Brooks Brothers riot—designed to affect the recount of votes in Florida, during the Bush-versus-Gore presidential race—is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/11/15/its-insanity-how-brooks-brothers-riot-killed-recount-miami/"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for the record, today Mike Pence offered an explanation for Trump’s “LIBERATE” tweets that differs from the one Lofgren presents, below. Pence said that, far from inciting resistance, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/19/coronavirus-latest-news/#link-XJLLP7R35VA2HDLFIVDZJ7JRVY"&gt;tweets were intended to encourage governors to “safely and responsibly” reopen&lt;/a&gt; their states. Read the two interpretations, and judge which sounds more plausible to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lofgren writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you didn’t emphasize the crucial point of this whole street theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the standard prestige media presentation, the “spontaneous” protestors against COVID-19 restrictions in Michigan and elsewhere are presented thus: those salt-of-the-earth working folk, battered by economic hardship, who want their jobs back. However misguided, their motives generally aren’t questioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who could have imagined that they [included] neo-Confederates, NRA extremists, anti-vaxxer lunatics, and other fringe types [and that their organizers included groups that have been] funded in part by the Koch brothers and a Trump cabinet member, Betsy DeVos?

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="2"&gt;The all-too-convenient disturbances overwhelmingly resemble the totally-not-connected-to-the-&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;GOP Tea Party demonstrations that “spontaneously” irrupted in 2009 to stymie Obamacare, with the death panels and so forth. That particular street theater was ignited by CNBC ranter Rick Santelli and largely financed by the Koch brothers. [JF note: more background on Rick Santelli’s role in the Tea Party era &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/when-cnbc-created-the-tea-party"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="3"&gt;Street theater was pioneered by of the New Left in the 1960s, but since the Brooks Brothers riot of November 2000 it has become a mainstay of Astroturfed movements inspired by the GOP and funded by corporate moguls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="4"&gt;Trump’s encouragement of the demonstrators is even more bizarre than commonly depicted. Past examples (Lincoln, Ike in Little Rock, Kennedy in Mississippi, etc.) represented the national head of government reining in states seeking to illegally secede or deny U.S. constitutional rights to citizens. This is a unique case: the head of the national government egging on residents of the states to illegally impede their state governors from carrying out their lawful, necessary, and proper functions to maintain public safety in a health emergency. So much for “federalism” under the GOP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
...

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value="6"&gt;Republican street theater, maybe even (or perhaps especially) when it threatens public safety or human decency, seems always to act like catnip to the mainstream media, who invariably trot out the well-worn tropes of “economic anxiety.” The U.S. media have done an execrable job on this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, a reader on the West Coast writes about the long-term effects of today’s elected GOP officials condoning Trump’s behavior:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with your approach of keeping a record of what we know now about Trump, partly as a way to rebut future claims of ignorance. I wonder if you also considered the following variation on this approach—namely, framing Trump’s most egregious behaviors, characteristics, and episodes, and the GOP and conservative media responses to them—as things that would NOT warrant the end of a future presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, extrapolating from the GOP and conservative media response to Trump, a future presidency should NOT be in serious jeopardy if the president fails to a) reveal their tax forms, b) divest their business or put their assets into a blind trust, and c) explicitly uses their office for personal profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the following behaviors from a future president or presidential candidate are not only not disqualifying, but they would also not warrant a serious FBI investigation: a) publicly or privately asking a foreign power to intervene in an election, b) lying about contacts with such a foreign power during a campaign, c) discussing or coordinating campaign tactics … you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By turning a blind eye to Trump’s bad behavior, the GOP and Trump's conservative supporters are implicitly establishing the criteria for ending a presidency; and what they’ve been saying, in so many words, is that Trump’s behavior and overall fitness do not warrant the end of a presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, the points above should be explicit. Americans should know the GOP’s stance on this, and we should have a national discussion about what warrants the end of a presidency...&lt;/p&gt;

The presumptive Democratic nominee could slam Trump for &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html?action=click&amp;amp;amp;module=Spotlight&amp;amp;amp;pgtype=hinytmynameisben"&gt;ignoring&lt;/a&gt; his own advisers’ warnings about the potential severity of the virus. Biden could skewer the president for his administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/health/cdc-coronavirus-lab-contamination-testing.html"&gt;inability to develop&lt;/a&gt; a coronavirus test. He could blast the Trump administration for failing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/3/21206170/us-emergency-stockpile-jared-kushner-almost-empty-coronavirus-medical-supplies-ventilators"&gt;to adequately stockpile&lt;/a&gt; personal protective equipment. He could condemn the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/?utm_source=feed"&gt;large quantities of misinformation&lt;/a&gt; that Trump has propagated about the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the moment, however, Biden has chosen a different angle: He’s attacking Trump for knuckling under to Beijing. Yesterday, the Biden campaign &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/coronavirus-trump-china-biden-ad_n_5e9b2159c5b63639081f5d15"&gt;unveiled an ad&lt;/a&gt;—filled with menacing images of Chinese soldiers—claiming that “Trump rolled over for the Chinese.” It follows another &lt;a href="https://americanbridgepac.org/trump-china-trust/"&gt;spot&lt;/a&gt;, paid for by the pro-Biden super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, depicting the incumbent as a stooge for Beijing. “Everyone knew they lied about the virus—China,” a narrator declares, against the backdrop of a fluttering Chinese flag. “President Trump gave China his trust.” On &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/coronavirus-turns-china-2020-election-issue-trump-biden-clash-n1186611"&gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;, the Biden adviser Antony Blinken &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/politics/trump-china-virus.html"&gt;told reporters&lt;/a&gt; that “the president praised China and President Xi more than 15 times.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/trump-is-the-chinese-governments-most-useful-idiot/608638/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Adam Serwer: Trump is inciting a coronavirus culture war to save himself&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden camp’s logic is easy to understand. Trump has made China the primary scapegoat for his failures. His supporters are &lt;a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/04/17/america_first_action_pac_launches_beijing_biden_ads_stop_china_stop_joe_biden.html"&gt;running ads&lt;/a&gt; under the hashtag #BeijingBiden. So Biden and his strategists are meeting fire with fire. They’re answering the charge that the former vice president is soft on China by saying that Trump is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This form of ideological jujitsu comes naturally to Democrats of Biden’s generation, who in the 1990s tried to turn the tables on Republicans who had been painting them as antibusiness, anti-military, and pro-criminal during the Nixon and Reagan eras. In 1992, Bill Clinton ran for president &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/23/us/1992-campaign-assessment-clinton-s-retreat-change-tax-cut-for-middle-class-could.html"&gt;promising&lt;/a&gt; to cut taxes. In 2000, Al Gore &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/future/agenda/"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; to spend more on the military than George W. Bush. And in 1994, after successfully shepherding Clinton’s crime bill through the Senate, Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/09/joe-biden-crime-bill-and-americans-short-memory/597547/?utm_source=feed"&gt;crowed&lt;/a&gt;, “The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is now for 60 new death penalties … The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 125,000 new state prison cells … I’d like to see the conservative wing of the Democratic Party.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, beating the GOP at its own game was at times politically shrewd. Clinton’s ghoulish enthusiasm for the death penalty—which in 1992 led him to leave the campaign trail to oversee the execution of the mentally disabled murderer Ricky Ray Rector—probably helped inoculate him from the soft-on-crime attacks that had helped sink Michael Dukakis in 1988. Still, Biden’s decision to try to out-hawk Trump on China has three major problems. First, it promotes bad foreign policy. Second, it could stoke anti-Chinese racism. Third, it doesn’t even make long-term sense politically. Republicans, who promoted economic integration with China in the past, are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/politics/trump-china-virus.html"&gt;now committing themselves&lt;/a&gt; to a cold war with China. If Democrats think that’s a political environment in which they’ll thrive, they’re making a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the policy. The implication of Biden’s new ad is that China didn’t give Trump timely information about the COVID-19 outbreak, because Trump wasn’t tough enough on China’s leaders. The &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/coronavirus-trump-china-biden-ad_n_5e9b2159c5b63639081f5d15"&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt; mocks Trump’s praise for Xi Jinping and is filled with supposedly damning images of Trump and Xi together. By contrast, it shows Biden vowing, “I would be on the phone with China making it clear: We are going to need to be in your country. You have to be open. You have to be clear. We have to know what’s going on.” In other words, Biden would boss the Chinese around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/chinas-covid-19-conspiracy-theories/609772/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Renée DiResta: For China, the ‘USA virus’ is a geopolitical ploy&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a jingoistic fantasy. China is a rival superpower run by an authoritarian and fiercely nationalistic regime. Biden can’t force it to comply. When Beijing has given the United States valuable information about virus outbreaks in the past, it’s because American presidents spent time and money building &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/breaking-china-exactly-wrong-answer/608911/?utm_source=feed"&gt;joint U.S.-Chinese initiatives&lt;/a&gt; and took pains to make China’s leaders feel like equals. In 2009, Biden’s then-boss, Barack Obama, stood on a stage with the Chinese leader Hu Jintao in Beijing—in the kind of scene Biden mocks in his ad—and &lt;a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/joint-press-statement-president-obama-and-president-hu-china"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the two governments should “build upon our mutual interests and engage on the basis of equality and mutual respect.” The two leaders &lt;a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/realitycheck/the-press-office/us-china-joint-statement"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that they would “deepen cooperation on global public health issues, including Influenza A (H1N1) prevention, surveillance, reporting and control.” As the Rand Corporation’s Jennifer Huang Bouey has &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/testimonies/CT523.html"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, this cooperation hastened the development of an H1N1 vaccine. In suggesting that Biden could bludgeon China into submission—in a phone call, no less—the Biden campaign is peddling a lie about how public-health cooperation with China actually works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second problem with Biden’s attempt at ideological jujitsu is that, as with the crime bill, vulnerable people may get hurt. Democratic presidential candidates have bashed China before. But this isn’t an ordinary moment. The coronavirus—and Trump’s racist rhetoric about it—have sparked a horrifying &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/chinese-coronavirus-racist-attacks.html"&gt;rise in attacks&lt;/a&gt; on Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans. To his credit, Biden has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1223727977361338370?s=20"&gt;condemned&lt;/a&gt; Trump’s “xenophobia and fear-mongering.” Without meaning to, however, his new ads may exacerbate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/04/chinese-americans-pandemic-flashback/609400/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Chinese Americans have seen this before&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A presidential candidate can, of course, attack the Chinese government without attacking Chinese Americans. But doing so requires some rhetorical finesse—something the Biden ad lacks. The ad doesn’t say that Trump “rolled over” for “Xi Jinping” or the “Chinese government” or even “China.” It says he rolled over for “the Chinese.” As a result, Kaiser Kuo, editor at large of the website SupChina, told me, the ad may contribute to a political “race to the bottom,” in which “Asian Americans will suffer even more terribly from racism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were the Biden camp’s anti-China ads a surefire winner with voters, Machiavellians might justify them as a necessary evil. But for Democrats, posturing as more anti-China than the GOP is a poor long-term bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Republicans—such as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/politics/trump-china-virus.html"&gt;Trump, Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio, and Josh Hawley&lt;/a&gt;—stoking antagonism toward China makes ideological sense. The GOP is the party of military spending, national sovereignty, and white anxiety. For decades, Republicans have been looking for a new Ronald Reagan to lead them to victory over a new evil empire. They’ve tried Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. But China is the most credible candidate yet: a nonwhite, non-Christian, nominally Communist power that really can challenge America’s dominance in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/china-trolling-world-and-avoiding-blame/608332/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Shadi Hamid: China is avoiding blame by trolling the world&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats are by nature the party that advocates spending on health care and education rather than on military confrontation. Democrats are the people who now say, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/02/poll-us-voters-really-do-care-about-climate-change/606907/?utm_source=feed"&gt;in some polls&lt;/a&gt;, that climate change is their second-highest priority. You can’t view the climate threat as existential and simultaneously embrace a cold war that keeps the world’s two largest emitters of carbon dioxide from cooperating. Hawks won’t find the Democrats’ anti-China posturing credible. Even if a few Never Trumpers abandon the GOP in 2020, they’ll eventually come home to Cotton’s or Rubio’s or Nikki Haley’s more respectable militarism. And in trying to out-jingo the GOP, Democrats will alienate their Millennial activist base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2005, after two decades of Democrats like Biden and Clinton seeking to beat the GOP at its own game, the historian Rick Perlstein wrote a short book entitled &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stock-Ticker-Superjumbo-Democrats-Political/dp/0976147505"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stock Ticker and the Superjumbo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Perlstein argued that for a political party, as for a corporation (“Superjumbo” is a reference to Boeing’s competition with Airbus), short-term gyrations in response to the vagaries of the market (the “stock ticker”) can have devastating long-term effects if they undermine its core identity. Clinton—who passed free-trade deals, deregulated the financial markets, cut welfare benefits, signed legislation against gay marriage, and helped fill America’s jails—won two presidential elections. But toward the end of his tenure, Democrats &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/02/clinton-and-the-democrats/302112/?utm_source=feed"&gt;controlled fewer Senate seats and fewer state legislatures than they had in 50 years, and fewer governorships than they had in 30 years&lt;/a&gt;. Clinton had won; the Democratic Party had lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By attacking Trump for being insufficiently nationalist rather than being insufficiently internationalist, Biden is hastening a geopolitical confrontation that threatens progressive goals. And he’s sowing doubts about what the Democratic Party actually believes. He’s choosing short-term advantage over long-term principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what supporters of Bernie Sanders were worried about, and Biden is proving them right.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Peter Beinart</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/peter-beinart/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/AP_893645479401/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Lintao Zhang / AP</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Utter Futility of Biden’s China Rhetoric</title><published>2020-04-20T13:40:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T14:51:15-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The Democratic candidate tries to out-hawk Trump, but trying to beat Republicans at their own game is pointless—even dangerous.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/futility-bidens-china-hawkery/610285/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610048</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;According to the entry rules of &lt;em&gt;Double Shot at Love&lt;/em&gt;’s upcoming season, if a contestant lights himself on fire and dies, it’s his own fault—sorry!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double Shot &lt;/em&gt;was once an unsavory MTV dating show starring the twin sisters Rikki and Vikki (Season One) and then &lt;em&gt;Jersey Shore’&lt;/em&gt;s Vinny Gaudagnino and Pauly D (Season Two). The drama of the show was fueled by 20 contestants competing for the attention of one or the other of the two stars—sometimes swapping! Also alcohol. This spring, contestants in the unofficial third season will try to win the hearts of a pair of sisters named Bambi and Evani, who, as it happens, are simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The sisters and their suitors are all characters in The Sims 4, the latest iteration of the iconic life-simulation game. Their dating show exists only in the Sims universe. You can only “watch” it by turning on push notifications for a &lt;a href="https://everfallsims.tumblr.com/"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; run by the show’s creator. It’s not exactly reality television, but it should feature some of the same chaos and kissing and fighting that make that sort of thing worth watching. It might also be the only new dating show you can watch this summer, given that &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/reality-tv-coronavirus-cable-tlc-bravo-hgtv-1203550807/"&gt;most major reality shows&lt;/a&gt; have already &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/reality-tv-filming-coronavirus-what-shows-are-coming-back-2020-4"&gt;suspended production&lt;/a&gt; because of the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shae, the Simmer who invented the virtual version of &lt;em&gt;Double Shot&lt;/em&gt;, is a 30-year-old teacher from Arkansas. (She asked that I use only her first name out of concern for her privacy.) After Shae created Bambi and Evani, other Sims users sent her contestants to try out for the show. Shae has 30 virtual men to choose from so far, and she plans to whittle the list down to 12 or 16—more would probably crash the game, even with the modification she downloaded to get out of The Sims’s limit of eight virtual people per house. Entries are open until the end of the month, and Shae will post her first episode in the first week of May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As she prepares to host &lt;em&gt;Double Shot&lt;/em&gt;, Shae is also finishing up a Sims game of &lt;em&gt;The Bachelor&lt;/em&gt; in which one contestant really did light herself on fire and die. “I expect some things like that to happen” in the new show, she told me. “With so many Sims in one house there will probably be quite a few fights. Lots of crying. Sims cry a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A game with the possibility of accidental death is more absurd, for sure, than your average dating show on ordinary television, but that absurdity is welcome. In a world without happy hour with friends, or a night at the club, or 90 minutes of prime-time screaming and kissing, passing the time requires some creativity. Shae’s project is one of many strategies people are trying out to re-create the things they miss most about their regular lives. It’s also a sign of how weird internet culture is flourishing as normalcy dissolves. Everything is weird now. When there’s nothing else to do, why not spend the summer watching animations court each other?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the real world is bananas, you &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-01-28/the-sims-still-holds-adult-appeal-youtube-will-wright/10736904"&gt;escape into a fantasy&lt;/a&gt;. People have been using The Sims to do exactly that for two decades. The game gives players the open-ended task of maintaining a career and creating a family and watching their characters carry on with their lives, responding to basic human feelings like hunger and loneliness and saving up for their dream houses. Sims can die—the current version of the game is the first to include ghosts—but the point of the game is to enjoy a life in which you control every input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As of this January, 20 million people were &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/30/the-sims-4-has-reached-20-million-players/"&gt;playing&lt;/a&gt; The Sims 4, which came out six years ago. Patreon hosts a robust economy of custom content that can be added to the game, and the Sims community on Tumblr has long been one of the site’s largest and wildest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Tumblr, the premier home of alt-twee internet culture, is the best place to be during a pandemic. The people there already live in an imaginary world, but right now they’re pulling out all the stops. Tumblr’s data team has reported huge spikes of interest in &lt;a href="https://plotindevelopment.tumblr.com/"&gt;mermaids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tumblr.com/search/piratecore"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tumblr.com/search/cottagecore"&gt;cottages&lt;/a&gt; in the woods. &lt;a href="https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/oceancore"&gt;“Oceancore,”&lt;/a&gt; a tag for people who wish to live by the sea like the heroine of a 19th-century novel, had a 1,000 percent jump in likes during the last week of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Sims content on Tumblr more than doubled from mid-February to mid-March, largely due to a series of new creative prompts and challenges. The &lt;a href="https://sydney-simsyt.tumblr.com/post/613610959780610048"&gt;Quarantine Challenge,&lt;/a&gt; for example, requires participants to set up a new Sims game and play with only one Sim, who must wash their hands and work from home and find pen pals to sustain their social life. They are not allowed to leave the house, but they have to learn three skills. They may &lt;a href="https://w-sims.tumblr.com/post/613670732434653184/stayhome"&gt;videochat&lt;/a&gt; with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because The Sims is literally a game does not mean it is a joke. Each of the sisters in Shae’s version of &lt;em&gt;Double Shot&lt;/em&gt; has a complicated backstory and carefully calibrated personality. Bambi is 24 years old and a musician who “flirts like hell” and “doesn’t let anyone tell her what to do.” Evani is 26 years old and a journalist who loves facts and the truth and playing hard to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Anyone who wants to submit a Sim to compete for one of their hearts has to send Shae a file of their character, which she can then put into her game and manipulate as she sees fit. Once the virtual men are in the game, they’ll react to whatever she throws at them based on their preset skills and character traits. The Sims will participate in challenges and group dates, just like in other reality-TV shows, and they’ll be eliminated week by week. (Time passes roughly normally in the game, although it speeds up if everyone is sleeping.) The romance should develop organically between the preset characters, and so should the infighting. “I want to bring some Sims into the game that will clash and bash heads, because that causes drama and drama is fun to watch in reality TV,” Shae told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Shae will make “episodes” by observing what happens in the game and then writing it up with her own commentary. She’ll also use a game modification that lets a user pose their Sims and take a still picture. Then she’ll edit them in Photoshop to suit her aesthetic and post the results to Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I mentioned to everybody beforehand, any posed shots will just be an amplification of what happened in the house,” she said. “I’m not posting any Sims that are hugging and kissing if they’re not actually doing it in-game.” (On that note, her blog also warns that the show will include “adult content.” As in: “There will be some language, there will be some drinking, there might be some sexy times.”) Much like a typical reality show, this one will have a producer curating the shots and steering the action—nothing is entirely real, but nor is it entirely fake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bambi and Evani have an impressively diverse roster of matches to choose from so far, including &lt;a href="https://everfallsims.tumblr.com/post/614574777937641472/shleepysims-miles-rossi-for-everfallsims-s"&gt;a cop named Miles&lt;/a&gt; who is a self-described great cook and “sympathy puker”; a &lt;a href="https://yun-sims.tumblr.com/post/614665729734819840/lincoln-drew-for-everfallsims-double-shot-at"&gt;marketing manager named Lincoln&lt;/a&gt; who loves eggs Benedict and freckles; and a &lt;a href="https://everfallsims.tumblr.com/post/614573362167021568"&gt;single father named Cameron&lt;/a&gt; whose character description says he “had a scholarship to play e-sports at &lt;a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Foxbury_Institute"&gt;Foxbury Institute&lt;/a&gt; [an in-game Sims university], but gave it all up to become a chef.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Erin Guest, a 41-year-old from Melbourne, Australia, entered &lt;a href="https://everfallsims.tumblr.com/post/614763369775382528/renlishsims-an-entrant-to"&gt;an art-gallery curator&lt;/a&gt; named George. Lexi Stine, a 22-year-old from Pennsylvania, hoped to give her contestant an edge by suggesting that he might have already seen Bambi from afar at a musical performance. “I think my Sim”—&lt;a href="https://everfallsims.tumblr.com/post/614435793022435328/valocity-its-3am-and-i-made-a-sim-for"&gt;a music producer named Zander&lt;/a&gt;—“has a really good chance, since he thinks it’s ‘destiny’ for him to be with her,” she told me. Janel Johnson, a 24-year-old from Maryland, made &lt;a href="https://everfallsims.tumblr.com/post/614865378417442816/missmoodring-morgan-hudgens-for-everfallsimss"&gt;a barista named Morgan&lt;/a&gt; to enter into the game. She’s trying not to get her hopes up about Morgan’s chances so she doesn’t feel too disappointed if he gets kicked off. “In the end all I want is for the bachelorettes to find a happy ending,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It’s all very romantic, of course. People have been created out of thin air to fall in love with each other for no reason, except entertaining those of us who can’t really go around kissing strangers at the moment. “I’ve always been a big romantic,” Shae said. “I love reading romance novels. I love romance movies.” She’s been playing The Sims since it was first released 20 years ago. “Doing a love challenge like this brings something new to the game that I didn’t know I could do before,” she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Though The Sims is a game designed to be played in solitude, having a showrunner like Shae makes it into a shared project for too-solitary times. Strangers on the internet are trusting that she’ll use their characters to come up with something enjoyable to watch, and they’ll stick around to talk about it as it unfurls. They’re invested in how it turns out not just because they are competitive, but because, in a moment of near-total romantic standstill in the real world, the kind of voyeurism promised by dating shows becomes even more compelling. Nobody is going on dates or indulging in reckless behavior right now—not even the people who normally get paid to do so on national television. In a twist, The Sims is now a way to playact not just an alternate life, but any life at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kaitlyn Tiffany</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/kaitlyn-tiffany/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/tumblr_fd91243b6130ec8daf28994bc6b50a3c_57d9a5d2_1280/lead_960.png"><media:credit>everfallsims / Tumblr</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The World Where &lt;em&gt;The Bachelor &lt;/em&gt;Will Never Stop Airing</title><published>2020-04-19T07:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-19T11:02:15-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Reality TV won’t be filming for the foreseeable future—except in The Sims.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/sims-bachelor-dating-show-simulation-game/610048/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610207</id><content type="html">&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;S&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;pring break typically&lt;/span&gt; marks the start of tourist season in Marfa, Texas, when the streets fill with families from Dallas and handsome Los Angeles couples. College kids host late-night parties in Airbnbs. Influencers pose in front of crumbling adobe ruins. And every few weeks, we get a celebrity sighting: Guy Fieri riding a bike down the potholed streets, or Matthew McConaughey hunkering down to complete his book of poetry. A few years ago, a friendly street cat brushed up against Heidi Klum’s ankles at dinner, and a few days later, it was on her private plane, heading to its new home in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until a month ago, complaining about the tourists was a low-stakes bonding activity around town. We grumbled about how they stood in the middle of the road taking pictures and how they wore bathrobes in public, as if they saw the whole town as an all-inclusive resort. (Maybe that cat really wasn’t a stray after all.) Even the tourists resented the tourists. “I was here during spring break two years ago and it was kind of disgusting,” a visitor from Los Angeles told me last year. “I just didn’t want there to be too many people like &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; here,” his friend added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the streets are empty, as they are everywhere. But when the tourists disappeared, so did most of the service-industry jobs, which has been financially disastrous for some locals. Still, not everyone is unhappy with the situation: “I was out in town yesterday and noticed how quiet and calm it was, and couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief to feel that old feeling of what Marfa used to feel like before all the tourists and craziness of random people walking around,” PJ Serrano posted on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Our pandemic summer&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I moved to Marfa eight years ago. In the finicky taxonomy of tourist towns, that makes me a transplant—not a native or a local, but not a visitor either. I did what I could to immerse myself in the community, joining the volunteer fire department, delivering lunches for Meals on Wheels. Still, I’m aware that my roots here are shallow. I may live here, but I’m not &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; here. That tension was mostly tolerable until the coronavirus—and the fear of the coronavirus—amplified these fraught insider-outsider dynamics. Now I sit in my house and wonder: What does it mean to belong somewhere? And how much pressure can you put on a community before it starts to fracture?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;S&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;mall towns are&lt;/span&gt; hotbeds for gossip. Now that we can’t gather at the bars, we exchange what snippets we can at the post office, on Facebook, and on socially distant walks by the railroad tracks. Our friends who work in the grocery stores are the best sources. They know who bought 18 rolls of toilet paper. They keep tabs on the unfamiliar faces that are still showing up. “There are definitely people hiding out here,” a cashier told me last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Marfa, as elsewhere, the crisis has inspired &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/marfa-steps-up-service-worker-relief-fund?fbclid=IwAR05KHL0KeJobdR52SgglkYtoerblkYLvKFnlAqKJqHLw23gxx1RrfB-ogI"&gt;grassroots mutual aid&lt;/a&gt;, but also a creeping mistrust. The other day, from across the fence, my neighbor told me that he was busy filling shotgun shells with salt—he doesn’t want to maim anyone, but he figures he might need them to intimidate. Last week, the county sheriff announced on Facebook that three people would be flying into our tiny municipal airport from New Jersey on a private plane. The post didn’t make this clear, but one was a full-time resident who’s lived here for decades; the other passengers were long-standing second-home owners. The group had been trying to get to Marfa from New York City for more than a week, but no cars were available to rent, and all the commercial flights had been canceled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information was not received well among Marfa’s permanent residents: “This could wipe out the entire population of Marfa.” “Why were they in NJ if they are ‘from Marfa’?” “How long have they been in NJ?” The original post listed the three people’s home addresses. One commenter threatened to keep watch with a shotgun to make sure they stayed inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a city-council meeting, the mayor suggested putting limits on what nonlocals could buy to prevent resources from dwindling. But how can we define who counts as local, a council member asked? “You know,&lt;em&gt; local&lt;/em&gt;,” someone else said. “It’s a small enough town. I think we all know.” I felt a twinge of unease; my driver’s license may identify me as a resident, but did that really count?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resolution didn’t pass, but it pointed to the darkening mood around town. When a case of COVID-19 was confirmed across the border, in Ojinaga, Mexico, some people began to argue that the border should be shut down completely. A local property owner posted an advertisement for his rentals, encouraging people to “escape to Marfa during COVID-19”; in response, the city council banned rentals—short- or long-term—to nonresidents. The stores were for the most part fully stocked, and there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the entire Big Bend region, but the feeling of imminent scarcity persisted. Never mind the local developer whose construction crews were still working in close proximity to one another, or the pointed lack of social distancing at the hardware store, or the governor’s slowness in issuing a stay-at-home order—the threat came from outside, and you could spot it by its out-of-state license plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-unique-threat-south-young-people/609241/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The coronavirus’s unique threat to the South&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic brought these bad vibes to the surface, but their roots predate the current crisis. Highly touristed rural areas are often treated as not quite real by the vacationers and second-home owners who flock to them, as Anne Helen Petersen &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/coronavirus-covid-cities-second-homes-rural-small-towns"&gt;wrote for &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/coronavirus-covid-cities-second-homes-rural-small-towns"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Marfa is described by visitors as an escape, an oasis, a retreat. Seen through a vacationer’s eyes, it’s a place without politics and problems—it’s also a place without ventilators. There’s no hospital in the entire county, which is larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined. You wouldn’t know it from the travel-magazine write-ups, but Marfa’s population is older, poorer, and in worse health than most Americans; it’s also a majority-Latino community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, when I moved here, Marfa had one coffee shop, one liquor store, one gym, and two bars. Although income inequality was a persistent issue, we at least had a shared context. In the past several years, though, galloping gentrification has spawned a parallel set of businesses catering to tourists and transplants: first a fancy coffee shop, then a fancy gym, a wine bar, another fancy coffee shop. Slowly, these businesses have begun to crowd out those catering to locals. Marfa has transformed into a town where you can purchase a $15 cocktail but not spark plugs. The second-home and short-term-rental market drove real-estate prices up so high that it is practically impossible to buy a Marfa house if you make Marfa wages. These are the preexisting conditions, as it were, that underlie the current atmosphere of fear and anxiety. Maybe it doesn’t feel as though we’re all in this together because it hasn’t felt like that for a while. Waiting out the pandemic 2,000 miles from where I was born, I feel a heightened awareness of the overlapping, contradictory roles I play in my adopted community: gentrifier, taxpayer, transplant, neighbor, friend, stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, I spoke with a woman who lives full-time on Block Island, a popular vacation spot off the coast of Rhode Island. When the second-home owners started flocking in, things got tense on the island, she said—someone threatened to blow up a transformer to keep nonlocals away. She knew things were &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;bad when her friends stopped waving to passing cars, a tried-and-true small-town tradition. Her story gave me some hope; in Marfa, at least, we’re still waving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I don’t spend time on Facebook, things feel less dire. Like everyone else, my pandemic fantasies are mundane. I think about July, when everyone’s peach trees will explode with fruit all at once, and I think about the box filled with surplus fruit in city hall. In my daydream Marfa, there are some tourists, but not too many, and when I go to pay my utility bill in person, I fill up my bag with peaches and leave some zucchini behind. The room is full of people, some who’ve lived here a year, some who’ve lived here their whole life. We smile at one another. We’ve been through something—if not &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;, then at least in proximity to one another. That’s not enough, perhaps, but it’s not nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Monroe</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/rachel-monroe/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/GettyImages_693475263/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Epics / Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Who Has the Right to Shelter in a Small Town?</title><published>2020-04-19T06:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T15:44:19-04:00</updated><summary type="html">People are fleeing big cities for rural areas in an attempt to outrun COVID-19.

	&lt;h4 dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Our Pandemic Summer&lt;/a&gt;, by Ed Yong&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In March, Ed Yong &lt;a href="#edyong"&gt;asked how the pandemic would end&lt;/a&gt;—this month, he’s asking how it will continue through the strange summer that awaits us. Scientists will spend the months ahead processing new insights about the path the virus took through the country and making careful decisions about how to keep it from exploding again. The most crucial thing they need to understand is what proportion of the U.S. population has actually been infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If it turns out that, say, 20 percent of the U.S. has been infected, that would mean the coronavirus is more transmissible but less deadly than scientists think. It would also mean that a reasonable proportion of the country has some immunity. If that proportion could be slowly and safely raised to the level necessary for herd immunity—60 to 80 percent, depending on the virus’s transmissibility—the U.S. might not need to wait for a vaccine. However, if just 1 to 5 percent of the population has been infected—the range that many researchers think is likelier—that would mean “this is a truly devastating virus, and we have built up no real population immunity,” said Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and immunologist at Harvard. “Then we’re in dire straits in terms of how to move forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="2" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/how-coronavirus-will-change-young-peoples-lives/609862/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Generation C Has Nowhere to Turn&lt;/a&gt;, by Amanda Mull&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For today’s children and young adults, the future has never looked bleaker. Long-coveted internships have been canceled, job opportunities have dried up, and social development happens through a computer screen. Most young people in America are less likely than their parents to have the savings and security they need to stay afloat during the pandemic and its aftershocks, and, as a result, they’re more likely to see their lives and careers derailed. Amanda Mull paints an ominous portrait of what the future could look like for people now in their late teens and 20s, whom she dubs Generation C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These economic conditions are dangerous for nearly all Americans, but older people are more likely to have stable professional lives and finances to help cushion the blow. People just starting out now, and those who will begin their adult lives in the years following the pandemic, will be asked to walk a financial tightrope with no practice and, for most, no safety net. Fewer of them will be able to turn to their parents or other family members for significant help: Even in the relative boom times of the past few years, 40 percent of Americans didn’t have the cash on hand to weather a $400 emergency expense. With the financial losses and medical debt millions of American families will accrue over the course of the pandemic, even that modest flexibility will likely be lost for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="3" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/save-hydroxychloroquine-people-like-me/609865/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Some Patients Really Need the Drug that Trump Keeps Pushing&lt;/a&gt;, by Maya L. Harris &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Donald Trump has repeatedly endorsed hydroxychloroquine, an immunosuppressive drug, to treat COVID-19 (&lt;a href="#hydroxychloroquine"&gt;more on what we know about hydroxychloroquine below&lt;/a&gt;). That’s frightening to those who rely on the drug to treat lupus and other chronic conditions. The government is stockpiling 29 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, but the people who need it to survive are facing shortages—and there’s still no evidence that the compound is helpful in a significant portion of COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent my career as a civil-rights advocate, I’m acutely aware that the people most affected by the hydroxychloroquine drug shortages live in communities or belong to demographic groups that are among the most vulnerable, even in the absence of a pandemic. Black Americans suffer higher rates of not only lupus but a host of other chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension, making them more susceptible to the coronavirus. This is compounded by structural inequalities that have denied too many black people access to adequate health insurance, employment, housing, and transportation—all keys to high-quality health care in this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="4" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/04/two-pandemics-us-coronavirus-inequality/609622/?utm_source=feed"&gt;The Pandemic Will Cleave America in Two&lt;/a&gt;, by Joe Pinsker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Most Americans will experience the full course of the pandemic in one of two ways: as a disruptive and frightening moment in their life, or as a scarring event with lasting and life-altering effects. Staying healthy is to some degree a matter of luck, but existing inequalities have left some communities and households more vulnerable than others to infection, job loss, and upheaval. Those same communities are also less equipped to climb out of turmoil when the pandemic ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One medical professor’s grim prediction, made when I spoke with him in mid-March, is already coming true. According to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/01/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-cases-map.html"&gt;recent data from health officials in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, several neighborhoods with the lowest median household incomes were among those with the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. This is terrible for the residents of those neighborhoods, but it may also be bad for everyone: &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5051437/pdf/bmjopen-2016-011699.pdf"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; in Delhi, India, found that outbreaks of influenza in the poorest parts of the city propelled the spread of the disease more widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Moreover, the long-standing, intractable problems in many lower-income areas, whether urban or rural, won’t be put on hold during a pandemic. “A lot of communities are already dealing with things like being over-policed, police violence, excess pollution exposure, and unemployment,” Hedwig Lee, the sociologist, said. “There are other [things] that have been impacting communities in a large-scale, wholesale way—some currently and some for many generations—and that makes this even scarier in terms of what it will look like once we get through this storm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="5" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/why-were-running-out-of-masks-in-the-coronavirus-crisis/609757/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Why We’re Running Out of Masks&lt;/a&gt;, by Olga Khazan &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Doctors in the world’s wealthiest country are now reusing cheap face masks for days on end while their neighbors construct their own from scraps and strings. Many Americans see the dwindling mask supply as a shortcoming of the Strategic National Stockpile, a secretive network of disaster-prep warehouses around the country run by the federal government. But former directors of the program say that the stockpile was never intended to supply the entire nation during a pandemic; they describe it as “a stopgap, not a safety net.” Due in part to congressional funding objectives and to the myriad potential disasters that strategists prepare for simultaneously, masks weren’t a priority for the officials who oversee the stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With the remaining money, the officials in charge of the stockpile had to decide whether they wanted to plan for a hurricane, flood, tornado, pandemic, or terrorist threat. All of those disasters require the stockpile to be stocked with different stuff. “It isn’t like comparing apples and oranges,” says Tara O’Toole, a former homeland-security official who chaired an advisory &lt;a href="https://www8.nationalacademies.org/pa/projectview.aspx?key=51041"&gt;committee&lt;/a&gt; on the stockpile and who is now executive vice president at In-Q-Tel. “It’s like comparing apples and Volkswagens and bird food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After 9/11, the people in charge of the stockpile were concerned about bioterrorism—threats like anthrax—and sudden, mass-casualty events like, say, a bombing at the Super Bowl. This made some sense, but in the process officials took their foot off the pandemic-preparedness gas pedal. The response to the 2009 swine-flu pandemic was seen as a success, and the stockpile-minders moved on to the next item on their disaster checklist. “I think as human beings, we sometimes, not that we get complacent, but it’s like, &lt;em&gt;Oh, we’ve got this&lt;/em&gt;. And we did. We had it,” says Deborah Levy, who oversaw the stockpile as acting division director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2013 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="6" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/04/navigating-joint-custody-under-coronavirus-quarantine/609676/?utm_source=feed"&gt;How Are Parents Supposed to Deal With Joint Custody Right Now?&lt;/a&gt;, by Deborah Copaken&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Some lifestyles and living arrangements are proving harder to maintain in quarantine than others—and joint-custody arrangements can be downright impossible. As deaths in New York mounted, Deborah Copaken and her ex-husband suddenly had to decide whether shuttling their son back and forth across the city was safe. Experts assured her that co-parents were unlikely to face legal consequences for choosing to keep a child in one place for the duration of stay-at-home orders, but the decisions have already proved harmful to many peaceful parenting partnerships, including Copaken’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The hostile texts continued for more than a week, during which my ex would ask when and how I would be sending our son to him for his custodial weekend, and I would say, “I’m not doing that, sorry,” while offering him all the makeup days he wanted on the other side and suggestions for outside activities they could share together, as well as compassion over the heartbreak of being separated from his son. He said he’d rent a car to pick up our kid. I explained that he would come into contact with multiple people at the car-rental office, after which our child would be spending time in my ex’s large apartment building, sharing a small elevator with its elderly residents. “We have to do what’s best for our son and the greater good right now. Not what’s best for you,” I texted imperiously.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Scientists homing in on potential therapies for COVID-19 are focused on the virus’s 29 proteins. Proteins are the mechanisms of action in all cells—in viral cells, they’re the warriors that take over a healthy human body. Proteins in the coronavirus form spikes that latch on to a common receptor in the body, force human cells to replicate viral RNA, and more. Researchers are currently working on drugs to interfere with those processes, but it’s a tricky problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea is to stop these virus-ordered functions without interfering with a cell’s normal functions. Here, the best analogy for a potential SARS-CoV-2 drug may not be an antibiotic, which kills foreign bacterial cells rather indiscriminately. “I think it’s much more like a cancer therapy,” &lt;a href="http://cancer.ucsf.edu/people/profiles/shokat_kevan.3666"&gt;Kevan Shokat&lt;/a&gt;, a pharmacologist at UC San Francisco, told me. In other words, it may be about selectively killing the human cells that have gone haywire. This opens up the possibility of many more drug targets in the host, but it also adds a challenge: It is much easier for a drug to distinguish between human and bacteria than between human and virus-hijacked human.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novel “test and trace” systems are emerging in countries such as China and South Korea, where social-distancing measures ,are beginning to ease up. Using information from sources as varied as  cellphone GPS and credit-card purchases, these systems can track citizens’ movements and interactions, identifying and alerting those who have recently come into contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Such systems—some of which even publicly broadcast the information of infected individuals—run headfirst into issues of privacy, government surveillance, and complicated stigmas surrounding health. But they could be the best way to preserve other democratic values in the face of widespread illness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has already required Americans to embrace extreme behavior in the name of saving lives. Tens of millions of Americans are living under house arrest. Many chief executives and entrepreneurs have said they agree with a government mandate to shut down their businesses. In these strange times, common rights that once seemed nonnegotiable have been suddenly renegotiated. Compared with our life just six weeks ago, smartphone tracing might seem like a violation of our dignity and privacy—and compared with our life six years from now, I hope it will be. But compared with our present nightmare, strategically sacrificing our privacy might be the best way to protect other freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-March, a controversial French doctor’s claim that the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could treat COVID-19 made its way to Donald Trump via the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz. Since then, the president has spoken of the drug as a miracle cure, even going so far as to issue an emergency authorization of its use to treat COVID-19 in American hospitals. James Hamblin, an &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; staff writer and a medical doctor, reviewed everything we know about hydroxychloroquine—which inhibits the immune system—and found that the evidence in its favor is sparse. Some COVID-19 patients could even get sicker if they were to take it. But Trump is pushing the drug anyway, arguing that even if it doesn’t work, it’s worth a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you have to lose? is a dark sentiment from a president managing a crisis that his administration failed to prepare for: It &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-are-sick-lost-february/608521/?utm_source=feed"&gt;failed to develop testing&lt;/a&gt;, failed to communicate, and failed to have enough face masks for doctors. There is, in fact, much to lose. Americans also need hydroxychloroquine to treat serious immune conditions and parasitic diseases. Since Trump began promoting the drug, people have been&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/business/doctors-buying-coronavirus-drugs.html?searchResultPosition=3"&gt; hoarding&lt;/a&gt; it, and it has been added to the growing list of &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/dsp_ActiveIngredientDetails.cfm?AI=Chloroquine%20Phosphate%20Tablets&amp;amp;st=c&amp;amp;tab=tabs-4"&gt;drug shortages&lt;/a&gt;. Two weeks ago, in an attempt to procure some, an Arizona couple &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/health/arizona-coronavirus-chloroquine-death/index.html"&gt;ingested chloroquine&lt;/a&gt;, which is meant to be used in fish tanks. The man died.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House, the CDC, the WHO, and world governments have been flashing infection charts for weeks. But these models aren’t meant to be crystal balls: They represent &lt;em&gt;possibilities&lt;/em&gt;, rather than predictions. When you see any projected death toll, pay careful attention to the parameters that come along with it. Is that number indicative of a worst-case scenario—if, say, American hospitals were to all close tomorrow? Or is it a goal we are to work toward, requiring careful action to be taken by all in order to make it a reality?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of a pandemic, we have the disadvantage of higher uncertainty, but the advantage of being early: The costs of our actions are lower because the disease is less widespread. As we prune the tree of the terrible, unthinkable branches, we are not just choosing a path; we are shaping the underlying parameters themselves, because the parameters themselves are not fixed. If our hospitals are not overrun, we will have fewer deaths and thus a lower fatality rate. That’s why we shouldn’t get bogged down in litigating a model’s numbers. Instead we should focus on the parameters we can change, and change them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="11" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians including the president continue to tout what our staff writer Derek Thompson calls the “gospel of growth”: “The notion that Americans cannot afford to save tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of lives, if it means sacrificing a quarter or two of gross domestic product.” Economists, however, are quick to point out that unchecked viral spread would create an economic catastrophe unto itself. The ideal solution would be a system that effectively freezes the economy in place until the pandemic is over, with objectives that include paying people to stop working, ensuring protections for companies, and focusing on the business of science—namely, testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a normal recession, you want to boost demand,” said the Northwestern economist Martin Eichenbaum. “But we don’t really want to boost demand in the very short run at all, right now. We don’t want United to be flying full planes. We don’t want restaurants serving food to dine-in customers. We want everybody to stay in and hold on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows that we should—as incomprehensible as this may sound—hope for a deep, short recession, caused by a cliff dive in many forms of economic activity. That would be a clear signal that people have gone home and that the face-to-face economy has been shut down to limit the spread of disease. “The question I would ask of our leaders is: What will you regret?” Eichenbaum said ... “It’s pretty obvious what the worst-case scenario is. You want to err on the side of saving lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="12" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 10 percent of COVID-19 deaths in the United States have occurred in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia—and many victims are young. Disparities in health-care access and policies, as well as high poverty levels, mean that 40-to-60-year-old Southerners are more likely than other similarly aged Americans to suffer from chronic conditions that make the coronavirus more dangerous. And those aren’t the only risk factors threatening younger populations in the South:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates have &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-inmates-insigh/spread-of-coronavirus-accelerates-in-us-jails-and-prisons-idUSKBN21F0TM"&gt;drawn attention&lt;/a&gt; to the extreme vulnerability of people in prison to the coronavirus—and the South incarcerates a larger proportion of its population &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population-in-u-s-adult-correctional-systems-by-correctional-status/?dataView=1&amp;amp;currentTimeframe=0&amp;amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Incarcerated%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D"&gt;than anywhere else&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/an-explosion-of-coronavirus-cases-cripples-a-federal-prison-in-louisiana/2020/03/29/75a465c0-71d5-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html"&gt;A federal prison in Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; has already seen a spike in COVID-19 cases this week. Also, a global fear in this pandemic is that it will sicken health professionals and doctors, and leave them unable to contend with waves of hospitalizations. Southern states have some of the lowest ratios of active physicians to patients &lt;a href="https://store.aamc.org/2019-state-physician-workforce-data-report.html"&gt;in the country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after the pandemic ends, measuring the total loss of life caused by the coronavirus will be a herculean task.The virus is likely to kill many people who will never be tested for COVID-19. For victims with comorbidities such as heart and respiratory conditions, determining one specific cause of death can be virtually impossible. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, the environmental scientist John Mutter, who studies how natural disasters impact human well-being, explains the difficult calculus of tallying deaths from a crisis that stretches into every part of society:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After Katrina, there was a lot of infant mortality. Poor women in Mississippi—who probably didn’t get very good health care anyway—when they were pregnant [during and after the storm] got no health care. So infant mortality rose for a while, and the reason was not [physically related to the hurricane itself]. It’s because people can’t get access to health care. It just goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here in New York, after Hurricane Sandy, one of the veterans’ hospitals had to close. People have done studies on the excess mortality associated with closing one hospital. It’s a cumulative thing. It wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t for Sandy. That’s the way to think about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="14" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-airborne-go-outside-masks/609235/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Everyone Thinks They’re Right About Masks&lt;/a&gt;, by Ed Yong&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying at home is the number-one recommendation to minimize the spread of COVID-19. If you must leave your home, health organizations such as the CDC recommend keeping at least a six-foot distance from other people. But some experts have suggested that coronavirus particles can travel farther than six feet and linger in the air for longer than previously thought. How the virus behaves in air is still a mystery—as is whether masks can protect people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could tie yourself in knots gaming out the various scenarios that might pose a risk outdoors, but the environmental engineer Linsey Marr recommends a simple technique. “When I go out now, I imagine that everyone is smoking, and I pick my path to get the least exposure to that smoke,” she told me. If that’s the case, I asked her, is it irrational to hold your breath when another person walks past you and you don’t have enough space to move away? “It’s not irrational; I do that myself,” she said. “I don’t know if it makes a difference, but in theory it could. It’s like when you walk through a cigarette plume.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="15" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/next-covid-19-testing-crisis/609193/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Private Labs Are Fueling a New Coronavirus Testing Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, by Alexis C. Madrigal and Robinson Meyer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private companies such as Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp are now leading the country in COVID-19 testing. Tests might be more widely available now, but that hasn’t been matched by increased processing speed. In California alone, more than 57,400 people are currently awaiting the release of their test results, primarily from Quest—and state testing numbers don’t reflect them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through BioReference and other commercial companies, as well as its own laboratories, New York now has almost 20 percent of all the completed tests in the United States. As a consequence, the number of confirmed cases has skyrocketed, but at least New York knows the severity of its outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If New York is on one end of the spectrum, California is on the other. What’s unclear is how common California’s and Quest’s situations are. No other state reports that it has such a huge backlog of tests stuck in private laboratories, but California’s reporting idiosyncrasy likely reflects reality better than other states’ reporting. For example, Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker tweeted yesterday that private-lab results in his state are taking “4-7 days and sometimes even up to 10 days.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jared Kushner’s “shadow task force” on the coronavirus has spent most of its time attempting to ramp up drive-through testing locations, but &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;’s Robinson Meyer revealed that a Kushner-associated project may have involved a major breach of ethics. Oscar Health, an insurance firm co-founded and funded by Kushner’s brother Joshua, posted source code on Github that indicates the company built a website to allow users to search for information about symptoms and nearby test sites. The site is suspiciously similar to one Trump claimed Google was building earlier in March; Oscar Health is not Google, but Google’s parent company is a major investor in Oscar. Even though the website was constructed for free and never went live, experts believe that Kushner’s use of Oscar as a government contractor could be in strict violation of federal regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not typical. It’s usually not allowed,” Jessica Tillipman, an assistant dean at the George Washington University School of Law and an expert on anti-corruption law, told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oscar’s relationship with the Trump administration could breach federal law in two ways, Tillipman and other experts told me. First, companies are generally not supposed to work for the federal government for free, though some exceptions can be made in a national emergency. “The concern, when you have some free services, is that it makes the government beholden to the company,” Tillipman said. More important, she said, any Kushner involvement may have violated the “impartiality rule,” which requires federal employees to refrain from making decisions when they even appear to involve a conflict of interest. The rule also prohibits federal employees from making a decision in which close relatives may have a financial stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="17" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many American hospitals still lack the ventilators, protective equipment, and personnel to provide adequate care to the number of sick patients they’re expecting in the coming days and weeks. In New York, the health-care workforce is so thin that medical students are graduating early and retirees are returning to emergency rooms. Meanwhile, hospitals are scrambling to institute guidelines on how to ration resources when there’s not enough of them to go around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In an attempt to lift some of the burden from individual providers, hospitals around the country are convening emergency meetings to develop guidelines for rationing, according to who is least likely to benefit from treatment. The goal is to make the guidelines objective, accurate, and easy to use, as well as to minimize the waste of resources. The instructions could be as strict as age limits for intensive care, or withholding care from people who have the lowest chance of survival, such as those suffering from heart failure or emphysema. On Thursday, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/25/coronavirus-patients-do-not-resucitate/"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reported that Northwestern University’s medical center, in Chicago, was considering putting every patient with COVID-19 on “do not resuscitate” (DNR) status. This would mean that if their heart stops, no “code blue” would be called; instead, a time of death would be noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="18" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In late March, doctors began to treat COVID-19 patients with infusions of blood plasma from survivors of the disease. The technique, known as convalescent-plasma therapy, has varying success—and requires a constant stream of willing, healthy donors. If the treatment proves to be effective, it could become an important weapon against the coronavirus as more and more people recover from weeks spent sick. But that would require quite a bit of scaling up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Michael J. Joyner, a doctor at the Mayo Clinic, likened this phase to the “craft brewing” of convalescent-plasma therapy. It’s available at only a few academic centers, and doctors are reliant on personal connections to recruit donors. Getting to the “national-brewery model,” he says, requires involving bigger players. The FDA could help identify donors, and a network of national blood banks could send COVID-19 plasma to hospitals in small cities and towns. Eventually, pharmaceutical companies might be interested in pooling and purifying plasma down to a concentrated dose of antibodies—at which point convalescent plasma truly would be a standardized product you pull off the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;All of this, of course, is contingent on plasma actually working against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Our contributing writer Deborah Copaken has a presumptive case of COVID-19. She sleeps in her own bedroom, isolated from the rest of her family—as do her three children and partner, all of whom are either sick or in quarantine because of travel abroad. “Part of me wants, as soon as we’re better, to grab my three kids and my partner and escape someplace remote,” she writes. “But where? COVID-19 is everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I spoke with my daughter yesterday morning from her Airbnb in D.C. She’s not sure where to go after her 14 days of quarantine are over. She’d planned on staying in her &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@sashakogan/rlly-out-here-lol-e6571abdd21"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in Cameroon for two years but was able to complete only six months before the emergency evacuation, and she’s not allowed to return. As a Peace Corps volunteer, she’s not eligible for unemployment. She is, at 23, broke, heartbroken, and homeless, which is another reason I’d better not die right now. My son is going stir-crazy all alone in his Airbnb. I haven’t been able to hug him since he got back from Greece. Should he come home on March 31 or pay for another week of the Airbnb, given our illnesses? How long will we remain sick? The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; says two weeks for a mild case, and three to six weeks for a more serious bout. But that’s just the accepted dogma right now. Tomorrow, those numbers could change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="20" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;American life will start to feel familiar again when we reach the point of “population-level immunity”: when some significant proportion of people, perhaps 70 percent, have resistance to the virus, gained via vaccination or recovery. Once we pass this threshold, restaurants will likely reopen before concert venues, and schools before sports stadiums. But it’s hard to guess how long all that will take. Broadly, there are four possible timelines, ranging from two months (unlikely) to 18 months (most likely).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Amid everything I’ve described so far—the crowd-free baseball games, the bars and restaurants with spaced-out seating, and so on—researchers around the world will have been scrambling to develop a vaccine. Spring 2021 is about the earliest anyone expects one to be available … Vaccines take so long to make because they are difficult to perfect. There are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/?utm_source=feed"&gt;a series of methodical trials&lt;/a&gt; done to make sure they don’t harm healthy people, to make sure they generate the desired antibodies, and to make sure those antibodies actually defend against the disease. These aren’t overcautious bureaucratic safeguards; if researchers are making something that’s going to be pumped into the arms of hundreds of millions, probably billions, of people, they want to make sure it’s just right.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Early reports that COVID-19 caused only mild symptoms in healthy young people left many Millenials and members of Gen Z worried less about their own health than about the risk the coronavirus posed to their grandparents. Kerry Kennedy Meltzer, a young internal-medicine resident in New York City, insists that those in their 20s and 30s are wrong to feel such a strong sense of personal safety. On one recent overnight shift, Meltzer writes, five out of six patients she saw with COVID-19 symptoms were close to her age or younger—and their cases weren’t all mild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Late in the night, another young patient came in with a high fever and no underlying health conditions. They’d had a dry cough for the past four days. They’d come to the hospital after finding they were unable to walk a few feet without getting severely short of breath. On their chest X-ray, I saw lungs that were almost completely whited out, indicating a significant amount of inflammation. It was clear how uncomfortable they were, and how desperately they were trying to catch their breath. They were in a different category from the previous patients I’d seen that night. They needed to be admitted. They needed testing. They needed close monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mere months ago, the United States ranked higher than every other industrialized nation in pandemic preparedness. Today, it’s on track to lose 2.2 million lives to COVID-19 by the fall, in part due to a White House that, our science reporter Ed Yong writes, is “a ghost town of scientific expertise.” Depending on how the next few months play out, America faces multiple possible futures—each bringing integral changes to public life and politics that will last far longer than the pandemic itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After the pandemic, people who recover from COVID-19 might be shunned and stigmatized, as were survivors of Ebola, SARS, and HIV. Health-care workers will take time to heal: One to two years after SARS hit Toronto, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17326946"&gt;people who dealt with the outbreak&lt;/a&gt; were still less productive and more likely to be experiencing burnout and post-traumatic stress. People who went through long bouts of quarantine will carry the scars of their experience. “My colleagues in Wuhan note that some people there now refuse to leave their homes and have developed agoraphobia,” says Steven Taylor of the University of British Columbia, who wrote &lt;em&gt;The Psychology of Pandemics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more and more people have fallen ill in the United States, experts’ fears that the coronavirus’s reach was enabled by asymptomatic carriers have been confirmed. “Every six days that the country did not test, every six days that it did not act, the number of infected Americans doubled,” our reporters write. Many of the COVID-19 cases appearing and worsening now are in people who moved around freely in February and early March, when the CDC’s reported numbers of confirmed cases were low and lagging. Now the country is stuck trying to stop a machine already in motion.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;American cities, blinded by the lack of testing data, did little as crucial days went by. On March 7, as the severity of the local outbreak was becoming known, huge events were allowed to go on. More than 30,000 people attended a Seattle Sounders game that night. No one wanted to say what has now become clear: February was our chance to get this right. We lost that entire month. And we now live in a new era of work stoppages, overwhelmed hospitals, dead elders, and a wrecked economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;You can find your state’s count of coronavirus tests, cases, and deaths—along with &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;’s assessment of how reliable those data are—in our &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-people-tested-sick-coronavirus-covid-each-state-america/608413/?utm_source=feed"&gt;interactive COVID-19 Tracking Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start="24" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Recommendations for extreme social distancing have intensified, but many Americans still struggle or outright refuse to abide by the new rules of everyday life. Trying to persuade someone to stay away from public life can be frustrating, scary, and tense—but according to family psychologists and public-health experts, it’s best done with kindness and understanding. Reminding people of the bigger picture, sharing stories of individual lives already affected by the coronavirus, and suggesting alternative activities are all useful tactics for conveying the urgency of social distancing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The coronavirus outbreak is a story often told numerically: confirmed cases, fatality rates, hospital-bed capacities, and so on. But most of the time, you’ll probably have better luck persuading someone if you leave out the statistics. “Trying to identify a human face of people who have experienced coronavirus” probably has a better chance of swaying a listener who hasn’t yet seen the catastrophic effects of the virus firsthand, said Rachael Piltch-Loeb, a fellow at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you still need help persuading a loved one to stay in place, one of our editors, Saahil Desai, wrote about his own decision, after the pandemic hit the East Coast, to travel to his family’s home in Ohio. Even though he wasn’t defying any quarantine or shelter-in-place orders at the time, he quickly realized that his trip could have dangerous repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“A lockdown can feel eerily draconian or downright authoritarian, and implementing a countrywide shelter-in-place mandate in the United States &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/coronavirus-quarantine-america-could-be-giant-legal-mess/606595/?utm_source=feed"&gt;would be a legal quagmire&lt;/a&gt;. So rather than waiting to see if the federal, state, and local governments demand it, Americans should take on the onus of holing themselves up at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="25" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/03/biography-new-coronavirus/608338/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Why the Coronavirus Has Been So Successful&lt;/a&gt;, by Ed Yong&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Understanding what all coronaviruses have in common is much easier than answering the question of what makes this one different. One way the virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be special is that the spikes unique to its surface can be easily split by an enzyme that’s found nearly everywhere in the human body, which gives the virus a fuller run of the respiratory system. And while other coronaviruses infect either the upper or lower airway, this one infects both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The structure of the virus provides some clues about its success. In shape, it’s essentially a spiky ball. Those spikes recognize and stick to a protein called ACE2, which is found on the surface of our cells: This is the first step to an infection. The exact contours of SARS-CoV-2’s spikes allow it to stick far more strongly to ACE2 than SARS-classic did, and “it’s likely that this is really crucial for person-to-person transmission,” says Angela Rasmussen of Columbia University. In general terms, the tighter the bond, the less virus required to start an infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="26" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/how-we-beat-coronavirus/608389/?utm_source=feed"&gt;This Is How We Can Beat the Coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;, by Aaron E. Carroll and Ashish Jha&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A March 16 report from Imperial College London projected that 2.2 million Americans could die of COVID-19 before the pandemic’s end if extreme measures aren’t enacted. Aaron E. Carroll, a pediatric specialist, and Ashish Jha, a global-health scholar, argue that extreme social-distancing measures can flatten the curve of infections, a goal that will above all else buy us time. With that time, standardized testing protocols can be developed, businesses can resume operations, and more complicated (but less extreme) measures—such as reopening community spaces with monitored entry—can be put in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Some Americans are in denial, and others are feeling despair. Both sentiments are understandable. We all have a choice to make. We can look at the coming fire and let it burn. We can hunker down and hope to wait it out—or we can work together to get through it with as little damage as possible. This country has faced massive threats before and risen to the challenge; we can do it again. We just need to decide to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="27" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-fever-ibuprofen/608233/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Should You Take Advil for COVID-19?&lt;/a&gt; By Olga Khazan&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A fever is part of the body’s retaliation against infection. So while some doctors recommend making yourself comfortable by taking Ibuprofen if you do have a fever, there’s also evidence that reducing fevers with medication can prolong some illnesses. Doctors still don’t know enough about COVID-19 to say definitively whether this is the case. While authorities including the French health minister have urged the public to avoid pain medications including ibuprofen if they suspect they have the coronavirus, others are torn on whether the potential risk is worse than suffering through a fever sans relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Multiple &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/let-it-burn-why-you-should-let-fevers-run-their-course"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; involving lizards, mice, or dogs, for instance, have found that infected animals that were prevented from having a fever were more likely to die. In &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16433601"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; of critically ill patients, those whose fevers above 101.3 degrees were treated with acetaminophen suffered more infections than those whose fevers went untreated. The study was stopped because seven patients in the treated-fever group had died, compared with just one in the untreated-fever group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But when this question was asked of a different doctor, Richard Klasco, in a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/well/live/fever-infection-drugs-tylenol-acetaminophen-ibuprofen-advil-aspirin.html"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in 2018, he came to a different conclusion: Treating a fever with painkillers had no effect at all. “Since rigorous clinical trials have shown that these drugs do not worsen outcomes,” Klasco told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, “why not make yourself comfortable?” Klasco told Khazan in an interview that he still stands by this advice.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A series of interviews with Daniel Horn, a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, provides a unique window into the fear and determination in America’s hospitals right now. One of Horn’s major concerns is protecting health-care workers so they can continue to treat others, even as protective supplies are running low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It would be great to see our collective society, our large corporations, consulting firms, logistics experts like Amazon, be thinking aggressively about how to rapidly either procure or manufacture personal protective equipment for health-care workers. Yes, we moved to social distancing. That is tremendous. The next thing that needs to be solved: We need personal protective equipment for our health-care workers, and then ventilators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Or, thinking aloud here: Corporations and global communities really ought to stand together to collect all the hoarded personal protective equipment, masks, Purell, surgical masks. In particular, no one in a house needs an N95 mask. They are in short supply. We should find a way to get them back out of houses, and into the hands of health-care workers. I don’t have a plan, and it would need to be a very thoughtful approach. What if a community put all their hoarded supplies on their front porches at the same time, one day during the week? Amazon could set up an operation to gather it. If we designed it right, we could make it safe and get those supplies back into hospitals.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In a mid-March interview with &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, shared his growing fears about the United States’ coronavirus prognosis. “If you wait until you’ve seen lots of affected cases, you know you’ve waited too late,” he warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Here’s what Collins said when asked what surprised him most about the coronavirus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The degree to which this is so rapidly transmissible. More so than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/"&gt;SARS&lt;/a&gt; was. SARS was a terribly scary situation for the world 18 years ago, but it never reached the level of infections or deaths that we have for this coronavirus, because it wasn’t as transmissible. SARS was transmissible but only from people who were really very sick. This one seems to be transmissible from people who have minor illness or maybe no illness at all—which is why it has been so difficult to get control or to know when you should be imposing these stringent measures we’ve been talking about.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-how-get-food-safely/608008/?utm_source=feed"&gt;How You Should Get Food During the Pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, by Amanda Mull&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Even as normal life grinds to a halt in the U.S., Americans still need to consider their most quotidian needs, eating among them. There’s no perfect way to get food without some human contact. If braving the crowded supermarket feels overwhelming, delivery can be a good option, but only if you put careful precautions in place (such as leaving money outside your door) and make ethical choices about when and how you order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The places people order from make a difference too. A local restaurant is a better choice than a start-up that sends gig workers with no health-care benefits into crowded big-box grocery stores to fight over dried beans on your behalf. The restaurant delivery person interacts with fewer people, lessening his or her individual risk, and the money you pay for the food goes toward keeping a restaurant’s staff employed through a crisis. In Wuhan, local delivery drivers were &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/business/china-coronavirus-wuhan-delivery.html"&gt;the city’s lifeline&lt;/a&gt; during a lockdown that made venturing out for fresh food difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Social distancing is one of the most important community-wide precautions that healthy people can take to slow or stop the spread of infectious disease, but what exactly that entails can be hard to pin down. Our writer Kaitlyn Tiffany asked three experts about subways and gyms (avoid unless absolutely necessary), meeting up with friends (try a walk in the park, six feet apart), work (do it from home if you can!), and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With few exceptions, now is the time to cancel get-togethers. Dating, family visits, house parties, should all be postponed or held virtually if possible. There are personal situations where you must go out for work, for supplies, or to help someone else in need. In those cases, take precautions to keep your distance from others, and wash your hands frequently. If you develop a fever or cough, don’t go out unless it is absolutely necessary or to seek medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="32" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/where-do-you-go-if-you-get-coronavirus/607759/?utm_source=feed"&gt;What Will You Do If You Start Coughing?&lt;/a&gt; by James Hamblin&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Preparation and protection is important, but it’s also crucial to know what steps you can take if you start to feel ill. In an ideal outbreak scenario, reliable testing would be available to all, but America’s already-strained public-health system has left many with less serious symptoms waiting for a test for days on end. For now, the most common recommendation is temporary self-isolation—a choice that’s going to be difficult for workers and caretakers to make without community or government assistance. One idea supported by some economists is that “everyone receive cash, immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;People need to feel able to skip work and still make rent and feed their family. They need cash without strings attached, and they need it now, not via a complex omnibus economic stimulus package next month … A pandemic is like a slow-motion hurricane that will hit the entire world. If the same amount of rain and wind is to hit us in any scenario, better to have it come over the course of a day than an hour. People will suffer either way, but spreading the damage out will allow as many people as possible to care for one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol start="33" type="1"&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/02/covid-vaccine/607000/?utm_source=feed"&gt;You’re Likely to Get the Coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;, by James Hamblin&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;COVID-19 is unlikely to kill most people who aren’t in high-risk groups (including the elderly and the immunocompromised). Still, you’re not likely to evade it. The new coronavirus drew early comparisons to 2003’s deadly SARS outbreak, but critical differences soon emerged. COVID-19’s relatively low death rate (which hovers somewhere between 2 and 3.4 percent) means that healthy-seeming people can act as unknowing carriers of the disease, allowing it to spread quickly. And it’s already too late for a vaccine to turn the tide, according to Richard Hatchett, the CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The emerging consensus among epidemiologists is that the most likely outcome of this outbreak is a new seasonal disease—a fifth ‘&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson1/section11.html"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt;’ coronavirus. With the other four, people are not known to develop long-lasting immunity. If this one follows suit, and if the disease continues to be as severe as it is now, ‘cold and flu season’ could become ‘cold and flu and COVID-19 season.’”&lt;/p&gt;

And on a macro level, what is happening to feelings and relationships in this strange time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: Ashley, what is happening to feelings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m glad you asked, because right now that seems to be my entire beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s tackle that first question—is it okay to text your ex right now? I think the reason why you text your ex is a big factor here. Some people are texting their exes right now out of boredom or loneliness. Some people are trying to satisfy some sort of lingering romantic or sexual desire when they don't really have access to new people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: This is happening right now, right? This is a trend that people are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, this is definitely happening. I first heard about it from people who were receiving these texts, and the recipients were asking, “Are anyone else’s exes coming out of the woodwork right now?” That gave me the tip that maybe this is something to look into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I looked into it. And what I found was that, yes, some people felt that their exes were texting them, getting back in touch after weeks, months, even years of radio silence, just because they were lonely and bored and maybe horny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other reason people are texting their exes is to patch things up or to clear the air or apologize. One of the more compelling things I heard in my reporting was something called terror-management theory, which is this idea that when people are confronted with their own mortality, they start to seek meaning. They start to think about religion more and also things like their personal relationships and their family relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people right now are confronting, some of them for the first time, this idea that death is very possible and very close. And they are feeling this impulse of &lt;em&gt;I should apologize to this person&lt;/em&gt; or maybe &lt;em&gt;I should clear the air and get back on good terms with this person&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;I should resolve this conflict that I let linger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: So it’s not about the other person. It’s about the reacher-outer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: As always, yes. A lot of these people are confronting this idea of &lt;em&gt;I could die&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: I like that your two alternatives are that people are either experiencing tremendous existential grief and trying to put things in order so that their soul can be at peace forever, or they’re horny. How would one go about distinguishing, if they were to read a text message, what the motive on the other end might be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: If you receive one of these text messages, or if you’re sending them, a “you up?” text has an air of impulsivity that’s palpable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you have a sense of how many of these reach-outs are genuinely motivated by concern for the other person? Do you think that’s happening a lot, or is it just weird stuff about mortality and sex?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: When I started reporting the story, I thought there was going to be a lot more shady, late-night drunk texting going on. And what I found was a lot of people who felt, for example, “I just really wanted to make sure that my ex-boyfriend’s grandma, who is immunocompromised, is okay.” Or: “I just thought this would be a good time to check in and give us something to be kind to each other about and get back on a good note together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has given a lot of people cover to reach out to their exes that they maybe wouldn’t have known how to reach out to before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: What about crushes? They’re reaching out, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, a lot of the same stuff applies here. The same reasons you would reach out to an ex during this time are sometimes the same reasons you would reach out to a crush to reveal your feelings to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the obvious things is that everyone’s bored, lonely, spending a lot more time with their own thoughts. And if you had some crush that you were spending a lot of time thinking about before, you’re probably thinking about them a lot more now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook, which owns Instagram as well as WhatsApp, wrote in a blog post late last month that it had seen a spike in user engagement over all its platforms and a 50 percent increase in direct messages between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: What are people doing, asking to go for walks? You can’t go to a show or a restaurant or a bar. You could go for a distanced walk where you’re pretty far apart, but you’re walking together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: Anecdotally, I have heard of people doing that, especially if they live in the same neighborhood or in neighborhoods that are a reasonable distance apart. They walk, meet at the same street corner, and then take a walk to a less crowded street and keep six feet of distance between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamblin&lt;/strong&gt;: I can’t imagine a more awkward thing. People are getting desperate. There’s always Zoom, though, right? Or do people not want to conduct their business and their dating life in the same place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: I think that’s a piece of it. And when I picture doing a date via Zoom, there’s so much I don’t know about the person on the other end. How do they walk? What is it like to be near them? How do they make me feel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells&lt;/strong&gt;: In addition to terror-management theory, you also wrote about the misattribution of arousal. Can you explain what that is?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a very famous &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0037031"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on this from the ’70s. They had men either cross a rickety, old, scary bridge or a really stable bridge. Then an attractive female researcher said to them, “Here’s a quick survey. Can you tell me what’s on your mind right now? You can call me next week if you want to know more about my studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that there was much more sexual content in the recollections of the men who had crossed the scary bridge than the ones who had crossed the stable bridge. And those men were also more likely to call the researcher later and be flirtatious with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was reporting this story on why people are confessing their crushes right now, one thing that a researcher said to me is that maybe people are mistaking the terror of the world outside right now for really intense feelings for the person that they like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells&lt;/strong&gt;: All of this is taking place in the context of a strange moment for relationships and dating in general. People who are together are really together now. And people who are not with people are very alone. Can you put this in context?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: This is an unprecedented curveball for every romantic relationship. One thing I do see coming out of this is a lot of relationships, especially new ones or ones that were on the wane, will be broken by it. And some will be very quickly accelerated by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I anticipate that we’ll see a wave of coronavirus engagements or maybe even coronavirus cohabitations from people who were previously hesitant to make that kind of commitment, but who see during this time that they like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you could also very easily discover the opposite: You de facto move in with someone and hate it, so you don’t continue the relationship. I think this will clarify and catalyze a lot of decisions for a lot of couples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells&lt;/strong&gt;: Did anyone give you guidance on why moments like these expose all of our nerve endings and cause us to be more open and honest?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetters&lt;/strong&gt;: I think that plays into the terror-management theory. Now is the time to seek meaning and interrogate how you really feel about things. How do you really feel about the life that you’ve lived? That’s part of what gets us to this place of unprecedented honesty with each other.&lt;/p&gt;</content><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/Text_Your_Ex/lead_960.jpg"></media:content><title type="html">Listen: Should You Text Your Ex?</title><published>2020-04-20T09:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T10:19:40-04:00</updated><summary type="html">A guide to dating realities during the pandemic</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/text-your-ex/610240/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:178-610198</id><content type="html">&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" src="https://www.theatlantic.com/video/iframe/610198/"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 2019 drew to a close, a young woman, Niuniu, and her fiancé, Tongsheng, looked forward to a bright future. In the spring, as the cherry blossoms fell in Wuhan, the couple would get married. They had started saving up to buy a house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a month later, however, their dreams came to a grinding halt. An animated short documentary from Olmo Parenti, based on a series of Niuniu’s WeChats, tells the heartrending story of Tongsheng’s battle with COVID-19. Like many victims of this pandemic, Tongsheng had difficulty accessing medical care. In mid-January, he died alone in a hospital waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federica Fruhwirth’s animations bring Niuniu and Tongsheng’s tragic story to life with a simplicity that foregrounds Niuniu’s narration. “The goal was to let the viewer focus on the narration and the temporal escalation in events,” Parenti told me, “We didn’t want the animations to be frenetic and exciting; we wanted the visuals to match the delicacy and pace of Niuniu’s writing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most affecting part of Niuniu’s story is a letter that Tongsheng wrote, addressed to Niuniu’s future boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Congratulations on being Niuniu’s boyfriend!” the letter reads. “I envy you because you have my same talent. You managed to be with a woman so beautiful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reading that letter was a heartbreaking experience,” Parenti said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter goes on to lightheartedly warn the future boyfriend of Niuniu’s shortcomings—and to encourage him to love her unconditionally nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Emily Buder</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/emily-buder/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2020/04/Boyfriend_Wuhan/lead_960.jpg"></media:content><title type="html">‘My Boyfriend Died of COVID-19’</title><published>2020-04-20T15:21:42-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T15:21:42-04:00</updated><summary type="html">In Wuhan, a young woman and her fiancé’s dreams are shattered.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/610198/boyfriend-died-in-wuhan/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610303</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every weekday evening, our editors guide you through the biggest stories of the day, help you discover new ideas, and surprise you with moments of delight. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Subscribe to get this delivered to your inbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="378" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/original_2-9/69e37983a.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;OLIVER MUNDAY&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Argument of the Day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The pandemic didn’t break America.

Madrigal and Robinson Meyer, who launched &lt;a href="https://covidtracking.com/"&gt;a project tracking state-by-state testing progress&lt;/a&gt;, write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One statistic highlights the extent of the cases that the U.S. could be missing. Alexis and Rob evaluated a metric called the test-positivity rate, which estimates how many people who are tested for the virus are found to have it. In the U.S., that rate is 20 percent. That’s very high—and implies that doctors are testing only those patients with a very high likelihood of having the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The positivity rate doesn’t tell us the proportion of coronavirus cases in the U.S., but it can give us a general sense of how drastic a particular outbreak is. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/us-coronavirus-outbreak-out-control-test-positivity-rate/610132/?utm_source=feed"&gt;In America’s case, it shows that the outbreak is far from under control.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to read if … you just want practical advice:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;

It’s time to figure out better ways to live together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to call what my extended family lives in a commune. My husband, teenage daughters, and I live in a ramshackle old house. When we bought the place, a law-school student was living in a tiny house in the backyard. Soon she graduated and we bought that house too. My father-in-law was declining into dementia, so he and my mother-in-law moved in there. We helped her with his care, which wasn’t easy, because he had a tendency to wander. (Since then, he’s passed away, but my mother-in-law still lives in our backyard.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, a few years later, the house next door came on the market. My own parents were also having health problems but lived in a remote mountain community without a hospital. My brother bought the house for them, and now they live there part-time. During the summer, my brother, who is not married, lives there as well. We knocked down the fence between our homes and put down a path. This has been great for us as parents, because we always have a family member to help with child care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our forged family includes “orphaned” seniors who have moved to town to enjoy this community, old friends cut off from their own families, a homeless woman who for a time slept on my mother-in-law’s tiny kitchen floor, a former nun, a recent widower, and anyone else who doesn’t have a place to go on a holiday. My daughters grew up thinking this is normal, and in my family it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melodie Edwards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Laramie, Wyo.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Brooks writes that in primitive societies, people who migrated together formed a band. That is still true today in the U.S. I grew up in two extended families. The first was purely familial: three generations of grandparents, parents, and children plus assorted uncles all living together. But there was another extended family as well: the White Russian émigrés who fled communism. The members of that large extended family did not share a house, except in some cases, but lived close to one another and joined forces to raise children, start businesses, refer one another to jobs, build churches, and care for the elderly. The article mentions that recent immigrants to the U.S. are more likely to live in extended-kinship families; nonbiological kinship gives extra resilience to these communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lena S. Zezulin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Takoma Park, Md.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed David Brooks’s informative and insightful article on the American nuclear family, but I think he is seriously misguided by the notion that progressives lack an understanding of and commitment to conventional family structures. He writes, “Progressives have no philosophy of family life at all.” This is simply not true. That progressives are tolerant of unconventional domestic arrangements does not mean they are oblivious or indifferent to the great personal and social rewards of conventional family life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Juneau, Alaska&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks provides an accurate picture of how the family once was and how it has disintegrated. However, he leaves out the exciting formation of other kinds of ties that stretch kinship in unprecedented ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my own research on donor-sibling networks, I have found that parents and their donor-conceived children are voluntarily taking unique steps to counter the shrinking family by finding other families who happened to have purchased the same donor’s gametes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a child who had no siblings has a dozen. Moreover, these genetic relatives (who start out as strangers) are exploring what it means to be related and connected to one another. They say they feel naturally comfortable together because they share genes—and they look for resemblances and similarities that reinforce belonging to the same kinship group. As siblings, they feel a moral responsibility to one another even if they have not grown up in the same household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanna Hertz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Can you comment more on the reason(s) for that selection? — &lt;i&gt;Nancy Barba, Portland, Maine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;I chose 1965 because that’s about the moment when divorce rates began to spike and more unmarried people started having children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: &lt;/b&gt;Is the nuclear family the problem, or is it how we’ve changed our lifestyles—or how our world has forced us to change our lifestyles? — &lt;i&gt;Ted David, Hyattsville, Md. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;Family structures change, along with lifestyle and all sorts of other social arrangements, because of an underlying shift in consciousness. Around 1965, a communal “we first” consciousness was replaced by an individualistic “me first” consciousness. That produced a range of other changes across sectors. The evidence clearly indicates, to me at least, that culture drives history even more than economics and technology do. When you get a shift in values, everything else follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: &lt;/b&gt;How can one write an article of this sort and fail to acknowledge the role that religious belief and communities have had in mitigating the fallout from family breakdown by acting as the chosen community/family? — &lt;i&gt;Alisha Ruiss, Montreal, Quebec&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: &lt;/b&gt;You are right to point to the importance of religion. I’ve received a lot of responses from clergy members to this article. None said they were motivated to urge their flock to return to bigger extended families. All of them said they were motivated to make their own congregation into more of a forged family. Perhaps the only way to get young people back to church is to make it the place where family happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Facts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we learned fact-checking our new podcast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/floodlines/?utm_source=feed"&gt;our new podcast &lt;i&gt;Floodlines&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Vann R. Newkirk II revisits one of the biggest questions of Hurricane Katrina: Why did the levees fail?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 80 percent of New Orleans flooded in 2005, blame fell on the Army Corps of Engineers, which built the breached levees near Lake Pontchartrain. Numerous studies—including the Corps’s own 6,000-page report—detailed the many mistakes. One conclusion, not mentioned in &lt;i&gt;Floodlines&lt;/i&gt; but uncovered while fact-checking the show, sticks out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steel sheet piles used to anchor the New Orleans floodwalls against a potential hurricane surge were driven about half as deep into the ground as they should have been. This construction error was the result of an oversight in 1985: Corps researchers had made recommendations about the sheet piles’ ideal depth based on a study in which the view of a test floodwall was partially obscured. Experts now speculate that the test floodwall—like the actual floodwalls—was slightly tilted, allowing water to seep beneath and destabilize it. What blocked their view? A tarp that had been draped over the wall and was concealing its base—and the gap that had likely formed there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shorter, shallower sheet piles reduced the price of the floodwalls by approximately $100 million—but cost hundreds of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;William Brennan&lt;/strong&gt;, Floodlines &lt;em&gt;fact-checker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Behind the May Cover&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cover-design process starts with anxious pangs: &lt;i&gt;What should we make?

Our director of photography, Luise Stauss, suggested that we use childlike drawings to visually represent the complexity of the disorder. She and I worked closely with our associate art director Katie Martin to develop variations on this theme.

Medical care is limited, and basic protective measures—social distancing, wearing masks, frequent hand-washing—are often impossible. The regular flow of new detainees, plus the coming and going of corrections staff, creates a steady risk of exposure. The government has implored Americans to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, even as it violates every single one of them in many of its own institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conditions have set the stage for disaster. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/rikers-island-jail-coronavirus-public-health-disaster"&gt;Rikers Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/coronavirus-cook-county-jail-chicago.html"&gt;Cook County Jail&lt;/a&gt;, which were swiftly and brutally overwhelmed by the virus early on, are thus a sign of things to come.

Nobody should be &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/americas-innocent-prisoners-are-going-die-there/609133/?utm_source=feed"&gt;forced to risk deadly exposure to COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; while awaiting trial or facing potential deportation, when experts have identified effective mitigation strategies: &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/03/coronavirus-jails-bail-reform-arrests/"&gt;limiting new arrests and detentions&lt;/a&gt; to those who clearly threaten public safety; requiring &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/make-soap-free-prisons/609202/?utm_source=feed"&gt;improved testing, hygiene, and isolation protocols&lt;/a&gt; in detention facilities; and &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-release-more-prison-cuomo-20200415-smib6uwwarbuvjnygbpqmn5zja-story.html"&gt;releasing as many people as possible&lt;/a&gt; who do not pose a clear risk of flight or dangerousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, jurisdictions are &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/initial-court-responses-covid-19-leave-patchwork-policies"&gt;all over in the map&lt;/a&gt; in how quickly and effectively they have &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZOs8LtiPajxjAiKDn4VwDnhng0AkDrMi/view"&gt;embraced these strategies&lt;/a&gt;. The federal government ranks &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/06/covid-19s-threat-prisons-argues-releasing-at-risk-offenders/"&gt;among the worst offenders&lt;/a&gt;; Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Justice Department have proved stingy, opaque, and often arbitrary in their response to the escalating crisis in their own detention facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not only callous and cruel; it is also unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people are charged with crimes or detained by immigration officials, they retain certain fundamental rights. Government officials cannot lock them in cells and disclaim responsibility for their fate. This reflects Americans’ shared commitment to the rule of law, belief in human dignity, and proudest national traditions. District Judge John E. Jones III expressed the point well in &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/03/31/judge-orders-immediate-release-group-people-immigration-detention-york-county-prison-new-coronavirus/5094681002/"&gt;a recent decision&lt;/a&gt;: “Our Constitution and laws apply equally to the most vulnerable among us … This is true even for those who have lost a measure of their freedom. If we are to remain the civilized society we hold ourselves out to be, it would be heartless and inhumane not to recognize [their] plight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government’s reaction to COVID-19 in jails and ICE detention facilities must follow settled legal precedent on acceptable conditions of confinement. The pandemic does not change that clear obligation. American officials must adhere to the Constitution, now more than ever, for the consequences of failure are dire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/release-ice-detainees/608536/?utm_source=feed"&gt;John Sandweg: I used to run ICE. We need to release the nonviolent detainees.&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First consider the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment"&gt;due-process clause of the Fifth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;. The Supreme Court has held that this provision &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/99-7791P.ZO"&gt;protects immigrants in ICE custody&lt;/a&gt;. The Fifth Amendment also &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-6368_7lhn.pdf"&gt;safeguards pretrial detainees&lt;/a&gt;, who have been charged with a crime but not yet tried—and who, by law and custom, must be presumed innocent. Under Fifth Amendment jurisprudence, when the government takes a person into custody, it &lt;a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/441/520/"&gt;cannot inflict punitive conditions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/509/25"&gt;affirmatively place that person in danger and then act with deliberate indifference&lt;/a&gt;, or otherwise &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/489/189"&gt;fail to provide for their basic human needs&lt;/a&gt; (including medical care and reasonable safety).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the conditions at many ICE detention facilities, as well as state and federal jails, Fifth Amendment violations are likely widespread. Simply put, the government cannot constitutionally seize and detain people, subject them to a substantial risk of exposure to COVID-19, and then insist that inaction or half measures are acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article241966876.html"&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/civil-rights-groups-sue-ice-to-force-release-of-detainees-vulnerable-to-covid-19/"&gt;filed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/coronavirus/2020/03/21/coronavirus-nj-ice-detainees-county-jails-sue-demand-release/2891489001/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.aclusandiego.org/aclu-lawsuit-demands-release-of-immigrant-detainees-vulnerable-to-covid-19-infection/"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://kywnewsradio.radio.com/articles/news/advocates-seek-release-of-jailed-immigrants-due-to-covid-19"&gt;past&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bronxdefenders.org/bronx-defenders-and-legal-aid-sue-for-immediate-release-of-clients-at-high-risk-of-covid-19-from-immigrant-detention/"&gt;weeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;—including &lt;/u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aclusocal.org/en/press-releases/aclu-sues-ice-over-conditions-adelanto-center-rife-covid-19"&gt;class-action lawsuits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;—&lt;/u&gt;have sought to force ICE to comply with that principle.

(I brought that case with &lt;a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/"&gt;Public Counsel&lt;/a&gt; and my colleagues at &lt;a href="https://www.kaplanhecker.com/"&gt;Kaplan Hecker &amp;amp; Fink LLP&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-207_d18e.pdf"&gt;paraphrase the late Justice Antonin Scalia&lt;/a&gt;, ICE’s defense “taxes the credulity of the credulous.” Its main argument is that immigrants are &lt;em&gt;safer&lt;/em&gt; in detention facilities than they were at home. This assertion defies &lt;a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/tools/assets/files/1330.pdf"&gt;common sense, expert opinion, and all available evidence&lt;/a&gt;. As the New York federal defender David Patton has remarked, “It feels a bit like arguing with the Flat Earth Society.” Even in ICE facilities that don’t yet have confirmed COVID-19 cases—which likely reflects a near-total absence of testing—the arrival of a single asymptomatic carrier could wreak &lt;a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/tools/assets/files/1328.pdf"&gt;havoc undetectable until it’s too late&lt;/a&gt;. No rational person would feel safer in an ICE detention facility than self-isolating at home with family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/ice-detainees-coronavirus-covid-19/608920/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: ‘We are like sitting ducks’&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Fifth Amendment cases against ICE are still in their early stages, many federal judges have ordered emergency relief. Some have required that bond hearings be fast-tracked; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/us-judge-orders-ice-to-say-how-many-detained-migrants-are-being-released-under-expanded-coronavirus-medical-reviews/2020/04/09/aaecf0b0-79b6-11ea-9bee-c5bf9d2e3288_story.html"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/us/coronavirus-migrant-children-detention-flores.html"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; required ICE to quickly create, implement, and report on prevention and release strategies; and still others have directed the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-27/citing-virus-judge-orders-release-of-two-men-from-california-immigrant-detention-center"&gt;immediate release of detainees&lt;/a&gt;. Another judge &lt;a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/fraihat_-_order_denying_mtd.pdf"&gt;recently certified&lt;/a&gt; a nationwide class challenging ICE’s systematic failure to uphold the Fifth Amendment in its medical care, mental health care, and disability accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These opinions affirm that the Fifth Amendment remains a vital safeguard for detainee rights, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; amid the COVID-19 pandemic. As District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. &lt;a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/tools/assets/files/1329.pdf"&gt;reasoned&lt;/a&gt;—while ordering the release of my clients in Los Angeles—“In the time of a crisis, our response to those at particularly high risk must be with compassion and not apathy. The Government cannot act with a callous disregard for the safety of our fellow human beings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the success of Fifth Amendment arguments in many ICE cases, they have thus far gotten less traction in challenges brought by pretrial detainees against their jailers. A federal judge in Chicago has &lt;a href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/federal-judge-orders-covid-19-safety-measures-for-chicago-area-inmates-a-second-detainee-dies"&gt;ordered improved protocols&lt;/a&gt; at the Cook County Jail, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., &lt;a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/district-judge-denies-request-to-release-dc-inmates-orders-better-protections-against-covid-19/2278665/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1587430827883000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNF08AyGmTPNurAagSGRGlYMtb5vnA" href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/district-judge-denies-request-to-release-dc-inmates-orders-better-protections-against-covid-19/2278665/" target="_blank"&gt;has ordered&lt;/a&gt; extensive reforms at D.C. jails, and a federal judge in Brooklyn has &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-mdc-brooklyn-test-protocol-20200414-fktlwq7b3jaxnf2cm7joyhggla-story.html"&gt;accelerated a suit&lt;/a&gt; aimed at the Metropolitan Detention Center, but other federal judges have proven reticent about granting emergency relief to those awaiting trial. In their opinions, these judges have &lt;a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/illinois/ilndce/1:2020cv02093/374996/38/"&gt;expressed anxiety&lt;/a&gt; about releasing accused criminals without a highly individualized assessment of their flight risk and dangerousness. Such a personal, fact-intensive assessment usually occurs not in constitutional lawsuits but in criminal cases as part of standard bail determinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This judicial anxiety is understandable, but it should not foreclose all relief. Where jailers violate the Constitution, courts &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txsd.1775018/gov.uscourts.txsd.1775018.40.0.pdf"&gt;can and should&lt;/a&gt; enter injunctions requiring improved safety protocols, regular public reporting, inspections by third-party experts, and, if necessary, progress toward releasing enough detainees to meet baseline constitutional standards. However difficult these judgments might be, total abdication is far more perilous. Constitutional values mean little if the country doesn’t uphold them when times are tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How the pandemic will end&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, if the Fifth Amendment proves ineffectual for pretrial detainees, they will have to rely heavily on &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment"&gt;the Sixth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; as they seek protection from the virus—in particular, the Sixth Amendment’s right to “the Assistance of Counsel” in criminal cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to overstate the importance of access to counsel for pretrial detainees. As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals &lt;a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/19-1778/19-1778-2020-03-20.pdf?ts=1584741604"&gt;recently stated&lt;/a&gt;, the “legitimacy of our criminal justice system” depends on defendants’ right to consult with legal counsel about bail hearings, plea negotiations, ongoing investigations, and trial strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since COVID-19 emerged, that has only grown more true. Speedy and public trials are &lt;a href="https://www.theusconstitution.org/blog/covid-19-endangers-not-just-public-health-but-the-constitution/"&gt;a thing of the past&lt;/a&gt;. Judges and juries are sheltering in place, even as criminal prosecutions slowly inch forward. This puts many pretrial detainees in a frighteningly precarious position. They are stuck in jails with much higher risks of exposure to COVID-19—and much less access to quality health care—but without any end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/california-scales-back-rights-defendants/609433/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Conor Friedersdorf: Even now, criminal defendants have rights&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these circumstances, access to counsel is paramount, especially for the &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/dygq4m/thousands-of-pre-trial-detainees-are-at-risk-of-coronavirus-just-because-theyre-poor"&gt;&lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/dygq4m/thousands-of-pre-trial-detainees-are-at-risk-of-coronavirus-just-because-theyre-poor"&gt; detainees&lt;/a&gt; whose age or medical conditions put them in high-risk categories. It is through defense counsel that these men and women can seek bail, temporary release, transfer, compassionate release, or other relief—and thus obtain the individualized assessment that courts have urged in Fifth Amendment cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in some jurisdictions, the same virus that endangers pretrial detainees has also sabotaged their access to counsel. This has become a &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/04/05/coronavirus-federal-prison-mdc-mcc-new-york/"&gt;full-blown crisis in New York City&lt;/a&gt;. There, the federal jails have &lt;a href="https://www.kaplanhecker.com/newsroom/nyc-prisons-rebuked-blocking-sick-inmates-phone-calls"&gt;ceased all attorney visits, fumbled in setting up limited videoconferences, and sharply limited phone access&lt;/a&gt;. As of last week, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/04/05/coronavirus-federal-prison-mdc-mcc-new-york/"&gt;nearly 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of attorney requests to speak with clients went nowhere. Things have gotten so bad that some attorneys have been forced to file bail applications without even speaking to their clients first—which puts them at a gross disadvantage in explaining why immediate release is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is untenable. The government cannot proceed with criminal cases, detain people in high-risk jails, reflexively resist calls for their release, and then restrict access to lawyers who seek to protect them from dangerous conditions. The Sixth Amendment stands against such abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, that principle is no novelty. More than a year ago, the federal defenders of New York (represented by me and my law-firm colleagues) &lt;a href="https://www.kaplanhecker.com/newsroom/defenders-group-files-lawsuit-over-deteriorating-conditions-federal-prison-brooklyn"&gt;sued the Bureau of Prisons&lt;/a&gt; for failing to protect Sixth Amendment rights at the federal jail in Brooklyn. In their suit, the federal defenders invoked a wealth of history and precedent confirming that jailers must ensure consistent access to counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late March, the Second Circuit &lt;a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/19-1778/19-1778-2020-03-20.pdf?ts=1584741604"&gt;issued a powerful decision&lt;/a&gt; allowing this case to proceed—and confirming the role of courts in ensuring “that constitutional boundaries are not transgressed by considerations of expediency.” District Judge Margo Brodie has since &lt;a href="https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/litigation/publications/loretta-lynch-s-appointment-as-mediator-in-brooklyn-prison-lawsuit-featured-in-law360?id=32219"&gt;appointed former Attorney General Loretta Lynch&lt;/a&gt; to help mediate the dispute. In these proceedings and elsewhere, the federal defenders have repeatedly raised concerns about inadequate access to counsel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, progress remains extremely limited, well short of what the Constitution requires. Whether the federal government will meet its legal obligations to those it has detained in New York City is quite uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is true throughout the nation. These are scary times for everyone, but they are especially scary for the millions of people locked in detention. As they cry out for protection from the virus, the Constitution forbids indifference and inaction. It instead requires that the government take concrete, effective measures to save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principles that the United States and its officials articulate now—and the precedents that are set through their conduct—will endure far beyond this particular crisis. They will forever shape the country’s law and ideals. They will become part of the Constitution itself. All Americans must therefore heed the better angels of their nature, lest the nation betray its deepest values.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joshua Matz</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/joshua-matz/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/0420_Rosen_Martin_COVIDPrison2/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>ivan-96 / emarys / Getty / Katie Martin / The Atlantic</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Coronavirus Is Testing America’s Commitment to People’s Constitutional Rights</title><published>2020-04-20T06:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T11:25:31-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The government’s reaction to COVID-19 in jails and ICE detention facilities must follow settled legal precedent on acceptable conditions of confinement.

The Hanna-Barbera cartoon had launched in 1969, two years after my birth, so it was precisely in my little-kid sweet spot. Much as I loved it, though, the feeble animation and repetitive plots were apparent even to the young me. Whereas characters such as Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny seemed eternal, extending far into the past and future, &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo &lt;/i&gt;felt like a show just for that particular moment, for my specific childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward 35 years or so, and to my astonishment, my children loved it just as much as I had. I probably wound up watching more &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt; episodes with my kids than I had watched &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; a kid. Evidence suggests that my experience is not unique. Scooby-Doo, believe it or not, has over the years been the subject of at least 19 TV series (on CBS, ABC, the WB, Cartoon Network, and Boomerang); more than 40 animated films; and two live-action movies in the early 2000s, the first of which grossed $275 million worldwide. A new series featuring celebrity-guest voices, &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?&lt;/i&gt;, premiered last year. And a new animated movie, &lt;i&gt;Scoob!&lt;/i&gt;, starring Zac Efron, Amanda Seyfried, and Tracy Morgan, is scheduled to be released in mid-May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which raises the obvious question: What on earth is going on? Why has &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/14/movies/film-review-if-the-saturday-morning-show-wasn-t-enough.html"&gt;described by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; film critic A. O. Scott&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 as “one of the cheapest, least original products of modern American juvenile culture”—outlasted not only such Hanna-Barbera brethren as &lt;i&gt;The Flintstones&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Yogi Bear&lt;/i&gt;, but also pretty much everything else on television? &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;’s Hank Stuever once &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/06/14/scooby-doo-theres-nothing-to-do-but-dig-it/81316e38-155d-4d27-ae21-ff89ec7dd29a/"&gt;summed up the cartoon’s message as&lt;/a&gt; “Kids should meddle, dogs are sweet, life is groovy, and if something scares you, you should confront it.” But that hardly seems enough for half a century of on-air appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The essential premise, for those not weaned on the show, is straightforward. A group of four teenagers—some of whom seem considerably older (more on this in a moment)—and a Great Dane, Scooby-Doo, drive around in a van called the Mystery Machine in search of, yes, mysteries. (The gang, like its later Hanna-Barbera cousin, &lt;i&gt;Josie and the Pussycats&lt;/i&gt;, was originally conceived as a band that would play a musical number each episode.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mystery they find almost always appears at first to be paranormal—a vindictive ghost or ghoul, a rampaging dinosaur—but is ultimately revealed as an elaborate hoax involving disguises, holograms, hidden wires, phosphorescent paint, or some combination thereof. Each time the gang unmasks the genuine villain, typically male and on the older side, he utters some variation of “And I would’ve gotten away with it if not for you meddling kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="callout-placeholder" data-source="curated"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mystery Inc. members are Fred, the blond, broad-shouldered presumptive leader of the group (who wears, implausibly, an ascot); Daphne, the fashion-conscious redhead and semi-comical damsel in distress (a stereotype that the show subverted in its later iterations); Velma, the frumpishly sweatered and bespectacled brainiac; and Shaggy, the ever-famished slacker-coward defined by his prominent slouch and chin grizzle. Scooby himself—his name was inspired by Frank Sinatra’s “dooby dooby doo” scat in “Strangers in the Night”—is inseparable from Shaggy and in many ways indistinguishable: same appetite, same poltroonery, same plot functions. Essentially split aspects of the same character, the two are not id and superego, but something closer to id and more id. A typical story line involves Daphne getting kidnapped or otherwise endangered; Fred devising a Rube Goldberg–esque, and spectacularly unsuccessful, trap to ensnare the villain; and the case being wrapped up by a blend of Velma’s smarts and Shaggy/Scooby’s bumbling good luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show owed its launch in part to complaints that Saturday-morning cartoons—including Hanna-Barbera’s &lt;i&gt;Space Ghost&lt;/i&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/13/entertainment/scooby-doo-50th-anniversary-history-trnd/index.html"&gt;were becoming too violent&lt;/a&gt;. So the producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera (along with the story writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, and the animator Iwao Takamoto) decided that their new show wouldn’t merely solve mysteries; it would demystify them altogether. As any parent knows, the surest way to comfort kids is to offer them an alternative explanation for the horrors that go bump in the night: It was the cat, or the wind, or the uncle who forgot where the guest room was. In the premiere of &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt;, “What a Night for a Knight,” the ambulatory suit of armor freaking everyone out is discovered to be Mr. Wickles, the seemingly hapless museum curator who is also (gasp!) a secret art smuggler. Case closed. Sleep tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No less an arbiter of reality than Carl Sagan hailed the show as a “public service … in which paranormal claims are systematically investigated and every case is found to be explicable in prosaic terms.” Later variations of the show tried tweaking the formula. Some featured real monsters (including a 1985 miniseries titled &lt;i&gt;The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt;, starring Vincent Price as the warlock Vincent Van Ghoul). One, &lt;i&gt;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt;, recast the gang as elementary-school-aged. And characters were regularly subtracted or added—notably Scrappy-Doo, Scooby’s pint-size and pugnacious nephew. But the show consistently returned to its core premise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that Nancy Drew and the Hardy boys had long since established the template of liberated teens outsmarting adult crooks, surely the show’s enduring success rests on more than that. Having a friendly dog involved has helped, certainly, though placing a Great Dane front and center is no guarantee of universal popularity, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2010/06/no-one-has-anything-positive-to-say-about-marmaduke/345331/?utm_source=feed"&gt;as Marmaduke fans will sadly inform you&lt;/a&gt;. A more telling clue, I think, can be found in the show’s timing. It debuted during a period of acute generational conflict and anxiety: the Vietnam/Nixon years, the “Never trust anyone over 30” years. Whether by accident or design, the makeup of the Mystery Inc. gang played perfectly into that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fundamental division has always prevailed within the group, occasionally hinted at but rarely made explicit, between Fred and Daphne on the one hand and Velma and Shaggy/Scooby on the other. The former looked and sounded older; the idea that Fred and Daphne were a couple (or an ex-couple) has been frequently suggested. And how else to account for that deepest mystery of the Scoobyverse—Fred’s fondness for his orange ascot? On some level, viewers are intended to see him as a grown-up. Daphne is a slightly more complicated case. But her maybe-relationship with Fred, her overt sexualization (her outfits, unlike Velma’s, are aggressively formfitting), and the eventual revelation that her family wealth supports Mystery Inc. clearly position her as the second quasi-adult in the group. She even has a scarf that mirrors Fred’s ascot—neckwear as a signifier of maturity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Velma, who is cited as the youngest of the gang, stands out as the quintessential TV representation of the smart, awkward teenager, right down to the glasses without which she is virtually blind. She has also been rumored for decades among fans to be gay, or at least bisexual. James Gunn, who wrote the screenplay for the 2002 live-action film, said he was “pretty sure” Velma is gay; Linda Cardellini, who played the character, described her sexuality as “a little ambiguous.” A kiss—relatively chaste—between Velma and Daphne was even shot for the film as a kind of inside joke, though it didn’t make the final cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaggy, meanwhile, has consistently been reputed to be a stoner, thanks to his slovenly look, his persistent case of the munchies, and his addiction, shared by Scooby, to a treat called “Scooby Snacks.” (The 2002 movie has fun with the stoner myth, too.) Throw in the fact that Shaggy was voiced for the better part of four decades by Casey Kasem, the DJ responsible for &lt;i&gt;American Top 40&lt;/i&gt;, and the character was a walking bundle of youth-culture signifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What better way to toy, below the surface, with the cultural tensions of the late ’60s and early ’70s? Juxtapose two borderline misfits in Velma and Shaggy—who are perhaps experimenting a little with sexuality and drugs—with two grown-up stand-ins for the more conventional sort in Fred and Daphne, and then let the offbeat characters consistently (yet all in good fun) one-up the establishment types. Even the show’s signature line, “And I would’ve gotten away with it if not for you meddling kids,” sounds like it could have been uttered by Richard Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the genius of the young mystery hunters is that they were not prisoners of their era. (In fact, they were based explicitly on characters from an earlier show, &lt;i&gt;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&lt;/i&gt;—one of the first TV series to make teenagers leading characters—in which a pre-Gilligan Bob Denver played Maynard G. Krebs, a kind of proto-Shaggy, right down to the chin scruff.) You don’t have to envision the group’s internal dialectic as the counterculture versus the establishment. The show’s longevity demonstrates that the metaphor works equally well as outsiders versus popular kids. Or, most primally, as children versus parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, over the past 50 years the &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt; characters have become almost archetypal, Joseph Campbell–worthy portraits of teenagerdom. Watch just about any ensemble teen show or movie, and you’ll find your Freds and Daphnes (often as foils or outright villains) and your Velmas and Shaggys. Perhaps no one applied this paradigm more self-consciously than the writer-director Joss Whedon in &lt;i&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/i&gt;, which winked at its predecessor by imagining a group of teen monster-fighters led by a superhero version of Daphne. Buffy and her pals even referred to themselves as the “Scoobies.” Whedon later claimed, tongue only partly in cheek, “All great fiction is &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt;-like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we watch—and our kids watch, and eventually &lt;i&gt;their &lt;/i&gt;kids will watch—four so-called teenagers and their Great Dane roam the countryside, pulling the mask off some fraudulent phantom or counterfeit creeper. They’ll be headed for your local multiplex soon enough. And fear not: They won’t ever really leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article appears in the May 2020 print edition with the headline “The Secret of &lt;/em&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;em&gt;’s Enduring Appeal.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Christopher Orr</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/christopher-orr/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2020/04/Scoobs_PM_Homepage/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>John-Paul Steele / Barcroft Media / Getty / The Atlantic</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Secret of &lt;em&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/em&gt;’s Enduring Appeal</title><published>2020-04-19T09:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-19T09:00:09-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Why on earth has the formulaic series, which debuted half a century ago, outlasted just about everything else on television?</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/05/the-secret-of-scooby-doos-enduring-appeal/609091/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610243</id><content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="An illustration of a hand holding up a bar graph." height="488" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/04/TheAtlantic_Covid19_R1_V3_01/cd8cfc3fa.jpg" width="480"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Anthony Gerace&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the past few weeks the United States has witnessed an unprecedented spike in jobless claims that has overwhelmed state agencies. Alongside a health crisis and an economic crisis, we are now entering into a devastating period of mass unemployment, one that—&lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043237"&gt;decades of research&lt;/a&gt; tell us—will leave deep financial and psychological scars for the workers and families trapped within it. Today, Americans across party lines recognize the need to act quickly to minimize this harm, but that bipartisan support will soon fade, as it has in past recessions. If Congress and state governments are going to pass forward-thinking legislation to help unemployed and precariously employed workers, now is the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Having researched the experiences of unemployed workers over the past &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/sociology/users/osharone"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://victortanchen.com/"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, we expect that the coming unemployment crisis will have two distinct phases. In the first phase, the country will largely respond with a sense of solidarity and compassion for the millions who have lost their jobs. Americans will recognize that external forces—the coronavirus and government policies to create social distance—have triggered these mass layoffs, and they will see the plight of unemployed workers in that light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Those who lose their jobs will struggle to make ends meet in a stand-still economy, but they will at least be spared some of the blame leveled against the jobless in other economic downturns. When more than 20 million people file for unemployment in a month, even the hard-hearted will have trouble &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/sunday/deaths-despair-poverty.html"&gt;casting them&lt;/a&gt; as idlers or parasites. As a result, there should be sufficient political will to continue generous government support—perhaps even expanding upon the $2 trillion stimulus package that Congress recently passed, which dramatically boosts unemployment benefits and extends them to gig workers and other people who normally don’t qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/the-us-should-just-write-checksbut-wont/609637/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Mehrsa Baradaran: The U.S. should just send checks—but won’t&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Eventually, the outbreak will subside, and economic conditions will improve. Yet, for workers who remain unemployed, the situation will worsen. We are likely to see a repeat of the unemployment crisis of the Great Recession—but the underlying dynamics will be amplified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During this second phase, companies will begin to rehire workers. If the past is any guide, many employers will use this opportunity to replace some of their former workers with cheaper and more contingent labor. During normal economic times, slashing wages or stripping away job security prompts a backlash of protest and bad publicity. But lowering such labor costs is easy when the economy is stalled and workers are grateful for any opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;More broadly, the crisis will accelerate some &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/01/white-working-class-poverty/424341/?utm_source=feed"&gt;long-running market trends&lt;/a&gt; toward industry consolidation (which reduces one’s choice of potential employers), automation (in which machines replace human labor), and worker precarity (which happens when the convenience of employers and customers entirely overrides the well-being of individual workers). Even with the payroll subsidies that the stimulus legislation provides to small businesses, the prolonged shutdown will likely destroy many mom-and-pop businesses that have already suffered from decades of brutal competition with the likes of Walmart and Amazon. One thing that kept service jobs from being automated was the sense that customers prefer human interaction, but social distancing has enhanced the appeal of self-service kiosks—and even delivery drones. Once the pandemic subsides, people may go back to their old habits, but corporations do not typically let such opportunities for cutting costs go to waste—as we have seen whenever efforts to organize workers prompt employers to suddenly bring in more computers and robots, outsource work to contractors, or move jobs entirely offshore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Given how employers are likely to act in response to the economic downturn, many of those now laid off may well remain unemployed for a prolonged period. In particular, companies eager to hold down payroll costs will hesitate to hire back &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/business/economy/out-of-work-out-of-benefits-and-running-out-of-options.html"&gt;older and more experienced workers&lt;/a&gt;. They are likely to be left behind and remain in a jobless limbo long after the economy has picked up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/were-replicating-mistakes-2008/609586/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Jesse Eisinger: We’re replicating the mistakes of 2008&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Meanwhile, the old stigmas against unemployed workers will resurface, as memories of the initial crisis fade and people &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/10/extreme-meritocracy/505358/?utm_source=feed"&gt;find new reasons to fault&lt;/a&gt; others for not pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. Even today, we see hints of what is to come. Some of the country’s most prominent conservative ideologues are already &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/489665-hannity-challenges-mnuchin-on-coronavirus-bill-expanding-unemployment-benefits"&gt;complaining about&lt;/a&gt; how Congress’s top-up of unemployment benefits encourages people to drop out of the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This resentment will become much more widespread and pernicious. Here, again, history is instructive. Even during the Great Depression, a global economic catastrophe that catapulted the U.S. unemployment rate to &lt;a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.7.2.41"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1948/article/pdf/labor-force-employment-and-unemployment-1929-39-estimating-methods.pdf"&gt;25 percent&lt;/a&gt;, resentment grew as the doldrums persisted. As the sociologists Katherine Newman and Elisabeth Jacobs &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Who_Cares/kqsXENFHzkQC?hl=en"&gt;have noted&lt;/a&gt;, critics of the Roosevelt administration excoriated the long-term unemployed as malingerers and reprobates and assailed New Deal programs as socialist schemes to tax the middle class into poverty. Eight decades later, a Wall Street–led financial contagion pushed the unemployment rate to 10 percent. This time, the &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Strangers_in_Their_Own_Land.html?id=86v0CwAAQBAJ"&gt;rancor coalesced&lt;/a&gt; more quickly, fed by a steady drumbeat of rage from cable news, talk radio, and, eventually, the Tea Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During the second phase of the coronavirus recession, America’s temporarily strengthened social safety net will revert to its &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/forget-denmark-emulate-canada/410947/?utm_source=feed"&gt;usual bare-bones form&lt;/a&gt;. Somehow, no money will be available to help the long-term unemployed—even though, just three years ago, Congress found more than enough to pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefited the wealthiest Americans. As their unemployment benefits expire, the jobless and their families will face financial collapse. Public outpourings of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/spiritual-crisis-modern-economy/511067/?utm_source=feed"&gt;compassion and grace&lt;/a&gt; will be steadily replaced, as they were in past downturns, with moralizing anger pumped up by partisan media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Swift action from Congress could prevent the coming disaster. First, lawmakers would need to make permanent the temporary upgrades that Congress made to our &lt;a href="https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2016/04/26/the-pain-behind-the-pennsylvania-primary/ideas/nexus/"&gt;antiquated unemployment-insurance system&lt;/a&gt;, which raised benefits so that families don’t sink rapidly into poverty and extended those benefits to gig workers. But beyond helping the unemployed, Congress must also revamp our regulatory system and safety net to better shield our growing workforce of &lt;a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/adulting-while-poor-millenial-homeownership"&gt;underemployed workers&lt;/a&gt;—not just &lt;a href="https://inthefray.org/2016/08/a-minimum-of-dignity-fight-for-15-minimum-wage/"&gt;low-wage workers&lt;/a&gt;, but also the broader group of freelancers, temps, and &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Fissured_Workplace.html?id=k4_zAgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;source=kp_book_description"&gt;subcontractors&lt;/a&gt; who have few legal protections and tend to be the first to go when the economy sputters. &lt;a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/meritocracys-casualties"&gt;Severe income inequality&lt;/a&gt; means that even employed Americans often live paycheck to paycheck, with no savings to get them through the next emergency. A just-in-time economy, it turns out, has no real margin for error. Tying health insurance to employment is unusually harmful to workers amid a health crisis that provokes mass joblessness while requiring widespread virus testing and intensive care. If the threats posed by longer-term trends like automation were not reason enough, the present unemployment shock has enhanced the appeal of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/08/marriage-rates-education/536913/?utm_source=feed"&gt;benefits not linked to work&lt;/a&gt;—including a universal basic income.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/millennials-are-new-lost-generation/609832/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Annie Lowrey: Millennials don’t stand a chance&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Policies that provide only temporary relief are insufficient to protect American workers from all the forces arrayed against them.

When the airliner was shot down near Tehran, tensions were high. Iran had struck an American base in response to the U.S. killing of the Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani. Nervous Iranian anti-aircraft crews expected retaliation, and the gunner in question likely thought he was shooting down a military target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The incident marked the fourth time a radar-guided SAM destroyed a civilian airliner by mistake. Such accidents have already killed 842 people, and as SAMs proliferate, further tragedies may be in store. These so-called smart weapons aren’t smart enough. But with some relatively straightforward changes, the fourth accidental shoot-down of a passenger jet could also be the last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Almost all civilian aircraft have transponders that broadcast a signal showing altitude and speed. Just the fact that an object in the sky is reporting such information almost always means that the object is civilian, since attack aircraft and incoming ordinance do not announce themselves electronically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/iran-shot-down-hopes-its-people/605158/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Suzanne Maloney: Iran’s Leaders Have a Problem They Can’t Fix&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Most airliners also send a message called Mode C, which is digital-speak for “I am civilian.” On top of that, new transponders broadcast substantial detail about the flight—a rich data stream called ADS-B—that no attacker would volunteer. As of 2020, American airliners must have ADS-B, while most other nations are in the process of requiring this addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Too many contemporary precision missiles are smart only in the sense of finding a target. The targeting technology of beyond-visual-range SAMs, such as the U.S. Patriot or the Russian Tor used by Iran, has gotten notably better in the past few decades. That is, if better is the word for longer range and near-perfect accuracy to destroy anything hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yet these technological advancements don’t mean that long-range SAMs have details about what they are targeting. The screens used by the missile operators may not show civilian identification signals. When a target is too far away to view, the gunner may see only a radar reflection—a target blip. Is this a planeload of tourists? The first wave of a surprise attack? The gunner may have to guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If SAM systems were designed—or for those already in use, retrofitted—to receive and identify civilian Mode C and ADS-B signals, gunners would be able to distinguish between civilian and military planes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The screens in front of missile operators could clearly identify civilian aircraft and warn against firing at them, and missile launch mechanisms could require authentication codes before accepting a civilian blip as a target. Some of these advancements are available, just not widely in use yet. The Polish arms manufacturer Mesko, for example, is already working on a SAM that requires an authentication code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Improving the ability of missile gunners to understand what the target is would not eliminate deliberate atrocity, but the innovation would go a long way in preventing mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap" dir="ltr"&gt;In 1988, a U.S. Navy cruiser in the Persian Gulf called the Vincennes shot a long-range SAM at Iran Air Flight 655, a scheduled passenger flight. U.S. and Iranian warships had recently been firing at each other. &lt;a href="https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/about-us/leadership/director/directors-corner/h-grams/h-gram-020/h-020-1-uss-vincennes-tragedy--.html"&gt;Investigators found&lt;/a&gt; that personnel in the ship’s windowless combat information center (CIC) had confused radar reflections from the jetliner, an Airbus, with signals from an Iranian military aircraft that was not approaching but was in the same general direction as the passenger flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Displays in 1988 did not show the tactical officers the difference between blips representing civilian aircraft and those representing threats. This became the first accident involving a modern long-range SAM. Two-hundred and ninety people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Recently, I was on the USS Wasp, a huge American warship. The CIC looked like any other: a windowless, boxy room with a mess of screens, buttons, and joysticks in low ambient light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Electronics on the Wasp and other Navy vessels can now distinguish between civilian and military aerial targets. That is, the ships already have what an international convention might require of all long-range radar-guided missiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There was a lot of soul-searching after the Vincennes incident, a lot of determination this won’t happen again,” says Greg Baker, the captain of the Wasp. The Vincennes killed civilians by mistake; since then, the Navy’s sensor systems have been significantly improved. For example, screens now make civilian aircraft appear visually different from possible hostiles, the innovation that all gunners should have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/01/what-iranian-way-war-looks-like/604438/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The Blueprint Iran Could Follow After Soleimani’s Death&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Other military divisions are also making these technological improvements. In February, the Pentagon began installing the Patriot SAM, operated by the Army, in Iraq. William Sharp, a spokesperson for the Army, told me that the ability to display the Mode C “I am a civilian” transponder signal has been added to Patriot batteries. The missiles’ fire-director software is programmed to “interrogate” any target by sending pings that ask friendly military aircraft to respond with an identification code, while requesting civilian aircraft to respond on Mode C. If the latter happens, the Patriot system marks the radar reflection as civilian. Various protocols make it unlikely, though not impossible, that an attacker could trick the Patriot, or Navy SAMs, into thinking it was civilian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap" dir="ltr"&gt;This new technology goes a long way in preventing mistakes, but cooperation at a higher level is needed. Governments should collaborate on an international initiative to require that radar-guided SAMs, and the similar class of anti-ship missiles, incorporate improved technology for sensing and recognizing civilian signals. Any convention should also include non-technological guidelines, such as notices to pilots who are in a war zone, that would help prevent accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One possible model for a pact is the1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which regulates the use of land mines and blinding lasers, among other threats to noncombatants. The agreement is not ironclad. Donald Trump recently&lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2071692/landmine-policy/"&gt; said the United States would&lt;/a&gt; no longer abide by certain restrictions on land mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Nevertheless, the convention is considered a success, as land mines have declined since most nations declared they would renounce such weapons.&lt;a href="http://the-monitor.org/en-gb/home.aspx"&gt; Forty-one of the 50 nations&lt;/a&gt; that a generation ago manufactured land mines have stopped producing them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;More informal diplomacy concerning conventional weapons has also been successful and provides a way forward for international cooperation on SAM technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 2002, terrorists near an airport in Mombasa, Kenya, tried to use shoulder-fired rockets called MANPADS to shoot down a civilian airliner. These weapons are easy to hide and relatively inexpensive. “There was a clear sense the situation was out of control and that no nation would benefit, only terrorists,” Matthew Schroeder, a senior researcher for Small Arms Survey, which tracks battlefield armaments, says of MANPADS. So organizations came up with regional agreements “unprecedented in specificity and scope.” Schroeder believes that these pacts reduced the problem considerably. For instance, Russia no longer markets the easily hidden bazooka-style rocket, offering only a mounted version that cannot be removed from a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Because the MANPADS agreements are regional compacts administered by little-known organizations such as the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, the conventions on these small anti-aircraft rockets failed to draw attention. Yet a&lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR4300/RR4304/RAND_RR4304.pdf"&gt; 2019 Rand Corporation study&lt;/a&gt; found that since about 2000, attempts to hit airliners with small heat-seeking weapons have declined dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/trump-is-no-closer-to-solving-americas-iran-problem/604630/?utm_source=feed"&gt;David Graham: Trump Is No Closer to Solving America’s Iran Problem&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These agreements involving land mines and small rockets show that international conventions actually can produce positive results. Because long-range radar-guided missiles are made only by large professional militaries, the United States, Russia, and China would need to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There would be a lot of pushback against an agreement that allowed inspectors to look at the details of American, Russian, or Chinese weapons-sensor technology,” cautions Steven Pifer of Stanford, a former State Department arms-control specialist. But even if an agreement were strictly declaratory, reform momentum would be created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap" dir="ltr"&gt;The details of the tragedy in Iran earlier this year show that the accident could have been avoided if technological and diplomatic agreements had been in place. A notice to airmen was not issued; this would have closed airspace around Tehran to civilian planes. Pilots of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 took off unaware that Iran expected an air battle. Screens watched by Iranian gunners did not show that the passenger flight was announcing altitude and speed on a civilian frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A campaign to make anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles less dangerous would not seek to ban such weapons. Rather, it would accept that nations arm for war, and ask only that armaments become less likely to take life by mistake. Winston Churchill once commented on the problem of military weapons killing civilians: “Are we beasts?” Let’s prove that we are not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gregg Easterbrook</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/gregg-easterbrook/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/RTS2NE1V/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Smart Weapons Need to Be Smarter</title><published>2020-04-19T06:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-19T12:18:12-04:00</updated><summary type="html">No missiles should shoot down civilian airliners by mistake.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/smart-weapons-need-be-smarter/609472/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2020:50-610204</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Around the country, Jewish communities have all but shut down, closing synagogues, canceling Passover seders, conducting funerals by Zoom. Yet one kind of Jewish public space has remained mostly open: mikvahs, or pools used for ritual immersions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each month, when they get their period, some Jewish women observe a time of &lt;em&gt;niddah&lt;/em&gt;, or ritual impurity. As long as they’re bleeding, and often for at least a week afterward, they can’t have sex with their partner. Many couples won’t hug or kiss, sleep in the same bed, or even pass objects to each other. Under any circumstances, this can be challenging to maintain. Imagine what it’s like under quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to exit this state of &lt;em&gt;niddah&lt;/em&gt;, women must visit the mikvah, usually a small, humid, windowless room where another woman watches them dip, naked, into a pool of water that maybe a dozen other women have already used. For many who observe the laws of &lt;em&gt;niddah&lt;/em&gt;, the prospect of immersing during the COVID-19 outbreak is terrifying: Many mikvahs are highly trafficked spaces that involve extensive bodily exposure. But the alternatives may seem equally untenable: remaining separate from their partner indefinitely, or violating a central commandment of the Torah. For these women, the quarantine has set up an impossible choice between protecting their health and upholding their faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/?utm_source=feed"&gt;[Read: Our pandemic summer]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of days before Passover, Aimee Baron, a mother of five, steeled her nerves and decided to visit the mikvah in her neighborhood in the Bronx. Her family has been leaving the apartment only once a week since the outbreak began; getting her kids, including her 6-year-old twins, through the hallways and lobby without touching anything can be a daunting task. Normally, the mikvah would provide everything she needed to prepare for her immersion—a bath where she could soak before, floss for cleaning her teeth, a comb to untangle her hair. This time, though, she brought her own bag and towel. Her immersion would be quick, but even that was anxiety-producing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every time any of us go outside, we’re all just petrified about touching, petrified about breathing,” she told me. At the mikvah, “there are a thousand surfaces that I have to put my things down on that could have been contaminated.” Like many other mikvahs, the facility in Riverdale has been screening women for symptoms, sanitizing its rooms between uses, and strictly limiting the number of people who can be in the building at the same time. But when the mikvah is the one public space a woman has visited in several weeks, it’s hard not to be wary. Like other Jewish communities, the large population in Riverdale has been hit hard by the outbreak: Some of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/new-york-coronavirus-westchester/2020/03/04/a9e0c5e0-5e48-11ea-b014-4fafa866bb81_story.html"&gt;the first cases of the virus&lt;/a&gt; in New York involved SAR Academy, an Orthodox day school in the area. “We know many, many, many, many, many people who have been sick, who have been on ventilators,” Baron told me. “And we’re praying for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2013/10/jewish-american-full-report-for-web.pdf"&gt;2013 Pew Research Center study&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 10 percent of American Jews are Orthodox—roughly half a million people. Although Orthodox women are by far the most common mikvah users, the pools are also used for Jewish conversions, life-cycle events such as weddings, and men’s immersions before prayer. By and large, these other uses have been put on indefinite hold. “There are a lot of fixtures of Jewish life that Jews can actually live without,” Rivkah Slonim, a Hasidic woman who has written and lectured extensively about mikvah use, told me. “We can be without synagogues. We can be without a Torah scroll. We cannot, in Jewish law, move forward as a community … without a mikvah.” Immersion is a commandment that comes directly from the Torah, and the punishment for violating it—being cut off from God—is severe. That’s why many communities have kept their mikvahs open even when everything else is closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Jewish leaders believe mikvah immersion is safe. Lila Kagedan, a rabbi who works as a bioethicist at several hospitals and universities in New York and Boston, has spent recent weeks advising rabbis and mikvah directors around the country about how to handle the coronavirus crisis. She constantly monitors the latest guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local governments. Mikvahs are not distinctively risky spaces, she told me. She pointed out that many more people go through a grocery store on a typical day than through a mikvah where women are spacing out their immersions, and mikvah attendants aggressively wipe down surfaces and treat the water with sanitizing chemicals. Even so, scientists &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-airborne-go-outside-masks/609235/?utm_source=feed"&gt;are still determining&lt;/a&gt; how the coronavirus travels through the air and how much danger is involved in different activities. And people who appear to be healthy can infect others, according to the CDC. “I can’t say that there’s no risk,” Kagedan said. “There is risk when we go for a walk around the block.” Ariel Sadwin, a regional government-affairs liaison for Agudath Israel of America, a large umbrella organization of Orthodox Jewish communities, has not heard of state governments threatening to shut down mikvahs, he told me, but many rabbis are fearful that this could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mikvahs have found the risks of immersion to be intolerable. Mayyim Hayyim, a pluralist, egalitarian mikvah in Boston, decided in late March to close for the duration of the pandemic. “The board ended up being really split over what to do,” Carrie Bornstein, the executive director, told me. “There was just a really strong feeling, ultimately: If even one person could have the risk of being exposed because of coming to Mayyim Hayyim, we just don’t want to take that risk.” Because Mayyim Hayyim serves a more liberal Jewish population than the typical mikvah, not all of its users abide by the same rules restricting their sex lives as women who observe &lt;em&gt;niddah&lt;/em&gt;. But for all of them, the closure is a burden. A prospective Jewish convert may be disappointed to delay a long-awaited conversion ceremony; a bride might mourn her carefully planned pre-wedding immersion. And queer couples who used Mayyim Hayyim’s mikvah to observe the laws of &lt;em&gt;niddah&lt;/em&gt; now face a challenge of their own: finding a facility in the mostly Orthodox-run network of mikvahs where they feel comfortable immersing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/orthodox-judaism-millennials/476118/?utm_source=feed"&gt;[Read: Why Orthodox Judaism is appealing to so many Millennials]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mikvah dilemma is especially excruciating for women who are trying to get pregnant. If they don’t immerse after their period, they can’t have sex, meaning that they may have to delay conceiving. For most women who observe &lt;em&gt;niddah&lt;/em&gt;, skipping immersion and having sex anyway is likely out of the question: “It would be like eating pig,” Bat Sheva Marcus, an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/magazine/the-orthodox-sex-guru.html"&gt;Orthodox Jewish sex therapist&lt;/a&gt;, told me. Since the pandemic started, social media has been flooded with women debating what to do about immersion. “It’s wrenching,” Marcus said. “Do something that you feel religiously not okay with, or do something that makes you feel unsafe? Neither of those are good options. They’re terrible options.” The pandemic has already created immense challenges for women struggling with infertility: In mid-March, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/parenting/fertility-coronavirus.html"&gt;issued new guidelines&lt;/a&gt; advising doctors to suspend new IVF cycles and cancel elective surgeries and embryo transfers. For women who want to be pregnant, the mikvah can be another reminder that they are not. “My community is in a tremendous amount of pain,” said Baron, the Riverdale mom, who leads an online community for women dealing with fertility issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secular news outlets have &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/hasidic-jews-hold-another-funeral-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/"&gt;widely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/nyregion/coronavirus-hasidic-weddings-brooklyn.html"&gt;condemned&lt;/a&gt; people in New York’s and New Jersey’s Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods who have refused to comply with stay-at-home orders, gathering by the hundreds for funerals and weddings against strong government advice. Simcha Eichenstein, the New York State assemblyman who represents the densely populated Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods of Borough Park and Midwood in Brooklyn, told me that the majority of residents are adhering to New York City guidelines, and many large families are isolating in small apartments to stay safe. Women who otherwise don’t go out at all are still venturing to mikvahs, though. The Crown Heights Mikvah in Brooklyn is seeing 20 to 25 women each night, which is when women typically immerse, said Leah Yechielov, an attendant there. This is a significant reduction in the average traffic to their three pools, but still means that roughly 150 women are going in and out of the facility each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/stockpile-food-my-garage/608290/?utm_source=feed"&gt;[Read: The stockpile of food in my garage]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channie Rappaport, who runs a small mikvah associated with Congregation Zichron Rabbeinu Moshe Feinstein in the suburban-Brooklyn neighborhood of Mill Basin, said that her small facility typically opens only on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, and her husband, the congregation’s rabbi, treats and changes the water himself. But the pandemic has brought them more business than usual: They’ve opened up for daily immersions so that local women don’t have to drive to bigger mikvahs 15 or 20 minutes away. “There’s a tremendous amount of anxiety,” she said. She’s gotten panicked calls from women whose children have health issues, women who have asthma, and women caring for family members who have had cancer. Although people outside of the Orthodox community might say that these women should just stay home, going to the mikvah is not optional in the way that praying together in synagogue or attending family gatherings is, according to Ruth Balinsky Friedman, a clergywoman at Ohev Shalom, an Orthodox synagogue in Washington, D.C. “I very much understand the impulse to see religion as more symbolic—something that we do when we’re able to, but in a time of crisis, we put aside,” she told me. But “you can’t cancel” the commandments governing sex, she said. “That’s the word of God.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are strange times for most families. Spouses have been forced to sleep in separate bedrooms when one of them falls ill. People are sensitized to every touch and aware of every object that might have been handled by someone else. Across America, quarantined families are experiencing the intimacy of distance, finding ways to convey love even when they can’t touch or share space with one another. For now, everyone, including the women who observe &lt;em&gt;niddah&lt;/em&gt;, remains suspended in this in-between space, with no clear answer on how to escape from isolation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Emma Green</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/emma-green/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2020/04/h_14375578/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Damon Winter / The New York Times / Redux</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Orthodox Jewish Women Are Facing an Impossible Choice Right Now</title><published>2020-04-19T05:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-19T11:58:32-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Women who observe the Jewish laws of sexual purity have to immerse in a ritual pool after their period.
