    <p>The theme in this “Our Towns” space has been, and remains, the sources of vitality, practicality, generosity, and renewal in local-level America, despite bitter polarization in national-level politics.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/city-makers-american-futures/">series began</a> almost seven years ago, when smaller communities across the United States were still trying to rebuild their economies after the financial collapse of 2008 and beyond.</p><p>Now, with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the very people and groups that led the way in local recovery—small businesses, innovative start-up organizations, locally oriented restaurants and bookshops and bars and civic spaces—are exposed to a sharper, more sudden, and potentially more devastating shock than the one they endured a dozen years ago.</p><p>National-level and international responses obviously will determine much of our collective public-health and economic future. But in the past two weeks, Americans have already seen governors and mayors, schools and hospitals, religious organizations and foundations and nonprofit groups taking the lead while the national government has faltered.</p><p>The upcoming theme in this space will be on-the-ground reports on the way the economic, civic, and medical dramas are playing out. Part of America’s future is being determined right now in the U.S. Senate, at the Centers for Disease Control, and in the White House. But what is happening in the rest of the country matters at least as much, and probably more.</p><p>Let me start with a reader’s note that directly addresses this point, and then a few resources from people who have been thinking about equalizing opportunity around the country, before the current cataclysm. The reader’s note is below.</p>

        <p>An <em>Atlantic</em> reader who has moved from a major East Coast city to a medium-sized city in Greater Appalachia writes:</p><blockquote>
<p>My apologies if this seems irrelevant given the size and scope of the current world situation. Given your past works, I thought this might provide some fodder for your overarching work regarding <em>Our Towns</em>.</p>

<p>I am a lifelong politics and government person in my mid-40s. I spent the better part of 15 years engaged in either civic associations, county-level citizen advisory groups, and local government advocacy. I experienced first hand how listening to a community's concerns, and working directly with local officials, could make a material difference in a neighborhood’s quality of life.    </p>

<p>Against this backdrop, I avidly followed your dispatches from around the country during the research for <em>Our Towns</em>. As I was still an active private pilot at the time, it was a perfect mix of topics for me.</p>

<p>It also planted in me the idea that there were different ways of achieving a quality of life outside of the major metropolitan areas. It was a major reason my wife and I started to look outside of [an East Coast metropolis] for where our next chapter could take place.</p>

<p>We settled on [the medium-sized city], moving here in December of 2019. It was like your main thesis come to life. Besides the unlimited outdoor options, the easier pace of life, the strong local brewery scene, there is a palpable sense of local patriotism. Of locals seeing their success being tied to one another.  </p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>And so it is heartbreaking to see and feel the very hard limitations of this optimistic world view run headlong into the current [coronavirus] situation.</p>

<p>I am saddened for lives that will be lost and economic hardship that we will endure. This is mixed with a nearly overwhelming anger … Even admitting that a President isn’t responsible for creating the underlying crisis of a pandemic(or oil market crash), they are responsible for having systems and institutions that have been nourished and prepared to react to them.</p>

<p>I know that over a long enough time period, we'll recover and we will rebuild. But there will always be scar tissue. And part of that is a honest reckoning of how fragile the system is, and a dimming of optimism for what it can build. A small price compared to loss of a loved one, or the economic pain that will sure to be revisited upon our most vulnerable population.</p>

(James Fallows / The Atlantic)</figcaption></figure><p>Many groups and individuals we’ve reported on, over these past half-dozen years, are gearing up now to deal with the economic crises that are affecting everyone, in places large and small, but <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/11/democrats-should-discuss-dislocation/602149/">that could intensify</a> existing regional differences.</p><p>Some of the reports and insights we have been following, and will report on, in coming days:</p><p>1) “<strong>A Vital Midwest: The Path to a New Prosperity</strong>,” from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Information about the report, by John Austin and Alexander Hitch, <a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/vital-midwest-path-new-prosperity">is here</a>. The full report, in PDF, <a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/sites/default/files/ccga_vital_midwest_fullissue_final_0.pdf">is here</a>.</p><p>As the introduction by <a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/expert/richard-c-longworth">Richard C. Longworth</a> of the Council, previously a long-time economics writer for the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, puts it, the stereotype of the industrial Midwest that dominates political discussion is out of touch with real developments there:</p><blockquote>
<p>Much of the world’s attention to the Midwest is an almost indecent fascination, born of the 2016 presidential election, with the postindustrial rust and ruin of the region’s old factory towns and rural hinterlands. With the nation’s gaze thus averted, the rest of the Midwest has been reinventing itself. The result, half completed, looks nothing like the silos and smokestacks of yore ….<br><br>
Already we see a new Midwest, powered by different places, people, and industries … Most of the economic capitals of this new Midwest are not the old industrial cities. The new economic centers are places like Columbus, Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; Indianapolis, Indiana; Madison, Wisconsin; and Minneapolis, Minnesota….  All have leaders who understand that the world has changed and their cities must change with it. And all know where they stand on the global supply chain. They are global cities now, earning their living from the global economy.</p>
</blockquote><p>The report is worth reading in full, for midwesterners and anyone else considering the next stage in American economic recovery.</p><hr class="c-section-divider"><p><br>
2) “<strong>Countering America’s regional economic disparities is going to take more than hope,</strong>” from Mark Muro and Robert Atkinson, via AEI. Information about the report <a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/countering-americas-regional-economic-disparities-is-going-to-take-more-than-hope/">is here</a>, and the full PDF <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Countering-America%E2%80%99s-Regional-Economic-Disparities-Is-Going-to-Take-More-Than-Hope.pdf">is here</a>. This follows a longer and more detailed report, “The case for growth centers: How to spread tech innovation across America,” by the same two authors and Jacob Whiton, which came out late last year as a joint project by Brookings and the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. (Summary of Brookings-ITIF paper <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/growth-centers-how-to-spread-tech-innovation-across-america/">here</a>; PDF <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Full-Report-Growth-Centers_PDF_BrookingsMetro-BassCenter-ITIF.pdf">here</a>.)<br><br>
The reports’ main argument is that despite the mounting costs and frictions of operating in super-star cities like San Francisco and Seattle, and despite the growth of “<a href="https://www.revolution.com/entity/rotr/">Rise of the Rest</a>” centers across the country (a trend they dispute), the highest-value parts of the tech economy are still concentrating themselves in a handful of places. Left to its own incentives, the authors argue, the tech economy will <em>not</em> naturally spread itself more broadly across the country.<br><br>
But, they say, it can be nudged, encouraged, and steered in that direction. To me the fascinating part of these analyses is their specificity about exactly where innovation-promoting policies might be effective—and their reminder that today’s richest regional economies themselves are success stories of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/11/democrats-should-discuss-dislocation/602149/">place-conscious policies</a> of the past.</p><p>As for past examples, the Brookings-ITIF report says:</p><blockquote>
<p>From the 1920s to the 1940s, many believed that Boston would go the way of the rest of New England, with the city’s traditional manufacturing of textiles, shoes, and machines migrating to the low-cost South and stagnation setting in. But Boston took a different path toward becoming one the strongest innovation hubs in the world, in no small part due to federal support. World War II brought an influx of federal funding to the city, especially for the development of military electronics. As the Cold War began, that support was formalized and dramatically expanded ...</p>

<p>The federal government was even more instrumental in the development of Silicon Valley …. In 1992, Santa Clara County (the heart of Silicon Valley) received more defense prime contract funding per capita than any county in the nation. As historian Leslie Berlin writes: “It’s not a stretch at all to say that Silicon Valley exists because of the federal government.”</p>

<p>The federal government also had a major hand in the development of North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park ….</p>

<p>None of this is to say that these federal investments created these places on their own or that they were designed to create these places … But they did help enable emerging growth centers to become self-sustaining.</p>
</blockquote><p>As for current candidates, the report gives this map. The report gives details about these localities:</p><figure style="max-width: 672.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:78.869047619%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/03/InnovationMap/59e24a07e.png" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">Courtesy of Brookings and ITIF</figcaption></figure><p>This past week, Muro, Whiton, and Robert Maxim, of Brookings, did a report on the metro areas where the pandemic shutdown <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/03/17/the-places-a-covid-19-recession-will-likely-hit-hardest/">was likely to be most destructive</a>. For instance, this is part of their list of places where economies are most dependent on “high risk” industries like energy and tourism, and so where job losses could be worst:</p><figure style="max-width: 625.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:40.16%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2020/03/Brookings/6b35a5def.png" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">Brookings analysis of data from Emsi</figcaption></figure><p>For now the main point is: In the long, slow, uneven recovery from the past Great Recession, people around the country have thought and learned a lot about the process of recovery, and how it can be hastened and more broadly shared. We’ll try to share some of those findings in this space, and report on local responses to this new global crisis.</p><hr class="c-section-divider"><p>3) “<strong>How to Rescue Main Street From Coronavirus Before It’s Too Late</strong>,” by Adam Ozimek and John Lettieri for the Economic Innovation Group. (Report <a href="https://eig.org/news/main-street-rescue-and-resiliency-program">is here</a>; PDF version is <a href="https://eig.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Main-Street-Rescue-and-Resiliency-Program_031820pdf.pdf">here</a>.)</p><p>The title is self-explanatory, and the meat of this report is a detailed list of proposals for sustaining the small businesses that have been so crucial in community renewal around the country, and now are at unprecedented risk.</p><p>Thanks to these authors, innovators, and other civic patriots. More reports on their work in the days to come.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ourtowns">More from this series</a></p></div>

    <div class="content " itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>From an author’s point of view, the most important quality of any book is its <em>done</em>-ness. Once you accept that a book is as good as it is going to be, and as finished as you can stand to make it, the miasma lifts and you can move on—to the next writing project!</p><p>From a reader’s point of view, the most important qualities of a certain kind of non-fiction book are brevity, specificity, and humor. I’m talking about “theme”or “argument” books that address a current issue—as opposed to, say, biographies, which can be at their best when long and meandering, or narratives or histories, which are designed to immerse you in the details of another time and place.</p><p>When the purpose of a book is to advance a new or different way of thinking about a topic, it should be: as short as possible (so the reader gets the point efficiently); as specific as possible (so the reader can test the argument, and perhaps change future ideas or behavior); and as droll as possible (because, obviously).</p><p><a href="https://www.counterpointpress.com/dd-product/american-manifesto/"><em>American Manifesto: Saving Democracy from Villains, Vandals, and Ourselves</em></a>, a new book by Bob Garfield, passes these tests. It is short, specific, and droll. It is very much worth reading, for ideas about the next stage in the world’s recovery from failed, weak, and in other ways troubled media systems.</p><hr class="c-section-divider"><p>Garfield is known to most of the world as co-host, with Brooke Gladstone, of the public radio show <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/otm-about/"><em>On the Media</em></a>, from WNYC in New York. I’ve known him in that way, from listening to the show regularly and being an occasional guest on it. But I’ve also followed Garfield’s work through the years on the topic of this book—actual programs and systems to improve the media, both financially and substantively. In <em>American Manifesto</em> he pulls together many of the themes he has developed. The result is something that’s neither, on one extreme, a detailed, step-by-step “white paper”-style report on media improvement—nor, on the other, just an op-ed-scale lament.</p><p>Instead it’s part diagnosis, part prescription. As he puts it in the early pages, in a passage that gives an idea of his writing tone:</p><blockquote>
<p>This book is a cry for help in three parts. The dry way of describing it: “An examination of the tragic confluence of the American preoccupation with identity and the catastrophic disintegration of mass media, yielding a society that may be irretrievably fractured, unless we act now.” A less dry way of putting it: “Run for your life. We’re being Dumptied.” As in Humpty, the self-satisfied jumbo egg that once sat atop a big, beautiful wall and wound up in countless irreparable pieces.</p>

<p>Take note: I am not speaking of Trumpty Dumpty. The greatest threat we face is not from a rogue president, but from ourselves.</p>
</blockquote><p>The three parts that follow are about, first, social and political division; and second, the collapsing economics of traditional media. (“Media have been ‘disrupted’ like the <em>Hindenburg</em> was ‘disrupted.’ A three-century-old mass-media model has been blown to smithereens, and the surviving journalistic fragments are not only too poor to adequately watchdog the government, but also algorithmically segregated from huge swaths of the electorate. O, the humanity.”) The concluding third section is a six-point action plan for individual, corporate, and political remedies.</p><p>For most people who have followed the future-of-media debate, the book’s greatest value will be in part three, the recommendations. I won’t give away all of Bob Garfield’s action plan. But I will say that one of its main public-policy proposals involves modernizing antitrust laws and enforcement, to catch up with the technological, financial, and social realities of this age.</p><p>The title of that chapter is “No, Really, Trust Busting.” The term “trust-busting” comes of course from the original Gilded Age era, when new and maturing technologies (railroads, automobiles, mass production, mass communication, industrialized agriculture) created new fortunes and new inequalities. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the Teddy Roosevelt trust-busting efforts of the early 1900s, the rise of the labor movement, the state-by-state spread of reform laws—these were all responses. For democracy and civil society to survive after our Second Gilded Age, something comparable is necessary now. So Bob Garfield argues, and so I agree.</p><p>(By the way, one of the best political speeches I’ve heard on this topic was by a U.S. senator, back in 2016. You can read about the event where the senator spoke, which I happen to have attended, <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/open-markets/events/americas-monopoly-problem/">here</a>, and get a <a href="http://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2016-6-29_Warren_Antitrust_Speech.pdf">PDF of the speech text here</a>. Spoiler: The senator was Elizabeth Warren, and the speech was given long before she launched her presidential run. The event was titled “America’s Monopoly Problem: What Should the Next President Do About It?” It took place when most of the political world assumed that the “Next President” in question would be Hillary Clinton, because of her then-enormous lead over Donald Trump in the polls.)</p><p>I was glad to have read <em>American Manifesto</em>, and I think most media- or politics-minded people will be too. Congratulations to Bob Garfield on its done-ness, and good news for the rest of us in its brevity, specificity, and wit.</p>

The town is in the process of building the first Museum of Redlands, populated largely from the outgrown archives of the library, and which the library will oversee. The library already oversees the Lincoln Shrine, an entire building of a nationally-renowned collection of Lincolniana, just across the lawn from the Smiley library.   </p>

    <p>Since Jim Fallows and I began traveling the country for <a href="https://americanfutures.org/">American Futures</a> and <a href="https://www.ourtownsbook.com/">Our Towns</a> nearly seven years ago, there has been one beat that began as a surprise to me and grew into the most heartening story I’ve witnessed of American resilience. That is the story of public libraries and how they have responded to the challenges facing American towns.</p><p>If you haven’t been in a public library lately, you probably wouldn’t recognize where you were if you entered one tomorrow. This is no longer, as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/10/not-your-mothers-library/381119/">I wrote</a> early on, your mother’s library. The books are still there; the readers are still there; the librarians are still there. But sharing the same space are children busy with all kinds of active—and sometimes noisy—programs, inventors in maker-spaces, historians and amateurs researching genealogy, job-seekers scouring the internet, homeless people settling in quietly for the day, women and a few men heading to the yoga space, others watching movies, young entrepreneurs grabbing lattes, people considering the art exhibits, librarians helping others research a medical issue or housing issue or how to earn a GED, tutors helping school kids with math, people checking out hiking backpacks, fishing poles, wireless hotspots, snow shovels, and seeds for vegetable gardens.</p><p>And in their offices are the librarians and staff figuring out how to fill all these wants and needs of their communities and to anticipate what can possibly be coming to their town next, like a hurricane or, God forbid, a shooting. I saw many backroom views of libraries, from the depths of their groaning archives to their automated transport and delivery systems of books among libraries. I also ran into many pop-up versions of libraries in odd places from front yards to public parks to the middle of a lake.</p><hr class="c-section-divider"><p>After telling so many of their stories one by one, I wanted to show you what some of the libraries look like. These are my amateur photos of some of the libraries I’ve seen around the U.S., and even a few others I’ve visited around the world.</p><p>The libraries were in cities as small as Eastport, Maine, population 1,300, and as big as Columbus, Ohio, population 890,000. Most cities were in between in size, largely ranging from 10,000 to 65,000.  I also visited public libraries in Shanghai, population 24 million, and across Australia.</p><p>Here are some images that stay in my mind about libraries. This first of two collections features the children’s areas and the adult spaces. Coming up next will be what’s in the library beyond books, and alternative public libraries.</p><p>The first photo here is inside the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/08/peavey-library-eastport-draft/596848/">Peavey Memorial Library</a> in Eastport, Maine.</p><figure style="max-width: 672.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:75.0%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/12/IMG_20190814_121351_1/a2a2d33f4.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">The children’s area of Eastport Maine’s Peavey Memorial Library</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Children’s rooms</strong>: Whenever I asked directors or librarians about the most important efforts in their libraries, or their top dreams and aspirations yet to come, they invariably answered some version of: “It’s the children; it’s all about the children.” And they homed in on reading readiness or school readiness or child development, particularly for the kids who need it most. Attracting children, and their parents, into libraries is a prime mission.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/08/public-library-and-people/595480/">Brownsville, Texas, </a>built a wonderland of a children’s room and have newly gone all out into the ultra-modern space for teenagers.</p><figure style="max-width: 672.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:75.0%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/12/IMG_20190618_114432/43677c522.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">The children’s space in the Brownsville Public Library</figcaption></figure><p></p><figure style="max-width: 672.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:75.0%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/12/IMG_20190618_113919/3ac8faea3.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">The Space14s (get it?) in the Brownsville Public Library</figcaption></figure><p>A former Walmart has been transformed into the new and spacious McAllen Texas public library:</p><figure style="max-width: 672.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:75.0%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/12/IMG_20190618_194127_1_1/ad67e3d02.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">The children’s space in the McAllen public library</figcaption></figure><p>In my hometown of Vermilion, Ohio, on the shore of Lake Erie, the children’s area is built on the nautical themes familiar to the kids who grow up there.

    <div class="content " itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Here are news items and developments related to trends we’ve been covering in the recent “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/our-towns/">Our Towns</a>” series, and elsewhere:</p><ol type="1"><li><em>The furniture business returns, and is looking for furniture-makers</em>. In <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/06/the-reinvention-of-danvilles-downtown-part-i/591325/">a series of dispatches from Danville, Virginia</a>, and its environs, Deb Fallows and I talked about this region’s reaction after the three previous pillars of its manufacturing economy collapsed more or less at the same time, over the past generation.<br><br>
	Those pillars were tobacco-growing and related activities, which for obvious public-health reasons have been <a href="http://www.ncglobaleconomy.com/NC_GlobalEconomy/tobacco/workers.shtml">in long-term decline</a>; textile mills and clothing-makers, <a href="http://www.ncglobaleconomy.com/textiles/workers.shtml">also shrinking</a> over the past generation due to competition from the Caribbean, Mexico, China, Japan, Korea, and elsewhere (we wrote about effects of this shift in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/city-makers-american-futures/category/greenville-sc/">South Carolina</a>, southwestern <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/lessons-from-danville/598432/">Virginia</a>, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/city-makers-american-futures/category/columbus-ms/">Mississippi</a>); and furniture-making, again mainly due to lower-cost competition from China.<br><br>
	This week <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-u-s-furniture-industry-is-backbut-there-arent-enough-workers-11575504528"><em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reports</a> on the return of furniture-making jobs in North Carolina—not to the levels of the late 1990s, but steadily increasing through the past decade. What’s the main limit on the expansion? For now it is the supply of skilled trades workers for these jobs. This is connected to two other trends we’ve seen and written about across the country in the past few years: the continued growth in relatively well-paying skilled trade jobs across the country—in construction, advanced-manufacturing, health services, repair-and-maintenance, wind- and solar-power projects, and so on. See a report from NPR here, and from a <a href="https://www.tradesmeninternational.com/news-events/job-outlook-skilled-trade-demand-growing-through-2024/">trades group here</a>.<br><br>
	The other trend is the crucial role of community colleges, and “career technical” programs in K-12 schools, in equipping students who need opportunities for the opportunities that now exist. I keep arguing (for instance, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/all/2019/08/traverse-city-michigan/595765/">here</a>) that community colleges are <em>the</em> institutions-of-the-moment, in increasing the chances for really inclusive economic growth. Soon I’ll give another example, from Dayton, Ohio. It’s one more reason to reading this <em>WSJ</em> piece by Ruth Simon.</li>
</ol><ol start="2" type="1"><li><em>People who leave small-town America, and people who return. </em>This week, the <em>PBS News Hour</em> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-millennials-are-moving-away-from-large-urban-centers">had a report</a> by Jeffrey Brown on Millennial-generation Americans who have a choice of where to work and live—and are choosing to live in small towns or rural areas. Obviously this is just in sync with what Deb Fallows and I have been observing from coast to coast.</li>
</ol><p>Of course this development does not mean that the pressure on very small areas has abated—the steady disappearance of rural-health facilities is one of the biggest challenges for small and rural areas trying to remain viable. And of course it does not mean that New York, Seattle, and San Francisco will lose their roles. But it’s an important <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/11/democrats-should-discuss-dislocation/602149/">complicating reality</a>: the re-peopling of some parts of “left-behind” America, with people who are looking for ways to bring new life to these areas.</p><ol start="3" type="1"><li><em>A “revenue lab” for local journalism</em>. The 10-year-old nonprofit <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/"><em>The</em> <i>Texas Tribune</i></a> has been one of the most important state-scale models of how journalism can re-establish itself, with a new financial model (as discussed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/11/the-lab-experiment-for-the-fourth-estate/601459/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/12/report-america-goes-big/602863/">here</a>). This week it announced a new “revenue and training lab,” to systematize, improve, and share models for sustainable local journalism.<br><br>
	As Evan Smith, CEO and co-founder of the <em>The</em> <em>Texas Tribune</em>, wrote <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/12/02/revenue-training-lab/">in an announcement</a>: “We’re creating our first-ever revenue and training lab—a freestanding entity, housed in our Austin newsroom, where we’ll experiment with innovative ways to fund local news, model best practices that we hope will benefit the entire ecosystem, and mentor and coach dozens of our would-be peers …. The RevLab, as we’ve already started to shorthand it … [will be devoted to] this noble pursuit of sustainability strategies for our industry.”</li>
</ol><ol start="4" type="1"><li><i>Examples of smaller-town functionality</i>. As part of CNN’s “Fractured States of America” series, kicked off <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/opinions/secret-bridge-political-division-burns/index.html">by Ken Burns</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/06/opinions/small-town-ajo-arizona-heal-divide-fallows/index.html">Deb Fallows has a piece</a> today on cases she’s seen of communities trying to heal rather than intensify national divides. It starts in our favorite southern-Arizona community of Ajo and moves to Sioux Falls and elsewhere. It also includes a photo of a very powerful piece of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/06/reparations-from-minnesota-to-mississippi/373340/">civically important public art</a>: the monument erected in Duluth, Minnesota, site of the northernmost lynching in U.S. history, to the three men unjustly killed there.</li>

    <div class="content " itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Here is one more dip into the waters of ancient Rome. For those joining us late:</p><ul><li>In a “thought experiment” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/in-the-fall-of-rome-good-news-for-america/596638/">article in the new issue</a> of the print magazine, I ask: What can troubled citizens of today’s America learn from the history of Rome? But the question concerned not the much-publicized lead up to “Decline and Fall.” Rather it was about the “After the Fall” era, known to the scholars at “Late Antiquity.”</li>
	<li>In <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/after-the-fall-what-rome-means-for-america/597526/">a first round of responses</a>, academic historians and others pushed back (mainly) against the headline of the article. The headline said, “The Fall of the Roman Empire Wasn’t That Bad.” The academics replied, “Oh yes it was!”</li>
	<li>Next, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/who-would-rather-be-living-in-the-13th-century-than-today/597592/">a governance expert</a> drew parallels between the “Late Antiquity” era and the tension between centralized efforts, and dispersed local innovations, that have been part of the American saga from the very start.</li>
	<li>Then, other readers suggested <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/im-not-tossing-in-the-towel-yet-rome-and-america/597673/">other ways</a> of making connections, contrasts, and implications.</li>
</ul><p>That brings us to what will probably be the wrap-up—but who knows. Here are several more messages, starting with a long one, about further extracting Rome-and-America comparisons and contrasts:</p><p>1) “<em>The empire made the emperors</em>.” In my article, I said that since World War II the United States has run an “empire without the name.” A historically minded reader draws out the implications:</p><blockquote>
<p>First, it’s entirely appropriate, as you do, to compare the Roman and American <i>empires—</i>even though the US rules its empire as Romans of the <em>republican</em> (not imperial) era did.  </p>

<p>In other words, the US empire is an “empire of obedience.” It uses all manner of tools to persuade semi-independent states and other groups to do its bidding, rather than directly governing territories within formal borders. Direct governance and a formalization of borders occurred under the Roman <i>princeps</i> (emperors).</p>

<p>Second, while it’s convenient to date the “fall” of the western Roman empire, it’s not especially useful from an analytic perspective. The western empire had been decentralizing for quite some time, while “barbarians” had been effectively ruling parts of it, directly and indirectly.   </p>

<p>It’s critical to note these groups did not conceive of themselves as “invading” or seeking to “overthrow” Roman rule. By and large, they were forced to enter Roman territory by other attackers. Their rulers were also, by and large, Romanized. They largely ruled in cooperation with local Roman elites and using Roman techniques. Odoacer positioned himself as a local Roman ruler formally subservient to the emperor in Constantinople.</p>

<p>What happened in the West was very different from what happened in the East, when the truly “foreign” armies of Islam invaded and conquered territory ….</p>

<p>Third, it’s a bit of a stretch to say decentralization that happened in the 4th and 5th centuries was necessary for developments that came into their own 1,000 years later. There were guild-like groups in 1st century Rome. The Romans appear to have developed fairly sophisticated credit systems and engaged in long-range trade. Monasteries flourished in the eastern empire, which remained quite centralized and even more heavily militarized. And so on.   </p>

<p>Could all of this had developed in something like the direction it took if the Roman state had not succumbed, over many years, to internal and external pressures? It’s impossible to say. But I also think it’s impossible to say it wouldn’t have.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>In my mind, here’s the most relevant lesson from Rome for current US developments: The emperors didn’t make the empire. The empire made the emperors.   </p>

<p>The US has had an emperor for decades, both through the taking of power and, more importantly (and in Roman fashion), through Congress delegating its powers to him. Trump’s willingness to use those powers has revealed what has been the case for some time.</p>
</blockquote><hr class="c-section-divider"><figure style="max-width: 672.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:73.6607142857%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/06070v/783f0fc94.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">Another scene from Constantinople, seat of the Eastern Empire long after the fall of Rome (<a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2001699435/">Library of Congress</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>2) “<em>Last Bastion of Democracy.</em>” The message below represents many I’ve received  to similar effect, about what America’s fate might mean for China’s influence.</p><blockquote>
<p>I’ll bet that the majority of people who lived under Roman rule and were not rich by their historic standards would argue that after Rome’s fall most of everything went to the crapper. Although the Romans were brutal at times, those under their rule were largely protected by Rome’s legions at the request of the local governor ….</p>

<p>Suggesting that America’s fall might not be so bad based on Rome’s fall and what occurred afterwards ignores the presence of Russia and China in the world today ………..</p>

<p>imagine a world without one of the last bastions of democracy, the one that feeds innovation and who has fed a large part of the world for decades. A world run by Putin and Xi, yea right, that would be pretty.</p>
</blockquote><hr class="c-section-divider"><figure style="max-width: 640.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:78.125%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/08420r/b654d615b.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">“Combat des Huns,” by Julius Thaeter (<a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2003689346/">Library of Congress</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>3)  “<em>Goths were very popular</em>.” A reader who is conducting historical research, and who prefaces his note with an (unnecessary) apology for errors in English he might make as a non-native speaker, writes about why “barbarian” cultures spread so rapidly in Rome’s absence:</p><blockquote>
<p>I just read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammianus_Marcellinus">Ammianus Marcellinus</a>’ account (among many others) of the accelerated decline of the Empire in the second half of the 4th century and how it lead to its fall a century later.</p>

<p>One fact seldom mentioned about Romanity and Greco-Roman culture is how the people that lived under it seemed to deeply hate it.</p>

<p>A reoccurring fact of the era is how local populations defected to the barbarian tribes massively. People joined the Goths, the Lombards, the Franks and even the Huns in their wars against their own country! Goths were very popular among the population, even when then besieged Rome, we hear about the Roman plebs joining forces with their attackers.<br><br>
Whole provinces that had been deeply Romanised, even colonized by Romans adopted Barbarian customs so quickly it looks like they were not conquered but liberated. Gaul, Italy, Moesia (in today’s Bulgaria) went over the Barbarians in some cases as fast as a generation. By the 6th century, Italians—<i>Italians</i>!—were proud to call themselves Lombards. …</p>

<p>There are many reasons for that; the institution of slavery, the degradation and corruption of civic institutions and services, the turbulent switch from a multireligious Empire to a monotheist and rigidly orthodox quasi-Theocracy.</p>

<p>From reading A. Marcellinus, I was surprised to learn that in fact, Roman civilisation at that point was only working were the emperor was currently residing. As soon as the emperor moved, law, order and good administration collapsed. This is probably why the Emperors in the 4th century were constantly on the move ….</p>

From a reader in the Midwest:</p><p>1) My takeaway from decades-ago reading was that European technology, commerce, wealth surpassed Roman levels around 1100 or so. If that’s right, there was a dark age in concrete senses. The trend among historians I read in graduate school was to push the Renaissance back earlier and earlier, but not to deny that there were losses requiring a renaissance.</p><blockquote>
<p>Then again, who knows, maybe they were wrong, and/or current revisionism has shrunk the dark age (rightly or questionably)  to nothing.</p>

<p>2. If the U.S. federal government continues its descent it will probably take malign forms that will suffocate or actively crush effective local government and other cultural capital. …</p>

<p>5. The question of whether our federal government is on a permanent downward trajectory raises the question of risk/reward in the most radical proposed norm-breaking for a narrow Democratic majority: filibuster end, new state creation [JF note: eg, Puerto Rico, D.C., court packing]. Maybe we’re at the point where risk-taking is the most prudent course—a grab to activate the emerging demographic majority before Republicans manage to suppress democracy altogether.</p>

<p>6. The Pax Romana was also real (or was it?), and the end of Pax Americana may prove very dangerous.</p>

<p>7. Environmental pressure—rising seas, desertification, natural disasters—is probably already driving and will continue driving government dysfunction, while government dysfunction accelerates environmental degradation.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>I am not entirely despairing. It’s always hard to tell what ills are cyclical and which ones are one-way streets. No one in the 1980s would have dreamed that crime in the U.S. would go into major remission; maybe mysterious forces will dissipate extreme polarization—and we’ll build new defenses against fake news/brainwashing in free societies. Maybe major technological breakthrough (or an ice age) will save us from global warming.</p>

<p>But it’s hard to get too cheery about compensations for [the end of] a functioning federal government.</p>

    <p>The new print issue of the magazine has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/in-the-fall-of-rome-good-news-for-america/596638/">a short thought-experiment article</a>, by me, on what happened after the fall of the Roman empire. (As I point out, this concerned the Western empire only—the one based in Italy, and the one Edward Gibbon described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_the_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire"><em>The Decline and Fall</em></a>. The Eastern empire, based in Constantinople, had many more centuries to run.)</p><p>In a first round <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/after-the-fall-what-rome-means-for-america/597526/">of reader responses</a>, historians and others reacted (mainly) to the article’s (intentionally overstated) headline, “The End of the Roman Empire Wasn’t That Bad.” And in a second round, a veteran of governance issues named Eric Schnurer <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/who-would-rather-be-living-in-the-13th-century-than-today/597592/">argued that</a> a renewed focus on local-level renewal and innovation was proper, since localities were the only places where innovation had ever occurred.</p><p>Here is another round, on the point I mainly hoped the article would raise: how Americans, ever optimistic about the rebound capacity of their perpetually self-reinventing system, should think about the possibility that “it’s different this time,” and that national-level governance might finally be strained beyond its rebound abilities. Over to the readers:</p><p>1) <em>Civil servants still want to serve</em>. In my article I quoted Philip Zelikow, of the University of Virginia, on the difference between national-level and local officials. At the state, local, and regional level, Zelikow said, elected and career officials have no choice but to work together and actually solve problems. Whereas at the national level, politics is more and more about culture war—“who you like, who you hate, which side you’re on,” as Zelikow put it.</p><p>A career official at a national-level agency replies:</p><blockquote>
<p>In November, I will mark 32 years of federal service.</p>

<p>My grandparents came here with nothing. I’m an age of rising tides; my parents had the grit and good fortune to grant me and my brothers and sisters every reasonable opportunity, and then some.</p>

<p>That’s fundamentally why I entered public service, and that’s fundamentally why I remain in public service. I am grateful, and feel a responsibility to give back.</p>

<p>Your essay, comparing our federal state to Rome in its age of decline, strikes a chord, and in doing so fills me with an undeniable melancholy.</p>

<p>I push back against Zelikow’s “which side are you on” fatalism about national governance, even as I admit I see evidence of it all around me.</p>

<p>I’m not tossing in the towel yet.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about that [Roman] period quite a bit lately, as we see the collapse of societal norms and the failure of many central governments to actually govern.</p>

<p>I see the present as actually more in parallel to the fall of the republic in the first century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.E</span>.</p>

<p>At that time, the empire had begun to take form, with vast amounts of wealth pouring into the center, but mainly enriching the senatorial oligarchs. The men who had fought the wars were forced off their land, which came to be farmed on vast plantations by slaves. The new global order failed the yeomen, mainly because the rich, who controlled the government, refused to relinquish any of their wealth to help the impoverished citizens.</p>

<p>Seems familiar.</p>

<p>The society broke into two warring parties: <em>Optimates</em> and <em>Populares</em> (the “Best” and the “People”). They engaged in wars with each other, mobilizing personal armies, and violence came to be used as a means of government with leaders of each side being killed by mobs, culminating in the death of Julius Caesar. The society had become so divided that in the end, the only way to govern was by autocratic rule: Augustus.</p>

<p>I fear that we are near that point, and that a demagogue will arise who has more shrewdness than our current demagogue-wannabe. Trump has blazed the pathway that others can well follow.</p>

<p>Trump’s party represents the <em>Optimates</em>—the wealthy—but we could just as well see a leader representing the <em>Populares</em> come to power. Think if Huey Long had been successful in the 1930s. Populism can cut both ways; call them national populism and social populism …</p>

<p>We are seeing the breakdown of liberal democracy across the world, as happened in the 1930s. It was finally restored after a decade of slaughter. It may not be restored again. At the least, something new has to take form, and that will not come from our generation.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>One interesting parallel to the period that you do discuss in your piece is that the “barbarians” were not invading the empire to loot and pillage. Mainly, they wanted to share in the wealthy and stable Roman society, get a bit of land for their people, and be secure from tribes like the Huns on the other side of the border. They knew Rome very well; many of their leaders had been leaders in the Roman armies, and many were Roman citizens. The Vandals were not really that vandalous …</p>

<p>In the same way, people are now migrating en masse into Europe and the U.S. in pursuit of better lives, to participate in the wealthy and stable Western societies, to escape poverty and brutality.</p>

<p>Climate change plays a significant role in driving people out of their homelands, and that will only become worse over time. Another factor, of course, is Western as well as internecine wars (think Iraq and Syria), and Western support of brutal governments (Central America).</p>

<p>But the influx of a mass of outsiders into the Roman empire (especially the western part) did ultimately lead to the breakdown of the wealth and stability they had come for.</p>

<p>There were many reasons for this, including intertribal battling among the newcomers and the disappearance of the Roman legions as a controlling force, but there was a continuing social disintegration and insecurity. The stable Roman <em>civitas</em> crumbled, quickly in some places (Britain) and more slowly in others (Gaul). I am not bringing this up to agree with Trump’s mantra to “build the wall” (which is folly—the Romans tried in some places), but rather to stress that we must have a rational immigration policy and consensus that prevents destabilization. Mass immigration creates nationalist anger, which is fuel for nationalist demagogues.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>As the Roman society disintegrated, government did become ever more localized. That worked for a while in some places (like France), but in time trade shrank, education declined, government services passed away, and instability increased.</p>

<p>One could imagine some parts of the U.S. doing quite well for a time without a federal government, but other parts might do very poorly. Infrastructure would fall apart, as it did in post-Roman Europe. More people would flow across unpoliced borders, adding to the disruption and to the reactions. This would not play well in a society as well armed as the U.S.</p>

<p>No one knew that “Rome had fallen” when Odoacer brushed aside the grandly named Romulus Augustulus in 476, only that the Germans now ruled Italy in name as they had in fact for the past decades. Even in our own long lives, can we know what history might see as having passed in our lifetimes, perhaps that we are now at the transition from the 500-year Modern Age into what-we-do-not-know (as John Lukacs has written)? Life went on, as for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-fallows/boiledfrog/">the frog in boiling water</a> whom you have analyzed …</p>

<p>Several hundred years after the fall of Rome, new forms and new states began to take shape amid the ruins, and by the 12th century, western Europe was again thriving. But it was a long and difficult time between the fall of the empire and the rise of Europe. I would not wish that on my children and grandchildren, or on theirs.</p>

<p>The long-term results of the failure of governance we are living through will be regrettable, though perhaps as necessary as the Dark Ages.</p>
</blockquote><hr class="c-section-divider"><p>3) <em>The new corporate “nationality.”</em> A Westerner who has lived for years in Japan writes about the local-versus-national tensions within the United States:</p><blockquote>
<p>One idea is to reorganize the 50 states into seven regions that match the baby bells created when AT&amp;T was broken up … The merits to such a reorganization are to unify many basic services: Do we really need 50 DMVs and 50 Medicaid programs and who knows how many other layers of bureaucracy that get repeated state by state? This could enhance basic services at the subnational level … On the other hand, it may create the equivalent of seven proconsuls competing among themselves to follow Rome’s decline into empire …</p>

<p>What seems more likely to me to occur over the next 50 years, and something that I oppose, is a rift, with sovereign-individual stance married to the corporatization of society …</p>

<p>Instead of citizenship being based on contiguous borders, our lives are bounded by what membership card(s) we carry. I can go to an Amazon condominium after buying dinner at Whole Foods paid for by my Amazon coins via my Kindle and travel in my Amazon car ad infinitum. And if I am a Sapphire member, better deals as I jump from location to location but stay in the Amazon or Apple or Goggle or Facebook or whatever bubble. When a person uses an “out of service” provider, of course rates go up, and pity the people who cannot afford/are rejected in their membership bids. <em>Blade Runner</em> marries <em>Brave New World</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, on the question of if this time is different compared with other times due to change! change! change! Yes and no. I believe that in past periods, starting around 1870, in these early periods, the degree of change was much greater than now. No electricity versus Wi-Fi and rechargeable batteries; no telephones/movies/radios versus watching reality TV on your cellphone, etc., etc.</p>

<p>But the pace of change does seem to be much faster and disconcerting for all generations. This deserves further explanation, but who has the time to read, let alone write … ?</p>

Cameron of the Ben-Hur chariot race in Rome (<a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/95521691/">Library of Congress</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>4) <em>Let’s talk about ideology, and class</em>. Another academic writes (in a message I am substantially boiling down):</p><blockquote>
<p>1) I have spent the past seven years studying the Eastern Roman empire, which is usually called “Byzantium,” and which Gibbon himself dismissed as basically the 1,000-year decline of the Roman empire.</p>

<p>His is a monstrous oversimplification, and it has degraded our understanding of ancient/medieval history ever since Gibbon’s own day (1776), just as Adam Smith’s dismissal of the timelessness of mercantilism has degraded our English-speaking understanding of ancient/medieval economics ever since the same time (1776). [<em>JF note</em>: On the Adam Smith point, check out <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1993/12/how-the-world-works/305854/">this article, by me</a>, from 25-plus years ago.]</p>

<p>Given what is already well known about how the U.S. so-called Founding Fathers (itself an egregious simplification of the revolutionary generation) understood the transition of republican Rome into the empire, before we sink our teeth into late-antique history, it might be worth remembering that our understanding of the past, especially the more distant past, is ALWAYS (and has always been) subject to the political machinations of the present, and even historians’ own careers aren’t guided so much by how well they interpret the past, but by how well their interpretations suit the sensibilities of the times in which they happen to be writing …</p>

<p>[<em>JF note</em>: Leaving out point No. 2, a long discourse on the difficulty of understanding the real life of peasants in different eras of history.]</p>

<p>3) Generations are important for understanding deep history. For the past 70 years, young generations of Americans have been told that they ought to be living better than their parents. That was fine for the Boomers and for Gen Xers, but this is clearly not the case for Millennials.</p>

<p>So we were lied to. Big surprise. So were the generations who fought for and against Prohibition, slavery, and Unionization (and for Odoacer as well, arguably). Why else would (according to the 1860 U.S. census) a majority of non-slave-owning Southern whites sign up to fight for the cause of Confederate slavery at the outbreak of the American Civil War? …</p>

<p>4) Let’s not forget the power of ideology in the present. In the fifth-century present, Christianity (and Judaism and the various forms of Paganism) was as much part and parcel of social cornerstones as the ideology of the “American dream,” “intersectionality,” and “MAGA” is today …</p>

<p>The point is that we should never underestimate the power of ideology to bind people to a common cause, whether in the fifth century, the 11th century, or the 21st century. Ultimately, we as historians dismiss the significance of religion (and collective conviction) at our own peril.</p>

<p>5) Finally, class. With the rapid adoption of Christian laws and social structures throughout the Roman empire during and after the fourth century, the rigid laws fossilized a system of landowners (fief holders) and land workers (peasants).</p>

<p>The road to serfdom is something that ever since Hayek has been capitalized by the likes of Ayn Rand and her disciples, but it truly begins with the rules that one class lives by and another class lives above.</p>

<p>This may sound quite Marxist, but that’s because it is. Without centralized regulations, we automatically return to a system of landowners and toilers, whether we call them ancient/medieval sharecroppers or modern bartenders. When ideology is co-opted by the elites to perpetuate their children to inherit their elite status (whether we call it aristocracy or meritocracy), we return to the so-called Dark Ages.</p>

<p>This is not simply “Marxism”; it is historical materialism. And it is the only actually reliable guide to studying the past that we have ever truly innovated since the time of Marcus Aurelius.</p>
</blockquote><hr class="c-section-divider"><figure style="max-width: 640.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:75.15625%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/Bath/9c2a83d4e.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">Roman-era baths in Bath, England, from an early-20th-century image (<a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2002696370/">Library of Congress</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>5) “<em>I believe in America.</em>” And, finally, quite a different view of the ever present, ever reinterpreted past:</p><blockquote>
<p>As the famous first line in the movie <em>The Godfather</em> reads, “I believe in America.”</p>

<p>While many of us continue to do so, an alarming number of Americans have fallen victim to the in-vogue critique that “woe is me” and things are awful.</p>

<p>For some, this is a reality. I read stories about the homeless problem in major U.S. cities, how drug addiction and tolerance of theft are literally robbing thriving communities of their once-proud fortitude of citizenship. I read daily how Big Tech companies are continuing to mislead the American public about how they monitor and police speech and content their employees regard as offensive, and God knows what with our personal information …</p>

<p>But what I mostly don’t see now is pride—pride in how fortunate we are to live in this country. It’s called gratitude …</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>Talk to someone middle-aged who grew up in Soviet Eastern Europe, and you’ll find out quickly why they left for America. We now live in a world where we can get anything we want, at any time of the day. Nearly all buildings and houses have central air-conditioning. Transportation is readily available for everyone. The economy is currently booming with employment we haven’t seen in three generations. Murder rates are at all-time lows. There hasn’t been a serious threat to the homeland in 19 years. There’s a new superhero movie out every three months in theaters. Netflix programming has people indulging on their couches more than ever.</p>

<p>Most people who are angry and disheartened have never known a world like the Dark Ages, the Black Plague, serfdom, smallpox, the Great Depression, WWII, or even the height of the Cold War. And we have room to complain that America sucks?</p>

<p>One of the reasons the Roman empire fell was not because of physical overextension by the state (which is true), but by its people taking for granted what the Roman empire had done for the modern world …</p>

<p>Is it any coincidence many of the founding era sought to emulate Roman law and antiquity as they established the republican virtues and culture of the 1780s to the 1820s? And what’s more, many of the Founders warned, much like the scholars of latter-day Rome, what would likely be the downfall of the continent and our country: indifference and ingratitude from within for what America meant as an idea …</p>

<p>The truth, in my opinion, is that 9/11 sapped us of our confidence. And the ensuing years of lies, mismanaged wars, and bank bailouts; an incoherent foreign policy over multiple administrations; and now the rise of brash and offensive populism in both ideological camps have Americans feeling more anxious than ever …</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>Perhaps we should be devoting much more to teaching civics again, and appreciating the separation of powers, appreciating why men like James Madison, George Mason, John Adams, Gouverneur Morris, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington matter so much that it is in our individual interest to be informed of who they were and what they did to establish the freedoms we often take for granted.</p>

<p>More so, it’s about time we recognize African American contributions during the founding era, too. In spite of their plight, we should be recognizing Peter Salem, Phillis Wheatley, James Armistead Lafayette, and James Forten. We should be embracing the fact that the Continental Army of 1781 was color-blind; that it stood about one-fifth African American at the Siege of Yorktown is extraordinary. Or that women and some African Americans were voting in New Jersey prior to 1807…</p>

<p>When we stop paying attention to all of the noise, and when we regain our focus, the fog will begin to clear, and King’s pronouncement of seeking to reach “the promised land” will once again ring loudly for those of us who are yearning for a more perfect union: one of freedom and liberty for all.</p>

    <div class="content " itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>What’s the point of writing a “thought experiment” article, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/in-the-fall-of-rome-good-news-for-america/596638/">like mine</a> in the current issue about the bright side of the Dark Ages?</p><p>It’s to generate some thoughts! On top of the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/after-the-fall-what-rome-means-for-america/597526/">first round of responses</a>—which were variations on “Actually, the Dark Ages were pretty dark”—here is a stand-alone. It is from my longtime friend <a href="http://www.ericschnurer.com/">Eric Schnurer</a>, who has worked in and written extensively (including <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/eric-schnurer/">for <em>The Atlantic</em></a>) about governance at all levels, from the local to the global.</p><p>He writes now about the proper lessons to be drawn from comparing modern America’s prospects to those of Rome, after the fall. What follows is a long but highly condensed version of his note. I would direct your attention to the place where he ends his argument: Local innovation is important now, <em>and always has been</em>. The difference now is the potential and scale of global/local connections.</p><p>Over to Schnurer. I have added some subheads <strong>in bold</strong> to highlight the stages of his argument—which, again, I hope you’ll think through to the end:</p><blockquote>
<p>I read with interest your piece on the fall of the Roman empire … in part because of the fact that you were <i>really</i> discussing a number of contemporary issues of obvious interest to me.</p>

<p>I think of these being less the local aspect, and more the large-scale global future …</p>

<p><strong>It’s not the fall of the Roman empire we should worry about. It’s the fall of the Roman republic. </strong>One could argue that the fall of Rome wasn’t so “awful” [<em>JF note</em>: This is Edward Gibbons’s term], because, by that time, Rome was pretty “awful” itself. The empire’s peak— particularly the heights of both power and intellectual advance of the Five Good Emperors—was long behind it.</p>

<p>However much as I may like Trajan and Marcus Aurelius (and I always found it interesting that <i>Gladiator</i> set its story in this period, and has Russell Crowe restore democracy at the end, as if to fantasize how great Rome would be if the history we know had simply ended after Trajan and we then got to go back to the republic … ), Rome’s true greatness begins and ends for me (and I suspect for you and most of your readers) with the Roman republic. In fact, I don’t think the problem with the U.S. today is that it resembles Rome at the end of the empire, but rather that it resembles Rome at the end of the republic.</p>

<p>Or, rather, not long before, with the rise of the Gracchi—the increasing economic inequality, the increasing political polarization, the total eclipse of “the greater good” by what we’d call “special interests,” the turn toward political violence, all of which led eventually to the spiral of destructive civil war, the collapse of democracy (such as it was), and the wholesale replacement of the system with the imperial dictatorship: Looks a lot like the present moment to me …</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p><strong>The real question: Where is America headed? </strong>Sure, you can talk about the growth of monasteries and universities in the Dark Ages as a wonderful thing, but (a) what we really mean by that is how wonderful it is that there were islands of light in what was otherwise a sea of darkness, (b) that darkness went on a long time, (c) what came out of it, which you/we now celebrate as the result, was essentially:</p>

<ul><li>the rediscovery of the lost knowledge of Greece and Rome (not to mention the Islamic world) that kindled the Renaissance and Enlightenment;</li>
	<li>the reemergence of something resembling “globalization”; and</li>
	<li>the end of the horrific destructiveness of the Middle Ages—due largely to the institution of local fiefdoms that your piece celebrates as a sort of Brandeisian laboratory—thanks to their replacement by the modern nation-state and the European state system, which represented a recentralization of authority and stability, not a devolution.</li>
</ul><p>What I actually find more interesting is what your piece says about where we’re <i>headed</i>, which is what I’ve been focusing on, lo! these many years.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p><strong>Seeing the world through a distorted 20th-century lens</strong>. I think there’s a tendency—especially among people of your/my generation [<em>JF note</em>: For me, the dreaded Baby Boomers]—to see major change and progress coming in large-scale, centralized, and particularly federal efforts.</p>

<p>This is a warping effect that the civil-rights and Vietnam eras, with a dose of coming-right-after-the-FDR-<wbr></wbr>era, has had on our understanding of U.S. history.</p>

<p>I’ve seen it in myself and like-minded peers who went into law to change the world and discovered, by the time we got out of law school, that the court system is reactionary and basically always has been that way, except for about six years; the idea that the Supreme Court is the great instrument for social advance that gets us around the parochial-ness of our politics has it exactly backwards.</p>

<p>This is symptomatic of a larger misperception: Yes, great changes come suddenly and on a grand scale—but to say that that’s “the change” is to misunderstand the chaotic nature of all systems.</p>

<p>Sand piles collapse all at once, scientific revolutions occur due to sudden “paradigm shifts,” civil-rights and Reagan revolutions and the rise of Trump/Brexitism burst on the scene—but these are long-term dynamics that may have large-scale effects but play out on the level of individual grains of sand.</p>

<p>There’s a great George Bernard Shaw line about the moment of success occurring long before the moment that it is apparent to the crowd; this is true of just about everything. <i>Brown v. Board</i> took 40 years of small litigation steps—not to mention dramatic changes throughout society, including the integration of the armed forces during and after WWII, just as the massive mobilizations of the peasantry in the Napoleonic Wars led eventually to the democratization of Europe. The big events are the capstones—they are <i>always</i> driven and made possible by small-scale, localized innovations that eventually flow together into what is by then an inevitable deluge.</p>

<p>Brown’s and Scheidel’s celebration of the breakup of the empire as allowing local innovations strikes me as wrong in the same sort of way: These local innovations are always occurring, because that’s <i>where innovation occurs</i>.</p>

<p>This is like the discussion I’m having these days with my 26-year-old niece, who wants to go overturn the entire capitalist and food-production systems to bring about the millennium; having once been 26, I get it, but I have to keep telling her that, with rare exceptions like the Russian Revolution, French Revolution, Taiping Kingdom, etc., you rarely get to upheave the entire system all at once—and when you do, it usually doesn’t turn out too well … In any event, my argument would really be that all of those were not sudden upheavals, any more than Trump’s election was; they were simply culminations of longer trends that started from smaller scale “innovations.”</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p><strong>The enlightening place to look is always local</strong>. If you want to know where the world is headed, you need to find the unknown lunatics toiling away in a lab in Menlo Park, New Jersey, or a patent office in Basel, or a garage in Menlo Park, California, or the mayor’s office in South Bend—not what the world leaders and experts are saying … I don’t know if finding what people are up to should be encouraging of optimism—I mean, some local innovation includes some bizarre people meeting in Munich beer halls who a decade later launch WWII—but it’s <i>instructive </i>…</p>

<p>Local is where <i>most</i> people <i>always</i> choose to get involved: It’s not just the current dysfunctionality that channels most people into school-board meetings instead of seeking to draft new national legislation. Some small number of crazy people like you and me are drawn to the latter, but that’s a distinct minority, always has been, and always will be.</p>

<p>My work has brought me into contact with people all around the country who were thinking about productive little ideas about how to improve their neighborhoods, their kid’s school, their small business and how it affected their workers, etc. … My contribution has been largely in <i>recognizing</i> them and thinking, <em>Hey, that would make a great basis for a “program” that my candidate could propose, scale up, and fund as governor!</em></p>

<p>I eventually concluded—as has anyone I know who has thought about government systems from the standpoint of achieving results instead of promoting one’s career—that what state and (ESPECIALLY) national governments do is simply to fund to-scale solutions someone else has discovered, tested, and proved at an “atomic” level …</p>

<p>The way to make a contribution is to go start a school that works, or a neighborhood organization that solves a problem …</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p><strong>Coming to a “point of rupture,” which sounds bad, but … </strong>And that takes us to where we’re actually headed as a result. You quote Morley Winograd talking about “networked localities” taking control of global policy. I think that’s <i>sorta</i> correct: In the Aztec language, there’s a phenomenon of two words being placed together to mean something both synergistic and different from the words separately; e.g., “the flower the song” meant “poetry,” and “the water the fire” meant “conquest” or “destruction.”</p>

<p>I think you need to look at your/Winograd’s phrase <em>networked localities</em> in the same way: It’s not just, or even, about the devolution to localities—the “networked” part is essential, and changes the meaning.</p>

<p>Your own work focuses very much on local action and innovation; I’ve been arguing that the virtual world fundamentally changes all of this: It undermines territorial structures like nation-states and the new world order—in that way, Brexit, Scottish devolution, California and even cities going their own way on the Paris accords, cities globally becoming the players rather than nation-states, etc., are all foreseeable developments …</p>

<p>I think we will start developing worldwide “communities” that are not physically connected, but rather are “localized” in the sense of being nodes of innovation or communication or consumption or whatever in a non-physically-contiguous/nonphysical network …</p>

<p>And that’s ultimately what the post-empire question is about. The entire system of civilization as we know it—not simply “the American empire”—is coming to a point of rupture. There may very well be a largely recognizable U.S. at the end of it (although I doubt it), but that will be irrelevant, because the world in which that U.S. is embedded—its political structures, its economic structures, its entire intellectual framework, and its physical manifestations—will all have changed as radically as the 13th century is from today.</p>

<p>And all that massive change will happen massively more quickly than in the 13th century … I write and talk about stuff like this, and people think it sounds “awful” and scary. Where I perhaps share a bit of your optimism is that <i>I don’t.</i></p>

<p>Sure, the entire world as we know it being wiped away sounds scary, but it’s not necessarily “awful.” If you told people in the 13th century about the world today—family, church, village, political overlord, entire basis of the economy, entire intellectual framework (“Evolution?” “Relativity?” “Quantum mechanics?”), all as you knew them completely gone—they’d think that 100 percent awful. But do you know <i>a single person</i> who would rather be living in the 13th century than today?</p>

    <p>The new issue of the print magazine contains a story by me called “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/in-the-fall-of-rome-good-news-for-america/596638/">The End of the Roman Empire Wasn’t That Bad</a>.”</p><p>The title (which, like most titles, I didn’t write) represented (like many titles) intentional overstatement-for-effect. But the point of the piece was to suggest that maybe Americans should shift the way they talked and thought about the Roman Empire as a metaphor for this country.</p><p>For as long as there has been an American republic, some Americans have worried about its impending Roman-style decline and fall. I said: What about the time <em>after</em> Rome fell? What could we learn by imagining ourselves in our version of the Dark Ages—with a failed system of central governance, and life going on at the duchy-by-duchy, monastery-by-monastery level, which for us would mean cities, states, and regions?</p><p>You can read <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/in-the-fall-of-rome-good-news-for-america/596638/">the whole thing</a> yourself—and it isn’t even very long.</p><p><figure class="c-embedded-video"><div class="embed-wrapper" style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMJQzQhuJ8o?enablejsapi=1"></iframe></div></figure></p><p>Readers have weighed in with a range of views.</p><p>In this first roundup, I’ll highlight only critical ones. You’ll see some common themes here, expressed with clarity and erudition that make it a privilege to reach this kind of readership—even when, as now, they’re <s>giving me a hard time</s> writing in to disagree. I’ll have a brief response at the end.</p><p>Let’s begin:</p><ol type="1"><li><em>Not “transition” but “collapse.”</em> From a reader in an academic post:</li>
</ol><blockquote>
<p>Oh my, you dove into a nasty controversy here. While scholars like Peter Brown and Walter Goffart make an  interesting case about “transition,” people like Bryan Ward-Perkins have made what I think is a more compelling case about “collapse of civilization.”</p>

<p>A few things to keep in mind—and on these no one debates:</p>

<ul><li>Population fell. That is a vaguely neutral sounding term, but that is shorthand for murder, rape, starvation, and disease.</li>
	<li>Literacy diminished dramatically or was largely lost.</li>
	<li>Material possessions diminished in quality and quantity. People were poorer.</li>
</ul><p>I know you are on a pitch about the renewal of our country at the local level. I think that is wishful thinking, but whatever. But the Roman example is a doleful one. Yes, some institutions thrived, but people didn’t. They became poorer, less secure, and less literate.</p>

<p>Seeing the Fall/Transition of the Roman empire as anything other than a human catastrophe is an interesting academic exercise, but let’s keep it at that.</p>
</blockquote><hr class="c-section-divider"><ol start="2" type="1"><li><em>“The roofs have rushed to earth, towers in ruins.”</em>  From another reader, who in his day job is a successful software designer. (This is Mark Bernstein, <a href="http://eastgate.com/">of Eastgate</a>, designer of the program <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> and long-ago <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/02/todays-glimpse-into-the-world-of-software-writing/272761/">guest blogger</a> on this site, when “guest blogging” was a thing.)</li>
</ol><blockquote>
<p>The indispensable book on the end of Rome in the West is Bryan Ward-Perkins, <i><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-fall-of-rome-9780192807281">The Fall Of Rome and the End of Civilization</a>.</i>  It’s a very short book, it’s important, and it’s fun to read.</p>

<p>One key observation: in the 4th century, an impoverished Italian shepherd ate his dinner on imported tableware, drank imported wine and seasoned his salad with imported oil. He covered his roof (and maybe his manger’s roof as well) in mass-produced roof tiles. In the 6th century, the proudest possessions of kings were fancy safety pins, and their palaces were wooden halls with thatched roofs. In the years of the Empire, Rome imported so much olive oil that the 53 million decommissioned amphorae now form the hill of Monte Testaccio. In the eighth, kings made do with whatever the local brewers could manage, and poured for their guests from decorated beakers made next door.</p>

<p>In the fourth century, Romans built the Old St. Peters and repurposed the Lateran; it’s been through lots of rebuilding but the Roman building was about the modern size.  It’s big. In the sixth century, they built Santa Maria In Aracoeli—a small building, constructed on some of Rome’s prime real estate out of mismatched scraps and bits of junk. The junk was nicer than anything money could buy.  And they built S. Agnese fuori-le-mura, which is the size of a nice house.</p>

<p>A Pompeiian perfume-seller left us long brothel graffiti as a tribute to a lovely evening. Lots of poor people left us graffiti. Charlemagne never quite managed to learn to write.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, we know too little about what happened to North Africa in this era. It wasn’t pretty. In the second century, North Africa was a real economic powerhouse and a huge food exporter. The irrigation system was wrecked in battles over tax cuts for wealthy estate-owners, and that was that. It was an ecological disaster that made the Western Empire unsupportable.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>I’m not sure that the delocalization of governance in the West is an encouraging lesson, either. Yes, there were bright spots—Lindesfarne, Kells, Aachen, Kyev—but they were bright in contrast to the prevailing misery. Look at the opening of <i>The Ruin </i>(trans.

        <ol start="3" type="1"><li>“<em>More like Mad Max than Renaissance Italy.”</em> From another reader:</li>
</ol><blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed reading your recent article “The End of the Roman Empire Wasn’t That Bad”, but if I may suggest, I think you are seriously conflating the outcome (modern society) with the experience of the people actually living through that time.</p>

<p>The relative paucity of written history and literature from the time shortly after the end of the Roman Empire or the general loss of Roman control in the outlying territories such as Britain and North Africa doesn’t leave us a lot of descriptions of what life was like in the 400s, 500s, or 600s, but what we do know is that populations dropped sharply, the quality of building and art decreased substantially, and there was the aforementioned almost complete absence of writing, excepting perhaps a few monasteries.</p>

<p>Since presumably people don’t actually vanish, this suggests strongly that there was a period of starvation, disease, and generalized violence that caused the decline in population and the local populaces to simply focus on staying alive, rather than having a relatively rich society able to indulge in luxuries like the theater, writing, and grand monument construction.</p>

<figure style="max-width: 672.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:124.404761905%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/3c02915u-1/6ef45def2.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">17<sup>th</sup> century etching of Roman ruins, by Stefano della Bella (Library of Congress)</figcaption></figure><p>Consider that Rome, a city of probably around a million people at its height, had declined to around 5,000 people by the time of Justinian’s attempt to reconquer Italy in the 500s and at one point in these conflicts may have been completely deserted. The territories of the former Roman empire had transformed from a sophisticated trading network where massive (for the time) cities could be supported by farms hundreds of miles away, to one where people were literally farming and grazing cattle in the ruins of the Roman Forum. You don’t get to this kind of population reduction without a lot suffering along the way.</p>

<p>I’d suggest that rather than being “not that bad”, the conditions for the average Roman citizen and their immediate descendants in the centuries after the collapse of Roman rule were apocalyptic; more like Mad Max than Renaissance Italy. Consider that people were literally living in the ruins of a civilization far more sophisticated than their own, with no idea or knowledge of how these structures could have been built, with lives that were likely shorter and more subject to disease and starvation.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>It may be true that viewed a thousand years from now, the breakup of America might be viewed as a positive thing by historians of the time.  When we look back at Rome, it’s relatively easy to leap from 476 AD to Michelangelo and Leonardo, buzzing by the intervening hundreds of years. But I’d suggest, that the immediate aftermath of a collapse of American government would be a period of starvation, of poverty, and of violence as the successor states fought over who got to control the remnants of the American military machine.</p>

<p>Imagine a number of chaotic, starving, impoverished nuclear armed states, not necessarily friendly to each other, with the remnants of the world’s most powerful military, and its hard to conceive that it would end well for the people living through that time.</p>
</blockquote><hr class="c-section-divider"><ol start="4" type="1"><li><em>Pax Romana vs Pax Americana</em>. Another reader, with a list:</li>
</ol><blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed your seeds-sprout-in-the-ruins piece about the possible upsides of declining federal capacity. A few thoughts/caveats:</p>

<p>1. My takeaway from decades-ago reading was that European technology, commerce, wealth surpassed Roman levels around 1100 or so.  If that’s right, there was a dark age in concrete senses …</p>

<p>2. If the U.S. federal government continues its descent it will probably take malign forms that will suffocate or actively crush effective local government and other cultural capital …</p>

<p>4. Someone in the last couple of years wrote up a vision of a kind of soft U.S. breakup via extended regional pacts. Ah, Google … it was <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/maybe-its-time-for-america-to-split-up.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567806032978000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH85us0OwYCD59-ktpoDEq4_Z7mjg" href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/maybe-its-time-for-america-to-split-up.html" target="_blank">Sasha Issenberg</a>, more recently than I guessed.</p>

<p>5. The question of whether our federal government is on a permanent downward trajectory raises the question of risk/reward in the most radical proposed norm-breaking for a narrow Democratic majority: filibuster end, new state creation, court packing. Maybe we’re at the point where risk-taking is the most prudent course—a grab to activate the emerging demographic majority before Republicans manage to suppress democracy altogether.</p>

<p>6. The Pax Romana was also real (or was it?), and the end of Pax Americana may prove very dangerous.</p>

<p>7. Environmental pressure—rising seas, desertification, natural disasters—is probably already driving and will continue driving government dysfunction, while government dysfunction accelerates environmental degradation.</p>

<p>I am not entirely despairing. It’s always hard to tell what ills are cyclical and which ones are one-way streets. No one in the 1980s would have dreamed that crime in the U.S. would go into major remission; maybe mysterious forces will dissipate extreme polarization—and we’ll build new defenses against fake news/brainwashing in free societies. Maybe major technological breakthrough (or an ice age) will save us from global warming.</p>

<p>But it’s hard to get too cheery about compensations for a functioning federal government.</p>
</blockquote><hr class="c-section-divider"><ol start="5" type="1"><li><em>Filling the vacuum</em>. Finally for today, from a reader who, it’s relevant to point out, has a Chinese family name:</li>
</ol><blockquote>
<p>The end of the Roman Empire might have created a vacuum in which new ideas could grow, leading to the development of modern western civilization. But who’s to say the next vacuum won’t lead to the proliferation of Chinese-style authoritarianism?</p>
</blockquote><hr class="c-section-divider"><p>More mail ahead, with a different range of views. To respond very briefly:</p><ul><li>Thanks again for the erudition and tone of these letters;<br>
	   </li>
	<li>A lot of  the reaction is to the headline itself—“Wasn’t That Bad.” A minor point about headlines is that article-writers, including me, usually don’t write them and often have no idea what they’re going to be. (I think my idea for a headline was the one you see at the top of this item: “After the Fall.”)<br>
	The major point is that the editors who do write them are trying to present the main idea in way true enough to the subtleties of the piece—a few words, representing a few thousand words—to pass muster, but crisp and clever enough to entice the reader to spend time with the extended version of the case.</li>
</ul><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Often titles are intentionally overstated, with the idea that the reader will be in on the joke. (E.g. “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/10/why-i-hope-to-die-at-75/379329/">Why I Hope to Die at Age 75</a>.”) And these are often “thought-experiment” pieces, designed to explore a possibility rather than to make a definitive case.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">As with this piece: Everyone has heard the Decline and Fall version of the Roman saga. Not as many are familiar with another line from historians, saying “Now, wait a minute ….”  And if we talk about this other perspective, where might it lead?</p><ul><li>On the details of exactly how bad The Fall was, for which people, and where, and for how long, I promise to read  the Ward-Perkins book. I encourage these correspondents (and others) to read Walter Scheidel’s new book, which goes into very great detail on the economic and cultural indicators of “decline” and “recovery.”<br>
	    </li>
	<li>On the American side, as stated in this article and over the decades, I would prefer a functioning national government! But that is not in prospect right now. The purpose of this piece (like some others I’ve written over the years—like “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/07/countdown-to-a-meltdown/304041/">Countdown to a Meltdown</a>” or “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/10/bushs-lost-year/303507/">Declaring Victory</a>” [a headline I actually did write] or  “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/10/bushs-lost-year/303507/">Bush’s Lost Year</a>”) was to ask, <em>What if??? </em>More ahead on the ramifications of “What if,” in future installments.</li>
</ul><p>Thanks to these readers to engaging, and to them and others for considering, <em>what if?</em> More to come.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ourtowns">More from this series</a></p></div>

    <p>This dispatch is in the form of a newsletter update, on reactions from readers and significant developments around the country on the local-renewal fronts. It follows <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/07/the-rituals-of-becoming-america/593338/">this Fourth of July post</a>, about Eric Liu’s argument for a revival of “civic religion,” and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/07/when-small-towns-take-big-stage/593413/">this post</a> by Deb Fallows, on our increasing effort to connect, compare, combine, and in other ways “biggify” the multiple, dispersed examples of local renewal around the country.</p><p>Four entries in that direction:</p><p>1) “<em>Does America need a ‘civic religion’?</em>”: Eric Liu has long argued yes. <a href="https://www.mikelofgren.net/">Mike Lofgren</a>, a longtime veteran of congressional operations, writes in to say that he begs to differ:</p><blockquote>
<p>Does America need a civic religion?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>This subject, like the thesis that “Democrats need to talk about their faith” (I thought the Constitution banned religious tests for office), is a favorite chew-toy of centrist and left-of-center public intellectuals who fear the Republicans have stolen their clothes with all the flag-worship and similar ritualized razzmatazz. Apart from the tactical issue that the subject plays on the Right’s turf, there are fundamental objections.</p>

<p>Religion and modern democratic civil government do vastly different things. It is true that governing entities arose amid all manner of ritual, but they were hierarchical, and religion and state were the same thing.</p>

<p>Enforced ritual is essential to maintaining monarchies, class-based societies, and militaries. The Founders tried to dispense with a lot of the typical ritual of European monarchies for the new republic, such as addressing the president as Your Excellency; and Washington conspicuously wore no medals on his uniform coat.</p>

<p>There are more reasons, but I wanted to keep this brief.</p>
</blockquote><p>We’ll have more on this theme.</p><hr class="c-section-divider"><p>2) <em>Going home, to Jackson</em>. A reporter for <em><a href="https://mississippitoday.org/">Mississippi Today</a></em> named <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/author/lcampbell/">Larrison Campbell</a> has been in the national news this week. She has been covering a gubernatorial candidate named Robert Foster, who has now <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/11/politics/larrison-campbell-robert-foster-mississippi-cnntv/index.html">refused to let her ride</a> with him (unaccompanied) on a campaign swing, “out of precaution.” Precaution against—oh, it’s not worth even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/11/do-not-leave-me-alone-with-woman/">dignifying the claim </a>by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/03/30/pences-unwillingness-to-be-alone-with-a-woman-is-a-symptom-of-a-bigger-problem/">spelling it</a> out.</p><p>Although this has nothing to do with the central merits of Foster’s stance, it is worth mentioning that Campbell is openly gay and is married to a woman named Courtenay. Together they are raising two young children in Jackson.</p><p>Their home in Jackson is the reason I mention this development. Last year, for <em>Architectural Digest</em>, Larrison Campbell wrote a very nice essay on her decision to move from Los Angeles, where she had spent nearly two decades developing a successful media career, to Mississippi, where she grew up.</p><p>Her story is, of course, unique in its particulars, but familiar in its general themes to what Deb and I have heard in many places. Campbell’s whole article <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/why-i-moved-to-jackson-mississippi">is here</a>. Some samples:</p><blockquote>
<p>Sometimes you can be blinded by love or infatuation; friends probably thought we were [to go back to Mississippi]. But in L.A., no one’s direct enough to tell you you’re acting like a fool. Instead, half a dozen friends showed up at our going-away party with large bottles of vodka and bourbon “to help with the move.” Subtext: Adventures aren’t often easy …</p>

        <blockquote>
<p>Of course, Jackson has its faults. As I write this, we’re entering week two of a boil-water alert. But that doesn’t keep Jackson from being an intoxicatingly charming town. While other southern cities race to Brooklynize their downtowns with artisanal cheese shops and bespoke kitchenware stores, Jackson has remained resolutely Jackson. Yes, new places pop up, but Jackson’s best restaurants have been its best restaurants for decades …</p>

<p>There are signs that Jackson is recognizing its complex history. In December, the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum opened downtown. As the first state-sponsored civil rights museum in the country, the museum is unflinching in its presentation of history. It’s an immersive, often unsettling, experience, and one that alone is worth the trip to Jackson.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>Mississippi is … the seat of Christian conservatism but also the birthplace of rock ’n’ roll. It’s a state with a low graduation rate that continues to produce a record-breaking number of writers …<br><br>
It’s also a place that in 2016 passed “one of the most restrictive antigay laws in the country”—the same month it welcomed my family with more warmth and generosity than any city has ever offered …<br><br>
And … in 2017 the city elected—with 92 percent of the vote—a 34-year-old mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, on a platform of making Jackson “the most radical city on the planet.”</p>
</blockquote><p>To spell out what I found so resonant here (apart from the essay’s connection to the news of the day): One of the themes Deb and I continually rediscover is the powerful, enduring sense of <em>from-</em>ness in today’s America—the clear imprint of <em>place</em>, even in a country as mobile and homogeneous-seeming as modern America. People retain an awareness of where they grew up, as Larrison Campbell clearly did during her decades in L.A.— and as I have long done, as a person “from” small-town Inland Empire-California, despite decades based elsewhere. Some people <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/526872.North_Toward_Home">actually return</a> to those remembered places; many others at least think about it. This sensibility affects the way the country works, and how talent deploys itself city by city and state by state.</p><p>Another of those central themes, which this article clearly brings out: how <em>much</em> more varied and locally vivid “interior America” is than you would ever guess from the latest predictable political dispatch from “red-state America.”</p><hr class="c-section-divider"><p>3) <em>Local journalism watch:</em> Nothing matters more for the civic future of America than discovering a viable economic model for local journalism. Recently I <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/06/report-america-revives-possibilities-local-journalism/591817/">mentioned one step</a> in that direction, the new, fast-growing Report for America program.</p><p>Here is another small step: the announcement, reported by Sara Fischer <a href="https://www.axios.com/acronym-investment-dogwood-31891461-9f8c-474c-b94e-5bd7d113e077.html">in <em>Axios</em></a>, of support for a local news operation in Virginia, called <em>The Dogwood</em>. The $1 million investment is coming from <a href="https://www.anotheracronym.org/#theplaybook">Acronym</a>, a nonpartisan but politically progressive nonprofit group. In a statement about the investment, the CEO of Acronym, Tara McGowan, said:</p><blockquote>
<p>The steady decline of local news around the country, paired with the rise of misinformation being spread online has been alarming. It is our hope that digital newspapers like The Dogwood that deliver factual information and stories to people where they get their news can help fill that void and counter misinformation reaching them online.</p>
</blockquote><p>A $1 million investment obviously won’t fill the multibillion-dollar hole left by the collapse of local print- and broadcast-advertising budgets. Similarly: One more tree that is planted, or <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/12/bixby-ranch-dangermond-land-donation-in-california/548849/">habitat area</a> that is preserved, won’t address the full range of global sustainability crises. But you have to start somewhere, and it’s worth paying attention to those who are starting.</p><hr class="c-section-divider"><p>4) <em>Local arts watch: </em>Another $1 million investment, another start. A group called <a href="http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/">Souls Grown Deep</a>, which is based in Atlanta and whose mission is “promoting the work of African American artists from the South,” is committing the bulk of its $1 million endowment to local arts-related development and opportunity efforts in communities where those artists lived and worked. The project is in partnership with <a href="https://www.upstartco-lab.org/">Upstart Co-Lab</a>, a network of artists and social entrepreneurs. You can read the details of the project in this report by David Bank in<a href="https://impactalpha.com/souls-grown-deep-foundation-to-invest-1-million-in-artists-hometown-in-the-u-s-south/"> Impact Alpha</a>.</p><p>Next up, another report from the road. For now, congrats to all involved in these place-by-place efforts across the country.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ourtowns">More from this series</a></p></div>

    <p>Our two great American holidays are, of course, Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July.</p><p>They’re particularly American: Independence Day, for obvious reasons. Thanksgiving, because no one else observes it (other than Canadians, who have their own version on their own timetable), or can keep track of when it is. For Americans overseas it’s a particularly wonderful gathering day, on what the Brits or Koreans or French people around you assume is just another Thursday.</p><p>They have their rituals: In November, when it’s cold, we have the family gatherings, the pie and turkey, the stuporous sessions watching football or parades on TV. In July, when it’s hot, we have the picnics, the parades, the hot dogs, and the fireworks.</p>

        <p>And they’re hard to screw up: For Thanksgiving, the perils are the slog of jammed travel, and the likelihood of cranky relatives, or a turkey or pie that doesn’t turn out right. For the Fourth of July, it’s mainly the chance of rain, or mishaps with firecrackers (which, yes, genuinely scare dogs and cats), or children who become cranky by the time it’s dark enough for fireworks.</p><figure style="max-width: 672.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:59.375%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/IMG_20170704_120818/f724c7672.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">From the 2017 Palisades neighborhood parade along MacArthur Boulevard, riders from the United Horsemen’s Association.

Over the decades, this holiday has been one of the least politicized, most intentionally inclusive points on the city’s calendar. I lived in Washington for a year as a toddler, when my dad, then a Navy doctor, was stationed at the Bethesda Naval Hospital during the Korean War. Long ago I saw the old, now-lost home-movie clip from the 1950s, of me and my little sister running around on the National Mall on the Fourth of July, waiting for the fireworks. When we raised our own children in D.C., we loved every summer going to the Palisades neighborhood parade along MacArthur Boulevard, which grew longer every year with groups that reflect ever-broadening aspects of D.C. life.</p><figure style="max-width: 672.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:63.6904761905%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/IMG_20170704_114828/d5f92e89b.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">Dancers from Fraternidad Alma Boliviana, one of many dance troupes that traditionally march in the Palisades neighborhood parade.

Every Scout troop and local band or hobbyist group would send in a contingent. But national politicians kept far away, the president furthest of all. The Fourth of July was for celebrating America in its flawed-but-aspirational idealism, and in its campy, jokey, small-<em>d</em> democratic inclusiveness. The silly neighborhood parades are parts of the rituals that let us celebrate why we love the country, for all its failures, and what it can become.</p><hr class="c-section-divider"><p>This year that ritual, at least in Washington, is disrupted, in what we hope is an aberrational display. Apart from going to  neighborhood events today, and the evening celebrations, what is another way for Americans to reclaim, and renew, the rituals that reflect what Independence Day has long stood for?</p><p>I have a reading suggestion for today, or the long weekend. It’s a short book<em>, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/605353/become-america-by-eric-liu/9781632172570/">Become America</a></em>, by my longtime friend Eric Liu, who is a co-founder of <a href="https://www.citizenuniversity.us/">Citizen University</a> in Seattle.</p><p>Liu, who was born to immigrant Chinese parents in Poughkeepsie, New York, was trained as a lawyer and worked as a White House policy analyst and speechwriter. Through programs, events, and writings at Citizen University, he has over the past decade-plus advanced a theory and practice of modern citizenship, which is directly addressed against the despair and cynicism that are such natural reactions to today’s cruelties and crises.</p><figure style="max-width: 672.0px;"><picture style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:64.5833333333%;"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/IMG_20170704_120037/2aadfb11d.jpg" class="lazyload" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;"></picture><figcaption class="caption">Big-tent inclusiveness at the Palisades parade (with the “Yachtsmen for President” display)  (James Fallows / <em>The Atlantic</em>)</figcaption></figure><p><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" title="Click and drag to move" width="15" height="15"></p><p>The conceptually most important part of Liu’s new book is its forthright argument that active citizenship should be a <em>civic religion</em>. The book consists of 19 “sermons” that Liu has delivered at the institutions he calls “Civic Saturdays.” The big idea behind the sermons, and the religious-format gathering, is Liu’s call to a level of belief and commitment similar to that of a great religion—but where the underlying <em>faith</em> is in the process of democracy itself.</p><p>A  section from his preface lays out the concept clearly:</p><blockquote>
<p>Throughout 2016, Jená Cane and I kicked around ideas for a new civic ritual that would have the moral pull and communal feel of a faith gathering. We’re the cofounders of a nonprofit called Citizen University, whose mission is to foster a culture of powerful citizenship in the United States. (We’re also spouses!)</p>

<p>[After the 2016 election] we put together the first ever Civic Saturday … Civic Saturday has the arc of a faith gathering: we sing together, we turn to the strangers next to us and talk about a common question, we hear poetry and readings, there is a sermon that ties those texts to the issues and ethical choices of the times, and then we sing together again and reflect on what actions we commit to taking.</p>

<p>But this gathering is not about church or temple or mosque religion. It is about American <em>civic religion</em>: the creed of ideals stated at our nation’s founding and restated at junctures of crisis (like today), and the deeds by which we and those before us live up to the creed.</p>

<p>Why the analogy to faith gatherings? In part because over the millennia the major faiths have figured out something about how to help people find meaning and belonging, how to interpret texts and to reckon with the gap between our ideals and our reality, how to sustain hope and heart in a sea of cynicism and hate. And in part because we truly believe that democracy in America is an act of faith. Not faith in the divine but in the people with whom we hold the fate of this fragile experiment …</p>

<p>The idea that a religion is only as good as its effects can apply to American civic religion as well … [William] James at one point observes that war can summon in a people common purpose and self-sacrifice and ingenuity and he says a society needs the “moral equivalent of war.”</p>

<p>I say we need the moral equivalent of religion, and that is what civic religion is.</p>

As he says in one of his sermons:</p><blockquote>
<p>Democracy, when it’s working, is a game of infinite repeat play. It never ends! We believe that it’s necessary in the face of such unending uncertainty to provide a ritual structure for belief in the possibility of democracy.</p>

<p>Why do we deliberately echo the elements of a faith gathering? Because that language, those forms, these rituals and habits all resonate on a deep level …</p>

<p>In these darkest of days, in a time when politics is so fiercely polarized, when traditional religion fuels so much fundamentalist fanaticism, we want to appreciate anew the simple miracle of democratic citizenship …</p>

<p>This stuff matters not simply because it answers a universal and timeless yearning for shared purpose. It matters here because it locates us atomized, amnesiac Americans in the broad scheme of history and in a larger weave of morality. It matters because the norms and institutions of democracy are being corroded from within and without.</p>
</blockquote><p>Many of the sermons address specifics of how to convert a hazy concern about civic engagement to feasible to-do goals for the next day or week or year.</p><hr class="c-section-divider"><p>Go to your local parades.

        <hr class="c-section-divider"><p>This was what I told graduates from the Ursinus class of 2008, and pretty much what I would still say now. (I would change that era’s noun “IMs” to the current “texts,” but otherwise could leave most of the language intact.) The “President Strassburger” I mention in the opening line was John Strassburger, a wonderful man and the <a href="https://www.ursinusathletics.com/General/Strassburger">illustrious president</a> of Ursinus, who sadly <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/obituaries/20100923_John_R__Strassburger__Ursinus_College_president__dies_at_68.html">died two years later</a>, of cancer, at age 68.</p><blockquote>
<p>Commencement Address, Ursinus College, May 17, 2008</p>

<p>James M. Fallows</p>

<p></p>

<p>President Strassburger; honored guests; deans and faculty members; family and supporters; and above all members of the Ursinus College class of 2008 – congratulations. You’ve all worked, waited, and -- in your different ways -- sacrificed to make this day a reality. Speaking as the parent of two recent college graduates, I ask members of the Class please to turn and wave your recognition, and love, and thanks to the parents and other supporters who have stood behind you and are feeling boundless pride, and bittersweetness at seeing the adults you’ve become, and relief of several kinds at the step you’re taking now.</p>

<p>I’ve just done the first part of my job, in helping you notice this wonderful sunny day.</p>

<p>I’m about to do the second part, which is to be brief. Two days ago, I was in China, where I’ve lived for two years and was involved in news of the disastrous earthquake. Two days from now, I’ll be on my way back to Beijing. The reason I’m here today is a connection between your college and my family that stretches back 65 years. I’d like to tell that story and then say why I think it matters for you who are graduating today.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>In the summer of 1943, 65 years ago, James A. Fallows, my father, had just graduated from Jenkintown High School, not far from here. He was 18 years old – in fact, tomorrow will be his 83rd birthday, and I’ll join him in California to tell him about this event – and his country was at war. His older brother Bob was already in the Army. My dad’s main choices were to become a military pilot or a military doctor. The placement tests said Doctor, and so he came to Collegeville as an Ursinus pre-med student and Navy cadet, under the V-12 program.</p>

<p>His time here was rich, as yours probably has been. He was on the football and wrestling teams. He acted in plays. He sang in the Messiah chorus – impressive, since he can’t sing – and went to crack-of-dawn military drills when the bugle played Reveille on the campus. It was a different time.</p>

<p>The football team was successful, though they cheated, in a low-tech, pre-video way. He was a lineman, both offense and defense. He would wear a blue stocking on his right leg, and red on his left – and the man on either side of him on the line would do the reverse. The result was that linemen on the other team would look down and be puzzled, seeing a pair of blue or red legs that seemed to belong to two different people. When the ball was hiked, torsos and legs seemed to move in confusing directions. It helped Ursinus win, especially against academically less gifted teams. He liked it here.</p>

<p>But my dad’s time here, if rich, was brief. After two years at Ursinus, he had finished enough pre-med courses to qualify, by competitive exam, for Harvard Medical School, where he enrolled at age 20. He went from there to be a Navy doctor, then a small-town doctor, husband for more than 55 years to his childhood sweetheart from Jenkintown, father to four children, pillar of the small community in California where he raised his family. The finest man I know.</p>

<p>But because of the rushed wartime schedule, unlike today’s members of the class of ’08, my father never graduated from Ursinus. Until three years ago when the college, in a gesture that meant a tremendous amount to people now in their 80s, awarded its V-12 students their diplomas. I had hoped my dad could join us today, which he can’t – but I know that as you get your diplomas, he’ll be looking at his, mounted on his living room wall.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>I tell you this because I’m a proud son, as sons and daughters should be – but also because his time in Collegeville, compared with yours, helps me introduce three ideas I’d like to mention briefly. They have to do with the times you’ll live in and the traits you’ll show, and I think of them as: challenge; curiosity; and character.</p>

<p>We hear almost too often about the challenges that shaped my father’s generation – the grandparents of today’s graduates. They grew up during the Depression, the then they fought a long world war and cold war. As if that weren’t enough, then they had to raise the Baby Boomers, my own unpopular generation. Their times were tough – for instance, the life expectancy for an American man born in 1925, like my father, was only into his mid 50s—twenty years less than for someone born in 1986, like most of you.</p>

<p>Because of the way this “greatest generation” – your grandparents, my parents – met it challenges, we honor them, but I think we sometimes misunderstand what challenge can mean. We’re tempted to think that it takes extreme challenge to bring out the greatness in people – Pearl Harbor, 9/11 - and, correspondingly, that when times do really get tough people will automatically rise to their best.</p>

<p>I’m not sure about either assumption. Sometimes people and societies don’t in fact rise to meet their biggest tests – I fear our nation’s overall response to the challenges of 9/11 will be seen, in history, as falling into this category– and sometimes the real test of greatness in people and generations is coping with challenges that don’t take the obvious Pearl Harbor form.</p>

<p>This, I think is your generation’s chance for greatness. You already know some of the huge array of problem which, if they’re going to be solved at all, will require your minds and commitment and talent and self-sacrifice. Perhaps number one is preserving the global environment, and its range of species, and its climate system – every day in China I see reasons why that’s crucial and difficult. Every day in China I also see a billion-plus people struggling to condense a century of economic development into a few years. I don’t think they’re struggling to “take American jobs” or "threaten America’s place in the world” – they have too many problems of their own, as we’re reminded by the devastation there just this week. But they are changing your world.</p>

<p>I’m actually optimistic about your America’s prospects in dealing with China– and with India, and with the Middle East, and with questions of global harmony and domestic equality –as long as we newly embrace rather than stifle the traditional American virtues of openness, equality, innovation, and opportunity. And as long as you recognize the challenge to serve – not in the V-12 but in your era’s ways. Perhaps in the military, as a teacher, as a parent, as an entrepreneur, as volunteer. Sixty-five years from now, many of you will be back here, and you’ll want to hear that you were a greatest generation too.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>Second, curiosity. My dad always knew that he had been pulled out of Ursinus too soon. And that was a huge advantage. Having missed half of his normal college education, he gave himself ten educations in the ensuing years. He taught himself Greek, and then Hebrew, and polished up his Latin – and there were more. He became a painter, and sculptor, with his work in shows. He taught himself to sail, and play the piano, and to become a cowboy and head of local mounted police. He took up computers in his 50s and became a local webmaster. Now, at 83, he’s wondering whether to switch to the Mac.</p>

<p>He went overboard, because that’s who he is – but his is an extreme example of what a great college education should do for everyone. You’ve had a vastly better education than he had here, because you’ve had it in full and because Ursinus itself has is now so justly celebrated for the excellence of its life-changing undergraduate approach. You’ve shared an intellectual bond from Gilgamesh onward. But these years will have been wasted, Gilgamesh and all, if they’re not the beginning of a process of curiosity-driven self education that lasts the rest of your lives.</p>

<p>You can use your upcoming reunions as a handy benchmark. At each five-year interval – your 5th reunion, your 50th –be prepared to tell your classmates about the new thing you’ve recently learned. Guitar; Arabic; the tango; whatever. Here’s another benchmark: by the time of your 10th reunion, please spend at least one year overseas. There is no better way to learn about your own country than to see it from afar.</p>

<hr class="c-section-divider"><p>Third, character: Your parents know what I have learned from seeing my own children grow: that a lot of what we are as people, we are from the start. But we’re pushed to be the best versions of our inborn possibilities by parents in the beginning, then by teachers and mentors, and in the long run by ourselves.</p>

<p>Probably because he was so busy rushing through Ursinus, my dad – like another practical-minded Philadelphian, Benjamin Franklin – always emphasized that our character is the accumulation of things we actually do each day. In the end, we are our habits, so it’s worth developing good ones.</p>

<p>Some are obvious. Seriously, don’t smoke! Or, type IMs while you drive. Get in the habit of sports and exercise – by your tenth reunion, you’ll know who has and hasn’t. Get in the habit of being happy. We all have problems, which we can’t control; what we can control is how we look at them. Get in the habit of being excited. It’s a big world, with no excuse for being bored. It’s fun to have feuds and enemies – I’ve had my share– but break the habit of nursing grudges. Here’s a tip: always write angry letters to your enemies. Never mail them. Remember that anything hostile you say about people will get back to them. Especially if it’s in email.</p>

<p>Money: you’re going to have enough of it. Use the privilege of this education to know that you’re not going to starve, so you might as well spend your life doing something you love and are proud of. By your 20th reunion, and even more your 50th, you’ll see that satisfaction in work and family is scarcer – and far more rewarding – than the money race can ever be. Some people will always be better off than you, so don’t waste time envying them. Instead think of those you admire – and construct your own personal Mt. Rushmore, seeing what traits you can emulate.</p>

<p>Take every chance to tell your spouse, when you have one, and your children that you love them. When in doubt, phone your mom.</p>

<p>One final habit: Whenever you have the chance to deliver a sincere compliment, be sure to do it. My father is proud to be from Ursinus; I am proud of you; and we all are proud of you new graduates. These are sincere compliments, every one. Make the most of this wonderful day. #</p>

            <p class="dropcap">W<span class="smallcaps">hen the virus</span> came here, it found a country with serious underlying conditions, and it exploited them ruthlessly. Chronic ills—a corrupt political class, a sclerotic bureaucracy, a heartless economy, a divided and distracted public—had gone untreated for years. We had learned to live, uncomfortably, with the symptoms. It took the scale and intimacy of a pandemic to expose their severity—to shock Americans with the recognition that we are in the high-risk category.</p>

<p>The crisis demanded a response that was swift, rational, and collective. The United States reacted instead like Pakistan or Belarus—like a country with shoddy infrastructure and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/white-house-set-fail/607960/">a dysfunctional government</a> whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering. The administration squandered two irretrievable months to prepare. From the president came <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-coronavirus-threat/607825/">willful blindness, scapegoating, boasts, and lies</a>. From his mouthpieces, conspiracy theories and miracle cures. A few senators and corporate executives acted quickly—not to prevent the coming disaster, but to profit from it. When a government doctor tried to warn the public of the danger, the White House took the mic and politicized the message.</p>

Indeed, many have. One leader goes further still. Trusted by her people to navigate this outbreak’s murky waters, without inciting or succumbing to a pandemic of the mind, one politician is less a commander in chief and more a scientist in chief: Angela Merkel.</p>

<p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":248,"w":672,"h":264,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2520}'>For weeks now, Germany’s leader has deployed her characteristic rationality, coupled with an uncharacteristic sentimentality, to guide the country through what has thus far been a relatively successful battle against COVID-19. The pandemic is proving to be the crowning challenge for a politician whose leadership style has consistently been described as analytical, unemotional, and cautious. In her quest for social and economic stability during this outbreak, Merkel enjoys several advantages: a well-respected, coordinated system of scientific and medical expertise distributed across Germany; the hard-earned trust of the public; and the undeniable fact that steady and sensible leadership is suddenly back in style. With 30 years of political experience, and facing an enormous challenge that begs calm, reasoned thinking, Merkel is at peak performance modeling the humble credibility of a scientist at work. And it seems to be paying off, both politically and scientifically.</p>

A police officer, attempting to spread out the crowd, <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2020/3/23/21190803/carbone-crowds-nyc-delivery-takeout-coronavirus">reportedly said</a>, “I know you guys are just out here trying to make money. I personally don’t give a shit!” The poor got socially close, it seems, so that the rich could socially distance.</p>

<p>The past few weeks have exposed just how much a person’s risk of infection hinges on class. Though people of all incomes are at risk of being laid off, those who can work from home are at least less likely to get sick. The low-income workers who do still have jobs, meanwhile, are likely to be stuck in close quarters with other humans. For example, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/can-you-get-coronavirus-grocery-store/608659/">grocery-store clerks</a> face some of the greatest exposure to the coronavirus, aside from health-care workers. “Essential” businesses—grocery stores, pharmacies—are about the only places Americans are still permitted to go, and their cashiers stand less than an arm’s length from hundreds of people a day.</p>

            <p>At a tense moment in HBO’s <em>Chernobyl</em>, Soviet authorities discover that their robot technology is too primitive and faulty to clear ultra-radioactive rubble.</p>

<p>They could ask the Americans for help; the Americans have the machines they need. But such a request would further humiliate the Soviet state, already deeply shamed by the backwardness and incompetence revealed by the accident. Instead, the Soviets resort to “biorobots”—human beings. Teams of workers will hazard the radiation that disabled machines. To save itself, the regime will sacrifice its people.</p>

<p>I thought of that scene during President Donald Trump’s press conference Thursday about reopening the U.S. economy. The press conference lacked the drama of the HBO series. There was no single moment where the scheme was revealed in its enormity. Yet the intentions are becoming clear.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In January, the United States watched as the new coronavirus <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/01/china-quarantine-coronavirus/605455/">blazed through China</a> and reached American shores. In February, hindered by an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-have-been-tested-coronavirus/607597/">unexpected failure to roll out diagnostic tests</a> and an administration that had <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/05/white-house-loses-global-health-security-lead-as-a-new-ebola-outbreak-hits/560195/">denuded itself of scientific expertise</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-are-sick-lost-february/608521/">the nation sat largely idle</a> while the pandemic spread within its borders. In March, as the virus launched several simultaneous assaults on a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-forcing-american-hospitals-ration-care/609004/">perilously stretched-thin health-care system</a>, America finally sputtered into action, frantically closing offices, schools, and public spaces in a bid to cut off chains of transmission. Now, in April, as viral fevers surge through American hospitals and cabin fever grows in American homes, the U.S. has cemented itself as the new center of the pandemic—the country that should have been more prepared than any other, but that now has the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the world.</p>

            <p dir="ltr">As a homeschool mother, I’ve spent recent weeks giving pep talks to girlfriends. These friends tell me they’re spending their day troubleshooting lessons given over videochat. When they aren’t standing over their kids’ shoulders showing them which math problem to do, they’re printing their worksheets or scanning them to send back to the teacher. It’s exhausting for parents with one kid, but with three or four, it’s practically impossible. Many of these parents have told me they’ve ended the day in tears—or spent the entire day in tears.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The frustrations of these moms echo those of an Israeli mother of four who recently went viral in a screaming, pleading video to teachers, recorded in her car. She told the camera, “Listen. It’s not working … this distance-learning thing. It’s impossible!” She was “falling to pieces,” she said. “If we don’t die of corona, we’ll die of distance learning … Please. Turn it down. Foot off the gas. Leave them be.”</p>

<p>How many people have the coronavirus in the United States? More than two months into the country’s outbreak, this remains the most important question for its people, schools, hospitals, and businesses. It is also still among the hardest to answer. At least 630,000 people nationwide now have test-confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to <em>The Atlantic</em>’s COVID Tracking Project, a state-by-state tally conducted by more than 100 volunteers and experts. But an overwhelming body of evidence shows that this is an undercount.</p>

<p>Whenever U.S. cities have tested a subset of the general population, such as <a href="https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/14/coronavirus-boston-homeless-testing">homeless people</a> or <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2009316">pregnant women</a>, they have found at least some infected people who aren’t showing symptoms. And, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/theres-been-a-spike-in-people-dying-at-home-in-several-cities-that-suggests-coronavirus-deaths-are-higher-than-reported">as ProPublica first reported</a>, there has been a spike in the number of Americans dying at home across the country. Those people may die of COVID-19 without ever entering the medical system, meaning that they never get tested.</p>

<p>On November 8, 2017, Air Force One touched down in Beijing, marking the start of a state visit hosted by China’s president and Communist Party chairman, Xi Jinping. From my first day on the job as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, China had been a top priority. The country figured prominently in what President Barack Obama had identified for his successor as the biggest immediate problem the new administration would face—what to do about North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. But many other questions about the nature and future of the relationship between China and the United States had also emerged, reflecting China’s fundamentally different perception of the world.</p>

You probably believe it. According to <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/03/21/america-in-2050/">a survey from the Pew Research Center</a> last year, 60 percent of American adults think that three decades from now, the U.S. will be less powerful than it is today. Almost two-thirds say it will be even more divided politically. Fifty-nine percent think the environment will be degraded. Nearly three-quarters say that the gap between the haves and have-nots will be wider. A plurality expect the average family’s standard of living to have declined. Most of us, presumably, have recently become acutely aware of the danger of global plagues.</p>

            <p class="dropcap">W<span class="smallcaps">hen the virus</span> came here, it found a country with serious underlying conditions, and it exploited them ruthlessly. Chronic ills—a corrupt political class, a sclerotic bureaucracy, a heartless economy, a divided and distracted public—had gone untreated for years. We had learned to live, uncomfortably, with the symptoms. It took the scale and intimacy of a pandemic to expose their severity—to shock Americans with the recognition that we are in the high-risk category.</p>

<p>The crisis demanded a response that was swift, rational, and collective. The United States reacted instead like Pakistan or Belarus—like a country with shoddy infrastructure and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/white-house-set-fail/607960/">a dysfunctional government</a> whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering. The administration squandered two irretrievable months to prepare. From the president came <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-coronavirus-threat/607825/">willful blindness, scapegoating, boasts, and lies</a>. From his mouthpieces, conspiracy theories and miracle cures. A few senators and corporate executives acted quickly—not to prevent the coming disaster, but to profit from it. When a government doctor tried to warn the public of the danger, the White House took the mic and politicized the message.</p>

Indeed, many have. One leader goes further still. Trusted by her people to navigate this outbreak’s murky waters, without inciting or succumbing to a pandemic of the mind, one politician is less a commander in chief and more a scientist in chief: Angela Merkel.</p>

<p bis_size='{"x":75,"y":248,"w":672,"h":264,"abs_x":267,"abs_y":2520}'>For weeks now, Germany’s leader has deployed her characteristic rationality, coupled with an uncharacteristic sentimentality, to guide the country through what has thus far been a relatively successful battle against COVID-19. The pandemic is proving to be the crowning challenge for a politician whose leadership style has consistently been described as analytical, unemotional, and cautious. In her quest for social and economic stability during this outbreak, Merkel enjoys several advantages: a well-respected, coordinated system of scientific and medical expertise distributed across Germany; the hard-earned trust of the public; and the undeniable fact that steady and sensible leadership is suddenly back in style. With 30 years of political experience, and facing an enormous challenge that begs calm, reasoned thinking, Merkel is at peak performance modeling the humble credibility of a scientist at work. And it seems to be paying off, both politically and scientifically.</p>

I personally don’t give a shit!” The poor got socially close, it seems, so that the rich could socially distance.</p>

<p>The past few weeks have exposed just how much a person’s risk of infection hinges on class. Though people of all incomes are at risk of being laid off, those who can work from home are at least less likely to get sick. The low-income workers who do still have jobs, meanwhile, are likely to be stuck in close quarters with other humans. For example, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/can-you-get-coronavirus-grocery-store/608659/">grocery-store clerks</a> face some of the greatest exposure to the coronavirus, aside from health-care workers. “Essential” businesses—grocery stores, pharmacies—are about the only places Americans are still permitted to go, and their cashiers stand less than an arm’s length from hundreds of people a day.</p>

            <p>At a tense moment in HBO’s <em>Chernobyl</em>, Soviet authorities discover that their robot technology is too primitive and faulty to clear ultra-radioactive rubble.</p>

<p>They could ask the Americans for help; the Americans have the machines they need. But such a request would further humiliate the Soviet state, already deeply shamed by the backwardness and incompetence revealed by the accident. Instead, the Soviets resort to “biorobots”—human beings. Teams of workers will hazard the radiation that disabled machines. To save itself, the regime will sacrifice its people.</p>

<p>I thought of that scene during President Donald Trump’s press conference Thursday about reopening the U.S. economy. The press conference lacked the drama of the HBO series. There was no single moment where the scheme was revealed in its enormity. Yet the intentions are becoming clear.</p>

Now, in April, as viral fevers surge through American hospitals and cabin fever grows in American homes, the U.S. has cemented itself as the new center of the pandemic—the country that should have been more prepared than any other, but that now has the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the world.</p>

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p dir="ltr">As a homeschool mother, I’ve spent recent weeks giving pep talks to girlfriends. These friends tell me they’re spending their day troubleshooting lessons given over videochat. When they aren’t standing over their kids’ shoulders showing them which math problem to do, they’re printing their worksheets or scanning them to send back to the teacher. It’s exhausting for parents with one kid, but with three or four, it’s practically impossible. Many of these parents have told me they’ve ended the day in tears—or spent the entire day in tears.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The frustrations of these moms echo those of an Israeli mother of four who recently went viral in a screaming, pleading video to teachers, recorded in her car. She told the camera, “Listen. It’s not working … this distance-learning thing. It’s impossible!” She was “falling to pieces,” she said. “If we don’t die of corona, we’ll die of distance learning … Please. Turn it down. Foot off the gas. Leave them be.”</p>

<p>How many people have the coronavirus in the United States? More than two months into the country’s outbreak, this remains the most important question for its people, schools, hospitals, and businesses. It is also still among the hardest to answer. At least 630,000 people nationwide now have test-confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to <em>The Atlantic</em>’s COVID Tracking Project, a state-by-state tally conducted by more than 100 volunteers and experts. But an overwhelming body of evidence shows that this is an undercount.</p>

<p>Whenever U.S. cities have tested a subset of the general population, such as <a href="https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/14/coronavirus-boston-homeless-testing">homeless people</a> or <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2009316">pregnant women</a>, they have found at least some infected people who aren’t showing symptoms. And, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/theres-been-a-spike-in-people-dying-at-home-in-several-cities-that-suggests-coronavirus-deaths-are-higher-than-reported">as ProPublica first reported</a>, there has been a spike in the number of Americans dying at home across the country. Those people may die of COVID-19 without ever entering the medical system, meaning that they never get tested.</p>

            <h4>I. The Forbidden City</h4>

<p>On November 8, 2017, Air Force One touched down in Beijing, marking the start of a state visit hosted by China’s president and Communist Party chairman, Xi Jinping. From my first day on the job as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, China had been a top priority. The country figured prominently in what President Barack Obama had identified for his successor as the biggest immediate problem the new administration would face—what to do about North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. But many other questions about the nature and future of the relationship between China and the United States had also emerged, reflecting China’s fundamentally different perception of the world.</p>

You probably believe it. According to <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/03/21/america-in-2050/">a survey from the Pew Research Center</a> last year, 60 percent of American adults think that three decades from now, the U.S. will be less powerful than it is today. Almost two-thirds say it will be even more divided politically. Fifty-nine percent think the environment will be degraded. Nearly three-quarters say that the gap between the haves and have-nots will be wider. A plurality expect the average family’s standard of living to have declined. Most of us, presumably, have recently become acutely aware of the danger of global plagues.</p>
