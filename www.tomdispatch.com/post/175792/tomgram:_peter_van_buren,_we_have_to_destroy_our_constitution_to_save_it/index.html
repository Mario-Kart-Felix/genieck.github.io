											<p>A new book, as well as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/07/fbi-1971-burglary-hold-government-accountable">first account</a> written by a participant, remind us that, in the world of the national  security state, when it comes to pure and simple illegality in the  monitoring of, spying on, and surveillance of American citizens, there  really is nothing new under the sun.&nbsp; In a late-night break-in and theft  in March 1971, eight antiwar activists -- the Edward Snowdens of their  moment -- made off with the files of an obscure FBI office in Media,  Pennsylvania.&nbsp; These proved to contain documents incriminating the  Bureau for operations designed to breed paranoia in the anti-Vietnam War  movement and for what turned out to be illegal spying on Americans.</p>
<p>The activists, who remained anonymous and whom the FBI never found,  sent relevant documents to journalists.&nbsp; While some papers returned the  documents under FBI pressure, the <em>Washington Post </em>began  publishing pieces about them.&nbsp; In this way, in what was then still an  all-paper world, a distinctly non-digital, quite illegal break-in, an  act of conscience aimed at pulling back the curtain on government  illegality, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/us/burglars-who-took-on-fbi-abandon-shadows.html">began</a> the unraveling of a massive, secret counterintelligence, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a>, operation against Americans.&nbsp; It had targeted both the Civil Rights and antiwar movements, and involved the use of <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175718/gitlin_provocateurs"><em>agents provocateurs</em></a> and <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/08/02/fbi-director-hoover-s-dirty-files-excerpt-from-ronald-kessler-s-the-secrets-of-the-fbi.html">blackmail</a>,  among many other illegal acts.&nbsp; Without that break-in by the Media 8,  J. Edgar Hoover&rsquo;s &ldquo;shadow FBI,&rdquo; a criminal conspiracy at the heart of a  developing national security state, might never have been revealed.&nbsp;  (The CIA, officially banned from domestic spying on Americans, turned  out to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_CHAOS">involved</a> in massive surveillance as well.)</p>
<p>As a reporter at the <em>Washington Post</em>, Betty Medsger <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/fbi-media-burglary-solved-1971-165640272.html">received</a> some of the stolen documents and helped break the story back in 1971.&nbsp; Now, in her new book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307962954/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">The Burglary: The Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover&rsquo;s Secret FBI</a></em>, several of those involved in the Media 8 break-in have finally identified themselves. In her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/07/fbi-1971-burglary-hold-government-accountable">personal account</a> in the <em>Guardian</em>,  one of the eight, Bonnie Raines, writes this of her modern counterpart:  &ldquo;Snowden was in a position to reveal things that nobody could dispute.  He has performed a legitimate, necessary service. Unlike us, he revealed  his own identity, and as a result, he's sacrificed a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In our own time, despite Snowden, count on one thing: we undoubtedly  don&rsquo;t yet know the worst or most illegal aspects of this era of  &ldquo;intelligence.&rdquo;&nbsp; After all, while Snowden &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; up to 1.7 million  National Security Agency documents (many of them <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/snowden-still-holding-keys-to-the-kingdom/2013/12/18/b91d29a2-6761-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html">not yet</a> looked at, analyzed, or written about), there have been no similar  twenty-first-century break-ins at the FBI, the CIA, or other parts of  the American intelligence community (or for that matter at the Pentagon  and the Department of Homeland Security).&nbsp; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files">Massive</a> and <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175713/tomgram%3A_engelhardt,_you_are_our_secret/">shocking</a> as the NSA revelations have been, the curtain has only been pulled back  on a corner of the new Washington world that we, the people, continue  to fund, even if we aren't considered important enough to know anything  about it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the defenders of that world have been out in their  legions reassuring us that we need know no more, that it&rsquo;s all for our  own good, that NSA surveillance <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/claim-on-attacks-thwarted-by-nsa-spreads-despite-lack-of-evidence">stopped</a> untold terror plots, and that it&rsquo;s -- really and truly! -- not such a big deal.&nbsp; Former State Department whistleblower and <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175779/peter_van_buren_welcome_to_the_memory_hole">TomDispatch regular</a> Peter Van Buren begs to differ and so takes us through the labyrinth of  NSA defenses, point by point, showing just what our favorite  Constitution-shredders have to say and why it doesn&rsquo;t hold water.&nbsp;<em>Tom</em></p>

<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>You Can't Opt Out</strong> </span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>10 NSA Myths Debunked</strong> </span><br />By <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/authors/petervanburen">Peter Van Buren</a></p>
<p>The debate Edward Snowden envisioned when he revealed the extent of  National Security Agency (NSA) spying on Americans has taken a bad turn.  Instead of a careful examination of what the NSA does, the legality of  its actions, what risks it takes for what gains, and how effective the  agency has been in its stated mission of protecting Americans, we  increasingly have government officials or retired versions of the same  demanding -- quite literally -- Snowden&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131220/01032225646/nsa-defenders-ratchet-up-rhetoric-two-former-govt-officials-urge-hanging-ed-snowden.shtml">head</a> and engaging in the usual <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/30/revealed-nsa-pushed911askeysoundbitetojustifysurveillance.html">fear-mongering</a> over 9/11. They have been aided by a chorus of <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/355959/we-need-nsa-surveillance-gerald-walpin">pundits</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/snowden-still-holding-keys-to-the-kingdom/2013/12/18/b91d29a2-6761-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html">columnists</a>, and <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/lindsey-graham-nsa-tracking-phones-92330.html">present</a> as well as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-limit-the-nsas-effectiveness/2014/01/03/c876bdc8-73dc-11e3-9389-09ef9944065e_story.html">former</a> officials offering bumper-sticker slogans like "If you have nothing to  hide, you have nothing to fear," all the while claiming our freedom is  in direct conflict with our security.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to face these arguments directly. So here are ten myths about NSA surveillance that need debunking.<strong> </strong>Let's sort them out.</p>
<p><em>1) NSA surveillance is legal.</em></p>
<p>True, if perhaps you put &ldquo;legal&rdquo; in quotes. After all, so was slavery  once upon a time in the U.S. and apartheid in South Africa. Laws  represent what a government and sometimes perhaps even a majority of the  people want at a given point in time. They change and are changeable;  what once was a potential felony in Colorado is now a <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/colorado-pot-tours-grow-weed-article-1.1566673">tourist draw</a>.</p>
<p>Laws, manipulated for terrible ends, must be challenged when they  come into conflict with the fundamental principles and morals of a free  society. Laws created Nelson Mandela, the terrorist (whom the U.S. kept  on its <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/12/07/why-nelson-mandela-was-on-a-terrorism-watch-list-in-2008/">terror watch list</a> until 2008), and laws created Nelson Mandela, the president.</p>
</blockquote>
						<a name="more"></a>
						<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a catch in the issue of legality and the NSA. Few of us can know just what the law is. What happens to you if you shoplift from a store or murder someone in a bar fight? The consequences of such actions are clearly codified and you can look them up. Is it legal to park over there? The rules are on a sign posted right where you'd like to pull in. If a cop tickets you wrongly, you can go to court and use that sign to defend yourself. Yet almost all of the applicable &ldquo;law,&rdquo; when it comes to the National Security Agency and its surveillance practices, was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/17/nsa-spying-justification-declassified/">secret</a> until Edward Snowden began releasing his documents. Secret <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/fisa-court-has-been-radically-reinterpreting-privacy-law-secret%20">interpretations</a> of the shady Patriot Act made in a secret court applied. The fact that an unknown number of legal memos and interpretations of that secret law (themselves still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html?pagewanted=all">classified</a>) are operative means that we really don&rsquo;t know what is legal anymore.</p>
<p>The panel of experts appointed by President Obama to review the Snowden revelations and the NSA&rsquo;s actions had a peek into the issue of &ldquo;legality&rdquo; and promptly raised <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/192387819/NSA-review-board-s-report">serious questions</a> -- as did <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/01/07/dueling-rulings-over-government-phone-record-surveillance-stir-legal-ripples/">one of the two</a> federal courts that recently ruled on some aspects of the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2013/12/judge-pauley-to-the-nsa-go-big.html">issue</a>. If the Obama administration and the Justice Department really believe that all the NSA's activities will be proven legal in a court of law, why not allow them to be tested openly and unambiguously in public? After all, if you've done nothing illegal, then there&rsquo;s nothing to hide.</p>
<p>When Amnesty International first tried to bring such a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13987610465347808803&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">question</a> before the courts, the case was denied because that organization couldn&rsquo;t prove that it had been subject to monitoring -- that was a secret, of course! -- and so was denied standing even to bring the suit. Snowden's revelations seem to have changed all that. The documents made public have given &ldquo;standing&rdquo; to a staggering <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/hannity/2014/01/06/exclusive-rand-paul-file-lawsuit-against-nsa">array</a> of individuals, organizations, and countries. For the first time in 12 years, they pave the way for the issue to come to its proper venue in front of the Supremes. Openly. Publicly.</p>
<p><em>2) If I&rsquo;ve done nothing wrong, I have nothing to hide. So why should I care about any of this?</em></p>
<p>Keep in mind that the definition of "wrong" can quickly change. And if you don't know what the actual law really is, how can you say that you know you have done nothing wrong? If you've got nothing to hide, post your social security number and credit card information online, leave your curtains open at night, and see how that sits with you.</p>
<p>In a larger sense, however, the very idea that &ldquo;I've got nothing to hide&rdquo; is a distraction. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> guarantees a right to privacy. The Constitution does not ask if you want or need that right; it grants it to everyone, and demands that the government interfere with it only under specific circumstances.</p>
<p>The Fourth Amendment came into being because of the British use of general warrants in the colonial era. Under that &ldquo;law,&rdquo; they could legally search whole groups<strong> </strong>of people, their possessions, and their papers without having to justify searching any specific person. Called &ldquo;<a href="https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/att/generalwarrantsmemo.pdf">writs of assistance</a>,&rdquo; these general warrants allowed the King's agents to search anyone, anytime, regardless of whether they suspected that person of a crime. The writs were most often used by Royal Customs agents (an irony perhaps, given the draconian powers now granted to U.S. Customs agents to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2013/12/31/25dae296-7261-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html">search</a> anyone's personal electronics, including those of American citizens, at the border).</p>
<p>The U.S. fought a revolution, and James Madison wrote the Fourth Amendment, against broad government authority to search. Whether you personally do or do not have anything to hide is not even a question that should be on the table. It should be almost un-American to ask it.</p>
<p><em>3) But the media says the NSA only collects my "phone metadata," so I'm safe.</em></p>
<p>My older, conservative neighbor quickly insisted that collecting this metadata thing she had heard about on Fox was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-limit-the-nsas-effectiveness/2014/01/03/c876bdc8-73dc-11e3-9389-09ef9944065e_story.html">necessary</a> to protect her from all the terrorists out here in suburbia. She then vehemently disagreed that it was okay for President Obama to know whom she called and when, from where to where and for how long, or for him to know who those people called and when, and so forth.</p>
<p>Think of <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/06/10/prism_isn_t_the_scariest_part_of_the_nsa_revelations_phone_metadata">metadata</a> as the index to all the content the NSA can sweep up. That agency is able to record, say, 24 hours worth of Verizon phone calls. Its operatives can then easily locate any particular call within that huge chunk of metadata. Such basic information can also provide geo-location information to track physical movements. Metadata showing that you called your doctor, followed by metadata about which lab department she called next, followed by a trip to the pharmacy might fall into the &ldquo;something you want to hide&rdquo; category. (Actually, using metadata to learn about your medical history may not be even necessary. An&nbsp;<a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health/care/consumer/center/!ut/p/a1/hZDBToRADIafZQ8cpXUJCNxg1Q2wK8gawbmYAUYgwgwZJhjeXmDj0WyTJm3690v7A4EcCKdTW1PVCk67tSfW53N4iX3_3sPYjE0MzubRCa2XPR4eIIMQSN2JYhN_NEoNroYa_gxDKbhiXJVLMqkhEMnqhQr5OXi8qeWiYm0FeZYkrntK48QJ48PttWvFac8gH2Q70XK-GxVVrF8GkPlARPV0mbwV5PHCsOv1rC8mmdQbMSrIG0Y71cz6N21HJgcme8pXqC5kvXxLNkPQCF43Q46JhRjY0Vv07kQG4v5P8E94CENvz0Y3nVhaWKm32_0C8_F7zw!!/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/">exception</a> to the privacy policy of one of America's larger HMOs, Kaiser Permanente, states: "We may also disclose your PHI [personal health information] to authorized federal officials as necessary for national security and intelligence activities." BlueCross BlueShield has a similar exception as do <a href="http://www.bcbsnc.com/members/public/privacy/privacy.htm">regional</a> medical outfits.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0805096817/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><img src="http://www.tomdispatch.com/images/managed/meant.jpg" alt="" hspace="6" vspace="6" width="180" height="324" align="left" /></a>Metadata is important. Ever play the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">&ldquo;Six Degrees of Separation&rdquo;</a>? Silly as it seems, almost anyone is indeed just six hops away from anyone else. You know a guy in Detroit who has a friend in California who has a sister who cuts hair whose client is Kevin Bacon's high school classmate's cousin. You and that cousin are connected. Publicly available information tells us that the NSA traces <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/13/07/18/2023207/nsa-admits-searching-3-hops-from-suspects">&ldquo;three hops&rdquo;</a> from a target: A knows B, C, and D. But once C morphs into a target, C's three hops mean the NSA can poke into E, F, and G, and so forth. The <em>Guardian</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/28/nsa-files-decoded-hops">calculated</a> that if A has 50 friends, the number of targets generated under the three-hop rule would be over 1.3 million people. I really do hope that you (and everyone you know, and they know) have nothing to hide.</p>
<p><em>4) Aren&rsquo;t there are already checks and balances in our system to protect us against NSA overreach?</em></p>
<p>In recent years, the government has treated the king of all checks and balances, the Constitution, like a used Kleenex. The secret Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Court (FISA) was set up to provide judicial <a href="https://epic.org/privacy/terrorism/fisa/fisc.html">oversight</a> in a classified setting to the intelligence community.&nbsp; Theoretically, the government is required to make a compelling case for the issuance of orders authorizing electronic and other surveillance, physical searches, and compelled production of business records. Either the government is very good at making its case, or the court has become a rubber stamp: that secret FISA court approved all <a href="https://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/2012rept.pdf">1,789 requests</a> submitted to it in 2012.</p>
<p>The Patriot Act elevated a once rarely used tool, the National Security Letter (NSL), into the mainstream of government practice. National Security Letters are an extraordinary search procedure that gives the FBI the power to compel the disclosure of customer records held by banks, telephone companies, Internet service providers, public libraries, and others. These entities are prohibited, or "gagged," from telling anyone about their receipt of the NSL. Though the Justice Department itself cited <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/13/AR2008031302277.html">abuse</a> of the letters by the FBI in 2008, in 2012 the FBI used <a href="https://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/2012rept.pdf">15,229</a> National Security Letters to gather information on Americans. NSLs do not require judicial approval and the built-in gag orders prevent anyone from seeking judicial relief; indeed, most people will never even know that they were the subject of an NSL. And at the moment, the Department of Justice is trying to <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/06/justice-department-electronic-frontier-foundation-fisa-court-opinion?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+motherjones/main+(MotherJones.com+Main+Article+Feed)">keep classified</a> an 86-page court opinion that determined the government violated the spirit of federal surveillance laws and engaged in unconstitutional spying.</p>
<p>Director of National Intelligence James Clapper directly <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/06/12/how_james_clapper_will_get_away_with_perjury/">lied</a> to that check-and-balance branch of the government, Congress, in a public session. (He later termed his response the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/11/james-clapper-nsa-surveillance_n_3424620.html">least untruthful</a>&rdquo; answer.) And we wouldn&rsquo;t even know that he lied, or much of anything else about the NSA's surveillance activities here or globally, if it weren&rsquo;t for one man's courage in exposing them. The government had kept it all from us for 12 years and never showed the slightest sign of reconsidering any part of that policy. Without Snowden, we would not even know what needs checking and balancing.</p>
<p><em>5) But I </em><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57588234-38/obama-defends-secret-nsa-spy-program-trust-us/"><em>trust</em></a><em> Obama (Bush, the next president) on this.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I can guess what your opinions are of the people that run the Transportation Safety Administration or the Internal Revenue Service. On what basis, then, can you conclude that the NSA or any other part of the government is any more trustworthy or competent, or any less petty?</p>
<p>While the government does not trust you to know what it does, thanks again to the Snowden revelations, we know that the NSA trusts some foreign governments more than you. The NSA is already sharing at least some data about Americans with, at a minimum, <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/07/verizon-data-shared-with-u-k.html">British</a> intelligence and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/nsa-americans-personal-data-israel-documents">Israelis</a>. And who knows how those governments use it or whom they share it with downstream?</p>
<p>Do you really trust all of them all the time to never make mistakes or act on personal grudges or political biases? History is clear enough on what former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover did with the <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/13/j-edgar-hoover-and-the-fbi-s-war-on-americans-civil-liberties.html">personal information</a> he was able to collect on presidents, the Supreme Court, Congressional representatives, Martin Luther King, and others in the Civil Rights movement. Among other things, he used his secretly obtained information to out <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/13/j-edgar-hoover-and-the-fbi-s-war-on-americans-civil-liberties.html">gay members</a> of government. As for the NSA, so far it hasn&rsquo;t even been willing to <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/01/nsa-spying-congress-bernie-sanders">answer</a> the question of whether it&rsquo;s been spying on, surveilling, or gathering metadata on members of Congress.</p>
<p>Still, let's assume that Obama or the next president or the one after that will never do anything bad with your personal data. Once collected, however, that data potentially exists forever. If the NSA is to be believed, it claims to hold metadata for only five years, though it can keep copies of intercepted communications from or about U.S. citizens <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/20/nsa-data_n_3474820.html">indefinitely</a> if the material contains &ldquo;significant intelligence&rdquo; or &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; of crimes. The NSA can hold on to your <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/06/20/leaked-nsa-doc-says-it-can-collect-and-keep-your-encrypted-data-as-long-as-it-takes-to-crack-it/">encrypted</a> communications as long as is needed to break the encryption. The NSA can also keep <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/20/exhibit-b-nsa-procedures-document">indefinitely</a> any information gathered for &ldquo;cryptanalytic, traffic analysis, or signal exploitation purposes.&rdquo; Data held is available to whoever can access it in the future, using whatever technologies come to exist. Trusting anyone with such power is foolish. And as for data security, we know of at least one recent instance when more than 1.7 million highly-classified NSA documents just walked out the door.</p>
<p><em>6) But don't private companies like Facebook already have access to and share a lot of my</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-the-hidden-consequences-of-snowden/2014/01/05/ed0dda42-749d-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html"><em>personal data</em></a><em>? So what's wrong with the government having it, too?</em></p>
<p>While private companies can pass your private information to the government, either willingly or under secret compulsion, there still are some important differences.</p>
<p>At least in theory, it&rsquo;s your choice to give data to private companies. You could stop using Facebook, after all. You can&rsquo;t, however, opt out of the NSA. About the worst that Facebook and the others directly want is to take your money and send you spam. While certainly no angel, Facebook can&rsquo;t arrest you, put you on the No-Fly list with no recourse, seize your property or put you under investigation, audit your finances, imprison you without trial as a terrorist, or order you assassinated by drone. Facebook can't suspend your civil rights; the government can. That is a big, big difference.&nbsp; And by the way, a <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/07/31/2391511/deputy-nsa-metadata/">proposed solution</a> to the metadata collection problem -- having private companies, not the NSA, hold the data -- is no solution at all.&nbsp; Data stored and available to NSA analysts, wherever it is, is data stored and available to NSA analysts.</p>
<p><em>7) All this surveillance is distasteful and maybe even illegal, but isn&rsquo;t it necessary to keep us safe? Isn&rsquo;t it for our own good? Haven&rsquo;t times changed and shouldn&rsquo;t we acknowledge that?</em></p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a new argument; it&rsquo;s Old Reliable. It was the argument that Hoover, Senator Joseph McCarthy, and so many others made to justify the particular acts they chose to endorse to protect us against Communism. The 1976 <a href="http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/pdfs94th/94755_II.pdf">Church Committee Report</a>, the first and only large-scale review of America's internal spy networks, found that between 1953 and 1973 nearly a quarter of a million first-class letters were opened and photographed in the United States by the CIA. Like the NSA, it was at that time officially forbidden to spy on Americans <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/additional-publications/the-work-of-a-nation/items-of-interest/frequently-asked-questions.html#Spy">domestically</a>. It nonetheless produced a computerized index of nearly one and one-half million names. At least 130,000 first class letters were also opened and photographed by the FBI between 1940 and 1966, all to keep us safe and for our own good in changing times. I doubt many people now believe any of that is what kept the Reds at bay.</p>
<p>The same argument was made about the necessity of domestic surveillance during the Vietnam War. Again, from the Church Report, we learned that some 300,000 individuals were indexed in a CIA computer system and that separate files were created on approximately 7,200 Americans and more than 100 domestic groups under the umbrella of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_CHAOS">Operation MH/CHAOS</a>, designed to ferret out supposed foreign influence on the antiwar movement. Intelligence files on more than 11,000 individuals and groups were created by the Internal Revenue Service between 1969 and 1973 and tax investigations were started on the &ldquo;basis of political rather than tax criteria.&rdquo; I doubt many people now believe any of that is what kept the nation from descending into chaos.</p>
<p>The Constitution and the Bill of Rights have matured with our nation, growing to end slavery, enhance the rights of women, and do away with Jim Crow and other immoral laws. The United States survived two world wars, the Cold War, and innumerable challenges without a massive, all-inclusive destruction of civil rights. Any previous diversions -- Abraham Lincoln's <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/president-lincoln-suspends-the-writ-of-habeas-corpus-during-the-civil-war">suspension</a> of habeas corpus during the Civil War is a favorite instance cited -- were short, specific, and reversed or overturned. The Founders created the Bill of Rights to address, point-by-point, the abuses of power they experienced under an oppressive British government. (Look up the never-heard-from-again <a href="https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Third+Amendment">Third Amendment</a>.) A bunch of angry <em>jihadis</em>, real and imagined, seems a poor reason to change that system.</p>
<p><em>8) Terrorists are everywhere and dangerous.</em></p>
<p>From 1776 to 2001 the United States did not experience a terror attack anywhere close to the scale of 9/11; the worst terror attack against the United States as of 9/10, the Oklahoma City bombing, claimed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing">168</a> lives compared to some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">3,000</a> at the Twin Towers. Since 9/11 we have not had a comparable mass-scale terror attack. No dirty bombs at the Super Bowl, no biochemical nightmares, no suicide bombers in our shopping malls or theme parks. There have been only about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/21/american-gun-out-control-porter">20</a> domestic terror-related deaths since 9/11. Your chances as an American of being killed by a terrorist (the figures are for the world, not just inside the U.S.) are about <a href="https://reason.com/archives/2011/09/06/how-scared-of-terrorism-should">1 in 20 million</a>. The inevitable comparison shows the odds of being struck by lightning at 1 in 5.5 million.&nbsp; You are, in other words, about four times more likely to be struck by lightning than killed by a terrorist. Most of the &ldquo;terrorists&rdquo; arrested in this country post-9/11 have been tragicomic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/opinion/sunday/terrorist-plots-helped-along-by-the-fbi.html?pagewanted=all">fabrications</a> of the FBI. 9/11 was a one-off, an aberration, so unique that its &ldquo;success&rdquo; stunned even Osama bin Laden. It was a single morning of disaster and cannot be the justification for everything the government wishes to do forever after.</p>
<p><em>9) We've stayed safe. Doesn't that just prove all the government efforts have worked?</em></p>
<p>No, that's called false causality. There simply is no evidence that it's true, and much <a href="http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/20/21975158-nsa-program-stopped-no-terror-attacks-says-white-house-panel-member ">to the contrary</a>. It&rsquo;s the same as believing government efforts have prevented Martian attacks or wild lions in our bedrooms. For one thing, we already know that more NSA spying <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/30/opinion/bergen-nsa-surveillance-september-11/">would not</a> have stopped 9/11; most of the needed information was already held by the U.S. government and was simply not properly shared or acted upon. 9/11 was a policy failure, not a matter of too-little snooping. Today, however, it remains a straw-man justification for whatever the NSA wants to do, a way of scaring you into accepting anything from the desecration of the Fourth Amendment to taking off our shoes at airport security. But the government uses this argument endlessly to promote what it wants to do.&nbsp; Even the NSA's <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/30/revealed-nsa-pushed911askeysoundbitetojustifysurveillance.html">talking points</a> recommend their own people say: &ldquo;I much prefer to be here today explaining these programs, than explaining another 9/11 event that we were not able to prevent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, despite all this intrusion into our lives and the obvious violations of the Fourth Amendment, the system completely missed the Boston bombers, two of the dumbest, least sophisticated bro terrorists on the planet. Since 9/11, we have seen some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/21/american-gun-out-control-porter">364,000</a> deaths in our schools, workplaces, and homes caused by privately owned firearms, and none of the spying or surveillance identified any of the killers in advance.</p>
<p>Maybe we should simply stop thinking about all this surveillance as a matter of stopping terrorists and start thinking more about what it means to have a metastasized <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175713/tomgram%3A_engelhardt,_you_are_our_secret/">global surveillance system</a> aimed at spying on us all, using a fake argument about the need for <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175402/tomgram%3A_engelhardt,_the_100%25_doctrine_in_washington/">100%</a> security in return for ever more minimal privacy. So much has been justified in these years -- torture, indefinite detention, the Guantanamo penal colony, drone killings, wars, and the use of <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175790/tomgram%3A_nick_turse%2C_special_ops_goes_global/">Special Operations forces</a> as global assassination teams -- by some version of the so-called <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/06/06/why_the_nsa_needs_your_phone_calls">ticking time bomb</a> scenario. It&rsquo;s worth getting it through our heads: there has never been an actual ticking time bomb scenario. The bogeyman isn't real. There's no monster hiding under your bed.</p>
<p><em>10) But doesn&rsquo;t protecting America come first -- before anything?</em></p>
<p>What exactly are we protecting from what? If, instead of spending trillions of dollars on spying and domestic surveillance, we had spent that same money on repairing our infrastructure and improving our schools, wouldn't we now have a safer, stronger America? Remember that famously absurd Vietnam War <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%5Fn_Tre">quote</a> from an American officer talking about&nbsp; brutal attack on Ben Tre, "It became necessary to destroy the town to save it"? How can anyone say we are protecting our liberty and freedom by taking it away?</p>

	<p>You won't see segments about it on the nightly news or read about it on the front page of America&rsquo;s newspapers, but the Pentagon is fighting a new shadow war in Africa, helping to destabilize whole countries and preparing the ground for future blowback. Behind closed doors, U.S. officers now claim that "Africa is the battlefield of tomorrow, today." In Tomorrow's Battlefield, award-winning journalist and bestselling author Nick Turse exposes the shocking true story of the U.S. military&rsquo;s spreading secret wars in Africa.</p>

	<p>In 1964, a book entitled The Invisible Government shocked Americans with its revelations of a growing world of intelligence agencies playing fast and loose around the planet, a secret government lodged inside the one they knew that even the president didn't fully control. Almost half a century later, everything about that "invisible government" has grown vastly larger, more disturbing, and far more visible.</p>

	<p class="p1">At 73, having spent years focusing on the civilian toll from Washington&rsquo;s Afghan War, Ann Jones embedded on an American forward operating base to experience what that war was like for the U.S. troops in the field. The next year, she began following grievously wounded American soldiers from the moment they came off the battlefield all the way back home.&nbsp; Her journey proved to be nothing short of an odyssey. Despite all the talk in this country about our &ldquo;wounded warriors,&rdquo; no other book gives us a more powerful sense of the genuine cost of war to Americans.</p>
