to work for large insurance companies in northern California, assessing
property damage from fires and floods. But he was also a talented classical
violinist, and he would moonlight for different orchestras, which is how he came
to plumb a century-old mystery called the Enigma.</p><aside id="recirc-0" class="recirc-most-popular pull-right pull-small hide"></aside><p>In 2006, Padgett was
part of an orchestra preparing for a concert dedicated to the “mysteries and
hidden messages” of Edward Elgar’s <a href="https://youtu.be/SvA6FtN8-n0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Variations on an Original Theme, <i>Enigma</i>, Op. 36</a><span>. </span><span>The Enigma Variations,
as it is commonly called, is one of Britain’s most beloved classical music
works. Written between 1898 and 1899, it features 14 variations,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF4iLmuU_bM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one of which</a><span>&nbsp;has
become a kind of British national elegy, played at Princess Diana’s funeral and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlkpqjopFKQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">performed annually</a>&nbsp;<span>at the country’s Remembrance
Sunday ceremony for fallen soldiers.</span></p><p><span>When the Enigma Variations
debuted in London in 1899, Elgar wrote a mysterious note in the playbill:</span><br></p><blockquote><p><span>The Enigma I will not explain – its ‘dark saying’ must be left unguessed, and I warn you that the connexion between the Variations and the Theme is often of the slightest texture; further, through and over the whole set another and larger theme ‘goes’, but is not played …. So the principal Theme never appears, even as in some late dramas (…) the chief character is never on the stage.</span>﻿&nbsp;</p></blockquote><figure class="article-embed pull-right"><div class="video-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/rFgiPh6rZRs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></figure><p><span>So what is that enigmatic
theme that supposedly runs through the entire work but is never played? Elgar,
who died in 1934, never said. It has been understood to be a well-known melody
that would harmonize with the music if played along with it. For decades,
musicologists, cryptologists and music lovers have offered up innumerable
solutions for the phantom melody. In 1953, the </span><i>Saturday Review</i><span> magazine hosted a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1953feb28-00053" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">guessing contest</a><span>, eliciting suggestions
including a trio from Mozart’s opera </span><i>Cos</i><i>ì</i><i>
fan tutte</i><span> and a movement of Beethoven’s </span><i>Path</i><i>é</i><i>tique</i><span>
sonata. In 1960, English musicologist J. A. Westrup said it could be connected
to a passage from Bach’s </span><i>St Matthew
Passion. </i><span>In 1970, British musicologist and cryptologist Eric Sams argued
that </span><i>Auld Lang Syne</i><span> fit all 14
variations, even though Elgar himself had rejected that solution. In 1984, master
violinist and conductor Yehudi Menuhin&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/arts/music-notes-is-bach-the-clue-to-elgar-s-enigma.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">announced</a>&nbsp;<span>from
the stage at Carnegie Hall before conducting the Enigma Variations that the
solution was </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHNfvJc99YY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Rule Brittania</i></a><span>. In 1991, the </span><i>Sunday Telegraph</i><span> and the </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/07/arts/new-answer-to-a-riddle-wrapped-in-elgar-s-enigma-variations.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>New York Times</i></a><span> published British pianist Joseph Cooper’s solution: part
of the second movement of Mozart’s “Prague” Symphony, a theory endorsed by
leading Elgar expert Jerrold Northrop Moore. In 2007, the 150th anniversary of
Elgar’s birth, University of Leeds music professor Clive McClelland offered up a
</span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25434495?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">solution</a><span> to the Enigma: the 19</span><sup>th</sup><span>-century
hymn “Now the Day is Over.” “I suddenly came up with the first few notes of a
promising tune in bed at 4 a.m.,” McClelland </span><a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/404/elgars_enigma__new_solution_to_musical_mystery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">said</a><span> in a press release. “It
was a genuine ‘Eureka!’ moment!”</span></p></div></div><div class="full-width inserted-dfp ad-container-0"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><p><span>And
far from the ivory towers of music academia, mostly on his
blog, Elgar’s Enigma Theme Unmasked, Bob Padgett has emerged as perhaps the
most prolific and dogged of all Enigma seekers. His solution, which has caught
the attention of classical music scholars, lies at the bottom of a
rabbit hole of anagrams, cryptography, the poet Longfellow, the composer
Mendelssohn, the Shroud of Turin, and Jesus, all of which he believes he found
hiding in plain sight in the music.</span><br></p><hr class="section-break"><p>In 2009, during the global financial crisis, Padgett was laid off from
his insurance job.<b> </b>He moved his family to Plano, Texas, where his twin brother
lives. He began teaching violin and viola full time, and spent every free
moment trying to unwrap the enigma of the Enigma. I visited him this past August. </p><div class="inserted-housead"></div><p>Padgett, 47, is a meticulous man. He slicks his dark blond hair straight
back. He wears slender black gloves in the heat of the Texas sun to protect his
violin-playing fingers. He uses the proofreading software Grammarly to catch
typos and lazy vocabulary in his correspondence. He still recalls the fascination
that descended on him during orchestra rehearsals, when he learned some of the
backstory about the Variations. It sounded “kind of like a murder mystery or
something. Like, whodunit,” Padgett told me. “I thought this would be an
interesting puzzle to unravel.”</p><aside class="pullquote pull-right"><p>Far from the ivory towers of music academia, Bob Padgett has emerged as perhaps the most prolific and dogged of all Enigma seekers.&nbsp;</p></aside><p><span>Padgett said that the more he read
about Elgar, the more he noticed, as he put it on his&nbsp;</span><a href="http://enigmathemeunmasked.blogspot.co.il/2012/09/table-of-contents.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog</a><span>, “an astonishing
number of similar life experiences” between him and the composer. Like Padgett,
Elgar once made his living teaching violin. Elgar’s father was a piano tuner
who hated religion; Padgett’s father was an atheist plumber and trombonist.
Elgar’s mother was devoted to the arts and to God; Padgett’s mother was a
violinist who took him and his brother to Baptist church religiously. A young
Elgar tagged along as his dad tuned pianos and rehearsed in a local orchestra
in the English countryside; a young Padgett grew up in northern California
spending evenings at Monterey Symphony concerts in the front row, where his
mother kept an eye on him from the violin section on stage. Neither Elgar nor
Padgett studied music professionally. Padgett majored in psychology at Vassar,
and took counterpoint and composition classes for fun. He enrolled in law
school at Penn</span><span>—</span><span>Elgar had also studied law</span><span>—</span><span>but didn’t last a week.</span></p></div></div><div class="full-width inserted-dfp ad-container-0"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><p>Padgett composed music, too. In 2008, he won the Monterey Symphony’s
composition competition with his original work “Fanfare for the Eagles,” a
two-and-a-half minute showpiece packed with personal symbolism about the July
day in 1969 that Apollo 11 landed on the moon—the same day Padgett and his twin
brother were born, 11 minutes apart. The music began with an A-flat for (Neil) Armstrong,
a B-flat for Buzz (Aldrin), and a C-sharp for (Michael) Collins, the three
astronauts, and like Apollo 11’s lunar descent, the melodic line descended to
the 11<sup>th</sup> measure. Monterey Symphony music director Max
Bragado-Darman, who conducted the premiere of the piece, told the&nbsp;<i><a href="http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/entertainment/music/monterey-symphony-premieres-new-composition-that-aims-to-stir-listeners/article_10615aff-7b40-54b1-aa9e-7fe898d64ea5.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Monterey County Weekly</a>&nbsp;</i><span>that Padgett had “talent and genius.” It was a fleeting moment of fame
for the insurance benefits analyst from northern California. He entered four
more composition competitions, but didn’t win any of them.</span></p><p><span>The Variations had turned
Elgar, until then a small-town composer and violin teacher, into an
international sensation. Padgett hoped solving the riddle of Elgar’s work
could do much the same for himself. “I thought, well, if I crack the Enigma
Variations, something that nobody has been able to do successfully, that
perhaps I could be a candidate for an honorary degree, and that then would give
me some credibility,” Padgett told me.</span><br></p><p>He’d play a CD of the Enigma Variations over and again in his car, and
hum famous tunes to see if they’d fit. One of his first was “Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Star,” which was a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/14/vanessathorpe.theobserver" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">solution</a>&nbsp;<span>put
forth in a book by British Elgar enthusiast Patrick Turner. Padgett demonstrated
it for me as we drove to Whole Foods for breakfast. He played the opening of
the Enigma Variations on his car stereo, and hummed the nursery rhyme in a
minor key along with it. It sounded awful. “You can try and shoehorn it in, but
it doesn’t work,” he said. He experimented with “God Save the King,” “Rule
Britannia,” “Happy Birthday.” “I just tried out all these different tunes,” he
said, “to see if I could get them to fit. And none of them would. It was very
frustrating.”</span></p><figure class="article-embed pull-left"><div class="video-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/pG0xARoDlZw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></figure><p><span>One day, one of his favorite hymns popped into his head: Martin Luther’s
16th-century “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOm1_ta4rGI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ein feste Burg</a><span>,” German for “A Mighty Fortress.” He soon
dismissed it: The hymn was the anthem of the Protestant Reformation, and it
would have been an odd choice for a Roman Catholic composer like Elgar.</span></p></div></div><div class="full-width inserted-dfp ad-container-0"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><p><span>But he kept at it. His wife,
Heather, found him used library books about Elgar, and he pored over articles.
Following a thread in one scholar’s paper, he began to wonder if Elgar had
embedded hidden messages in his score that could lead him to the right answer.
So Padgett gave himself a crash course in cryptography, reading Simon Singh’s&nbsp;</span><i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Code-Book-Secrets-Behind-Codebreaking-ebook/dp/B004SOVC9W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Code Book</a></i><span>—</span><span>the version adapted for young readers. Following a tip from the book,</span><span> he set off
looking for anomalies in the Enigma Variations that he could grab onto to find
the mystery melody.</span><br></p><figure class="article-embed pull-right"><div class="video-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/R2f5wtCaDl4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></figure><p><span>He started with
one variation that is not like the others. Variation XIII features directly
quoted notes from Felix Mendelssohn’s concert overture </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I17oDiY3sM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Meeresstille
und glückliche Fahrt</i></a><span> (Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage), Op. 27</span>.</p><p><span>Padgett wondered:
Did Elgar quote Mendelssohn to hint that Mendelssohn himself had once quoted
the mystery melody? Then he thought: Did Mendelssohn ever quote any famous
tunes in his music? In fact, Mendelssohn
did, in a number of his works. One of them, his famous Reformation Symphony,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqdcnNYROLo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">features</a><span> the hymn “Ein feste Burg.”</span><br></p><p>In between music lessons, Padgett filled two notebooks with attempts to
find hidden codes in the music. He tried a substitution cipher, a classic
encryption technique, matching the opening musical notes of the Enigma
Variations to the letters M-A-R-T-I-N L-U-T-H-E-R, to see if any messages would
emerge. None did. He did the same with D-A-R-K S-A-Y-I-N-G, after Elgar’s
reference to a “dark saying.” That also led to a dead end. He even tried
translating the melody’s rhythm into Morse code.</p></div></div><div class="full-width inserted-dfp ad-container-0"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><p><span>Finally, he found what he
calls on his blog the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://enigmathemeunmasked.blogspot.co.il/2010/09/elgars-dark-saying-musical-checkerboard.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Music
Box Cipher</a><span>. I asked my father, who studied math and
music theory in college, to read through the blog post with me, and it took us
about an hour to understand it. Padgett noticed there were 24 notes in the main
Enigma melody, and 24 letters in the opening phrase of Luther’s hymn, “Ein
feste Burg ist unser Gott” (“A mighty fortress is our God”).&nbsp;</span><span class="m_-8259657765611528914gmail_msg">Looking for a connection between the&nbsp;two, he employed a code-breaking tactic called frequency analysis.&nbsp;</span><span class="m_-8259657765611528914gmail_msg">(Some
 have suggested the Enigma&nbsp;encryption device, used by the Nazis to relay
 secret messages during World&nbsp;War II, was named after Elgar’s Enigma 
Variations.)</span><span>&nbsp;In frequency analysis, a code
breaker identifies the most repeated letters and letter groupings in a coded
message, and substitutes them for the most common letters and letter groupings
in the language in which the code was written. Padgett counted the frequency of
letters in “Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott” (four E’s and T’s; two G’s, I’s,
N’s, R’s and U’s; and so on), and matched it with the number of times a
particular musical note in the Enigma melody was played with a note in the
Enigma’s harmony (four C/G pairs, two C/B-flat pairs). Using this method, he
translated the 24 note-pairs of the Enigma melody into letters. There were a
number of different possible combinations, mostly gibberish. One combination,
Padgett wrote in his blog, “Can only be described as breathtaking”:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>GSUS GRTS INOU BETR TENI FETE</span></p></blockquote><p><span>It’s an anagram of “Ein
feste Burg ist unser Gott.” In Padgett’s interpretation, GSUS GRTS is a
phonetic spelling for </span><i>Jesus Gratias</i><span>,
or “thanks be to Jesus,” mirroring “Deo Gratias,” a Latin phrase said during
Mass that Elgar’s wife once wrote in her diary. INOU BETR is a phonetic
spelling for “I know you better.” Five months before Elgar began writing the
Enigma Variations, a historic event took place that would have helped him know
Jesus better: The first photograph of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shroud of Turin</a><span>&nbsp;was produced, giving
Roman Catholic believers an opportunity to view the face of their savior. TENI,
Padgett says, recalls the Aramaic word “teni” used by Jesus in the New
Testament (biblical commentary written during Elgar’s time called “teni”
Aramaic, though it is Hebrew). Scrambled, it spells “nite,” as in “night.” Add
FETE, the phonetic spelling of “feat,” and the phrase is “night feat,”
recalling Elgar’s description of the Enigma as a “dark saying.” All together, a
hidden message in four languages — English, Latin, German, Aramaic — the first
letters of which spell out E-L-G-AR. “Such an incredible outcome could only be
the result of a deliberate, premeditated plan, one far beyond my limited powers
of invention,” Padgett wrote.</span></p><figure class="article-embed image-embed pull-right" contenteditable="false"><img src="//images.newrepublic.com/de403979235892d5d6fcdf8520ed5ef0e1de7345.jpeg?w=800" data-serialized="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;c7719f45-fd72-4a41-b55d-8d72385ddd3e&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;de403979235892d5d6fcdf8520ed5ef0e1de7345&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1801,&quot;height&quot;:1800,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;JPEG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/de403979235892d5d6fcdf8520ed5ef0e1de7345.jpeg&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}" width="800"><figcaption><span class="caption-text">Padgett has chased the answer to the Enigma for years.

detailed blog posts</a><span>, Padgett identified about
40 other clues that support his theory, weaving a confounding web of
musicological, literary, theological, and historical references. There are the
key signatures of the Enigma theme, G major and G minor, that feature only
three telltale accidentals, or notes played with flats or sharps: E, F and B —
the initials of “Ein feste Burg.” There’s the fact that Elgar finished writing
the music on February 19, 1899, but on the score erroneously wrote&nbsp;</span><a href="http://enigmathemeunmasked.blogspot.co.il/2012/03/elgars-dated-enigma-feb-18-1898.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">February
18</a><span>— the same day “Ein
feste Burg” composer Martin Luther died. And there’s the novel that Elgar gave
the conductor who premiered the Enigma Variations: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s
</span><i>Hyperion</i><span>, which </span><a href="https://books.google.co.il/books?id=hS8fAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;dq=hyperion+wadsworth+martin+luther&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XxdKtMXmMG&amp;sig=MAhMImFyryBzRAu2fYymyFCRU54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEtJ_Am73RAhXnO5oKHd5wA-YQ6AEILjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=hyperion%20wadsworth%20martin%20luther&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">quotes</a><span> the opening stanza of “Ein feste Burg.” “With that
book Elgar </span><i>literally </i><span>gave away the answer,” Padgett wrote.</span></p><p><span>If the Martin Luther hymn
is the missing tune, why did Elgar choose it? Padgett has that worked out, too.
The day before Elgar first played the Enigma theme for his wife, he said he was
considering composing a symphony to honor General Charles Gordon, the British
Army officer and war hero killed in the 1885 Battle of Khartoum by Muslim
forces after refusing to forsake Christianity for Islam. Gordon “simmereth
mighty pleasantly in my (brain) pan,” Elgar wrote the very day he debuted the
Enigma theme. Elgar, Padgett concluded, wanted to commemorate Gordon’s “mighty”
faith by choosing “A Mighty Fortress,” a war hymn that, throughout history, had
been sung by armies before battle.</span><br></p></div></div><div class="full-width inserted-dfp ad-container-0"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><figure class="article-embed image-embed pull-right" contenteditable="false"><img src="//images.newrepublic.com/d203b9bb6fa87f3027a10fd0708165e6b16623b0.jpeg?w=800" data-serialized="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d2578cc3-668f-4221-9ca3-a863873c86fd&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;d203b9bb6fa87f3027a10fd0708165e6b16623b0&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:3024,&quot;height&quot;:4032,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;JPEG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/d203b9bb6fa87f3027a10fd0708165e6b16623b0.jpeg&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}" width="800"><figcaption><span class="caption-text">Padgett’s notebooks contain nearly 200 pages of computations and notes that at times seem as mysterious as the Enigma itself.</span><span class="credit">Daniel Estrin</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>While Padgett taught an
afternoon violin lesson in the carpeted den of his modest apartment, I sat at a
table off to the side and thumbed through the notebooks he used to sketch out
his solution. Depending on your point of view, they resemble either the messy chalkboard
equations of a brilliant scientist, or the desk-drawer musings of a madman. A
matrix of musical notes and capital letters spills across the grid paper’s tiny
cells. Letters are written in red and blue. Some are circled in black or grouped
together in highlighter yellow. Others are connected by lines, like snakes and
ladders.</span></p><p><span>The solution came to him,
Padgett says, after he turned to God. “I remember reading the Book of Daniel,
and how Daniel was presented with an impossible puzzle,” Padgett told me. In
the Bible, King Nebuchadnezzar challenged the wise men of his kingdom to
decipher his dream without telling them what the dream was, much like Elgar’s
challenge to identify a theme that wasn’t even there. Daniel sought help from
God, who revealed the answer. So did Padgett.</span></p><p><span>“There were so many great
musicians who had come before me with far more talent and ability than I will
ever have, and they couldn’t figure it out,” Padgett said. “That’s when I had
to be humble and say, you know what? I need God’s help. That’s the </span><i>only</i><span>
way that I can figure this out.”</span></p><hr class="section-break"><p>Padgett’s theory of secret

battling the Tsarist regime in the 1880s – that a British newspaper article on
cryptography had deemed unsolvable. The solution involved a Polybius square,
the same classic cryptographic device Padgett believes Elgar used to encode the
string of letters in the Enigma theme—GSUS, INOU BETR, and so on. (Those
phonetic spellings, too, are characteristic of Elgar. He loved wordplay. In
letters to a friend in 1899, the same year he was working on his Enigma
Variations, he wrote the word <i>score</i> alternatively
as skore, skoughre, cszquórr, çkor and ssczowoughOHr.) One year before he began composing the Enigma
Variations, he sent his friend Dora Penny a coded letter of 87 squiggly
Arabesques.&nbsp;<span>Dubbed

The “Dorabella Cipher” was invented for an 1898 letter to his friend Dora Penny.</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Elgar did write codes into his music, he wouldn’t have been the first
to do so. Bach used a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_cryptogram" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">musical cryptogram</a><span>, in which musical notes stand for
letters, to encode his own four-letter name in his unfinished work </span><i>The Art of the Fugue</i><span>. Brahms and
Schumann encoded their names in their works, too. One British musicologist has
suggested Elgar musically encoded the names of people he disliked in </span><i>The Dream of Gerontius</i><span>, a work he
composed a year after finishing the Enigma Variations. And if Elgar’s Enigma
was indeed an actual musical counterpoint, and not just a concept, it wouldn’t
have been his first, either. Elgar loved composing harmonic counterpoints to
famous classical music works. When he was 12 years old, he wrote a counterpoint
to Handel’s “Messiah,” and sneaked it into the sheet music his father, who
owned a music shop, provided to a prominent choir. The year after Elgar completed
the Enigma Variations, he began writing his </span><i>Cockaigne
</i><span>overture, a section of which (about romantic couples) serves as a
counterpoint to the “Wedding March”</span><i> </i><span>from
Mendelssohn’s </span><i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i><span>.</span></p><p>All of which is to say that if anyone would have risen to the seemingly
impossible challenge of composing 30 minutes of complex and varied symphonic
harmonies and rhythms to fit one master counterpoint tune, while simultaneously
braiding in about 40 convoluted ciphers, and managing to make the whole thing
stir audiences to tears—it would have been Elgar.</p><hr class="section-break"><p>Julian Rushton, professor
emeritus of music at the University of Leeds, is one of the world’s foremost
Elgar experts, and he does not approve of the sleuthing approach to the
Variations. His 1999 book,&nbsp;<i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgar-Enigma-Variations-Cambridge-Handbooks/dp/052163637X" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elgar: Enigma Variations</a></i><span>, called recent research on ciphers “a postmodern mingling of
scientific positivism…with fantasy.” Based on the various clues Elgar offered
in his lifetime, Rushton laid out five criteria he believed must be met, and
had yet to be met, if an Enigma solution indeed exists. The solution must
reveal a “dark saying,” and must find “another and larger theme” which goes “over
the whole set” of variations, as Elgar noted in the program note of the
premiere. It must involve a “well-known” theme or piece of music, must explain why his
friend Dora Penny should have been able to guess it, as Elgar once quipped, and
must take into account a cryptic remark Elgar once made about a falling musical
interval in the Enigma theme. “I rather hoped these criteria would act as a
deterrent,” Rushton wrote in the </span><i>Elgar
Society Journal</i><span> ten years later. “Instead they have served a number of
would-be solvers to structure their arguments.”</span></p></div></div><div class="full-width inserted-dfp ad-container-0"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><p><span>Rushton was one of the
first scholars Padgett contacted when he arrived at his theory. He told Padgett
it was incompatible—not only the thought of a Roman Catholic composer picking a
Protestant anthem, but the hymn itself was a poor musical fit with the main
Enigma theme. “Ein feste Burg” seemed to work with the famous Nimrod movement,
but not with the most important section: the opening theme.</span></p><p>In 2015, after consulting an obscure set of notes Elgar wrote about the
Variations, Padgett believed he finally found the right counterpoint, the one
Elgar intended. It’s a mashup of the three famous renditions of the hymn: the 16th
century Martin Luther version, the 18th century Bach version, and the 19th
century Mendelssohn version. Played backwards. </p><p>Padgett made a&nbsp;recording&nbsp;of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXkr36Sm1jw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">composite hymn </a>played in reverse on top of the Enigma theme, and
put it on YouTube. To my ear, it sounds perfect. When I asked Rushton about it,
he said Padgett distorted the rhythm and mixed between the major and minor keys
to get it to harmonize. “Nice to have a good laugh occasionally,” Rushton wrote
me. “The backwards ‘Ein feste Burg’ shows that Mr Padgett is ingenious, if
nothing else, in pursuing his obsession.”</p><aside class="pullquote pull-right figure-active"><p>Many scholars think there is no hidden tune at all—that the Enigma was one of Elgar’s many practical jokes.</p></aside><p><span>Most Elgar scholars I contacted said they have stopped responding to
Padgett’s persistent inquiries. “I don’t have a lot of time for Mr. Padgett’s
theories, and our correspondence was less than amicable,” wrote Clive
McClelland, the music professor who published his own Enigma solution in the
prestigious </span><i>Musical Times</i><span> journal in
2007. One professor at the University of London, who asked for anonymity so
Padgett wouldn’t follow up, called Padgett’s theory an “attempt to create a
reality effect through the excessive presentation of material which the reader
is meant to assume is somehow evidence.” No composer, the professor added,
would have been mad enough to attempt the extraordinarily difficult
compositional acrobatics that Padgett suggests. In fact, many scholars think
there is no hidden tune at all—that the Enigma was one of Elgar’s many practical
jokes, or that the answer was a non-musical concept, like friendship, or the
loneliness of the artist, or even a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/746879" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">repressed homosexuality</a><span>. The Enigma, the
professor wrote in an email, is “endlessly fascinating—precisely because it’s
so resistant to a solution. There can be few hobbies that are so absorbing, and
so constantly generous in the time they offer to the hobbyist, than the pursuit
of a solution that doesn’t exist.”</span><br></p></div></div><div class="full-width inserted-dfp ad-container-0"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><p>Apart from the Enigma, Padgett has 
endorsed other theories that academics tend to reject. He supports 
creationism over evolutionary theory. He believes record high 
temperatures in the summer of 2015 were divine retribution for 
the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States. He shared a story on 
Facebook about an Ohio warehouse of fraudulent ballots filled out for 
Hillary Clinton before the presidential election, a story later debunked
 as fake news. In essence, Elgar scholars have dismissed Padgett’s 
Enigma theory as fake news, too.</p><p><span>On his blog, Padgett
accused Rushton of “intellectual blindness” and “academic malpractice” for questioning
the existence of an Enigma. He also contends that English scholars are too
protective of their prized composer to consider the theory of a layperson such
as him. “I’m an outsider, you know. I’m not one of these credentialed
academics. I’m not published,” he said. “Who am I to presume that I could
fathom the dark secrets of one of their foremost composers?”</span></p><hr class="section-break"><p><span>Shortly before I left Texas, Padgett turned the pages of his piano score to</span><b>&nbsp;</b><a href="https://youtu.be/zQVlBdE1A1U" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Variation XII</a><span>, my favorite, and began to play. There it was, the chest ache I
get whenever I hear that cello melody. (I played the Enigma Variations as a
cellist in a city youth orchestra when I was in high school.) It was an uncontrollable emotional trigger. I
drowned in it. It’s the way most people experience music. It moves you, even if
you don’t quite know how. It’s a language you understand, even if you don’t get
the grammar.</span><br></p><p><span>There is another way to experience music, and that is Padgett’s way: to
dissect it, to learn its grammar, and, ultimately, to borrow a phrase from the sequence
of coded letters he discovered, to know it better. For Padgett, who is very
religious, wrestling with Elgar’s work is akin to studying the Bible. It is
reassurance that a grand, intelligent design exists. “For him, it’s a religious
text,” his wife told me. “But he didn’t want to go on faith alone. He wanted
solid proof.”</span><br></p></div></div><div class="full-width inserted-dfp ad-container-0"></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><p>He’s still tinkering with his theory, looking for more hidden clues, editing
his blog, pestering scholars, trying to spread his gospel. I asked Padgett when
his pursuit will come to an end. “I think when the scholars can finally arrive
at a consensus and agree on a solution,” Padgett said. “But I’ll probably have
to wait till 2034.” </p><p>On the centennial of Elgar’s death, the&nbsp;<a href="http://elgarmuseum.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elgar Birthplace Museum</a>&nbsp;<span>in England, home to valuable Elgar archives, is set to open a mysterious
envelope given to the museum by donors. Some Enigma-seekers believe the solution
to the Enigma is in the envelope. (“It is certainly not about the Enigma
Variations,” the museum director told me when I called. He said it had to do
with sketches from another Elgar work, but wouldn’t elaborate.) Padgett told me
he fantasizes about the envelope being opened in 2034 and his proposed solution
being found inside, written in Elgar’s handwriting. But he doesn’t think that
will actually happen. More likely, he says, the composer sealed in the envelope
yet another coded message to crack.</span></p></div></div></div></div><footer class="article-footer-wrap" data-reactid="124"><div class="article-author-bio" data-reactid="125"><div class="bio-body" data-reactid="126"><div class="bio-text" data-reactid="127"><p>Daniel Estrin is a journalist based in Jerusalem.

But he was also a talented classical\nviolinist, and he would moonlight for different orchestras, which is how he came\nto plumb a century-old mystery called the Enigma.<\/p><p>In 2006, Padgett was\npart of an orchestra preparing for a concert dedicated to the \u201cmysteries and\nhidden messages\u201d of Edward Elgar\u2019s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SvA6FtN8-n0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Variations on an Original Theme, <i>Enigma<\/i>, Op. 36<\/a><span>. <\/span><span>The Enigma Variations,\nas it is commonly called, is one of Britain\u2019s most beloved classical music\nworks. Written between 1898 and 1899, it features 14 variations,&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF4iLmuU_bM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">one of which<\/a><span>&nbsp;has\nbecome a kind of British national elegy, played at Princess Diana\u2019s funeral and&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlkpqjopFKQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">performed annually<\/a>&nbsp;<span>at the country\u2019s Remembrance\nSunday ceremony for fallen soldiers.<\/span><\/p><p><span>When the Enigma Variations\ndebuted in London in 1899, Elgar wrote a mysterious note in the playbill:<\/span><br><\/p><blockquote><p><span>The Enigma I will not explain \u2013 its \u2018dark saying\u2019 must be left unguessed, and I warn you that the connexion between the Variations and the Theme is often of the slightest texture; further, through and over the whole set another and larger theme \u2018goes\u2019, but is not played \u2026. So the principal Theme never appears, even as in some late dramas (\u2026) the chief character is never on the stage.<\/span>\ufeff&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote><figure class=\"article-embed pull-right\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/rFgiPh6rZRs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div><\/figure><p><span>So what is that enigmatic\ntheme that supposedly runs through the entire work but is never played? Elgar,\nwho died in 1934, never said. It has been understood to be a well-known melody\nthat would harmonize with the music if played along with it. For decades,\nmusicologists, cryptologists and music lovers have offered up innumerable\nsolutions for the phantom melody. In 1953, the <\/span><i>Saturday Review<\/i><span> magazine hosted a&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1953feb28-00053\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">guessing contest<\/a><span>, eliciting suggestions\nincluding a trio from Mozart\u2019s opera <\/span><i>Cos<\/i><i>\u00ec<\/i><i>\nfan tutte<\/i><span> and a movement of Beethoven\u2019s <\/span><i>Path<\/i><i>\u00e9<\/i><i>tique<\/i><span>\nsonata. In 1960, English musicologist J. A.

In 2007, the 150th anniversary of\nElgar\u2019s birth, University of Leeds music professor Clive McClelland offered up a\n<\/span><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/25434495?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">solution<\/a><span> to the Enigma: the 19<\/span><sup>th<\/sup><span>-century\nhymn \u201cNow the Day is Over.\u201d \u201cI suddenly came up with the first few notes of a\npromising tune in bed at 4 a.m.,\u201d McClelland <\/span><a href=\"http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/404/elgars_enigma__new_solution_to_musical_mystery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said<\/a><span> in a press release. \u201cIt\nwas a genuine \u2018Eureka!\u2019 moment!\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span>And\nfar from the ivory towers of music academia, mostly on his\nblog, Elgar\u2019s Enigma Theme Unmasked, Bob Padgett has emerged as perhaps the\nmost prolific and dogged of all Enigma seekers. His solution, which has caught\nthe attention of classical music scholars, lies at the bottom of a\nrabbit hole of anagrams, cryptography, the poet Longfellow, the composer\nMendelssohn, the Shroud of Turin, and Jesus, all of which he believes he found\nhiding in plain sight in the music.<\/span><br><\/p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>In 2009, during the global financial crisis, Padgett was laid off from\nhis insurance job.<b> <\/b>He moved his family to Plano, Texas, where his twin brother\nlives. He began teaching violin and viola full time, and spent every free\nmoment trying to unwrap the enigma of the Enigma. I visited him this past August. <\/p><p>Padgett, 47, is a meticulous man. He slicks his dark blond hair straight\nback. He wears slender black gloves in the heat of the Texas sun to protect his\nviolin-playing fingers. He uses the proofreading software Grammarly to catch\ntypos and lazy vocabulary in his correspondence. He still recalls the fascination\nthat descended on him during orchestra rehearsals, when he learned some of the\nbackstory about the Variations. It sounded \u201ckind of like a murder mystery or\nsomething. Like, whodunit,\u201d Padgett told me. \u201cI thought this would be an\ninteresting puzzle to unravel.\u201d<\/p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\"><p>Far from the ivory towers of music academia, Bob Padgett has emerged as perhaps the most prolific and dogged of all Enigma seekers.&nbsp;<\/p><\/aside><p><span>Padgett said that the more he read\nabout Elgar, the more he noticed, as he put it on his&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http://enigmathemeunmasked.blogspot.co.il/2012/09/table-of-contents.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog<\/a><span>, \u201can astonishing\nnumber of similar life experiences\u201d between him and the composer. Like Padgett,\nElgar once made his living teaching violin. Elgar\u2019s father was a piano tuner\nwho hated religion; Padgett\u2019s father was an atheist plumber and trombonist.\nElgar\u2019s mother was devoted to the arts and to God; Padgett\u2019s mother was a\nviolinist who took him and his brother to Baptist church religiously. A young\nElgar tagged along as his dad tuned pianos and rehearsed in a local orchestra\nin the English countryside; a young Padgett grew up in northern California\nspending evenings at Monterey Symphony concerts in the front row, where his\nmother kept an eye on him from the violin section on stage.

In 2008, he won the Monterey Symphony\u2019s\ncomposition competition with his original work \u201cFanfare for the Eagles,\u201d a\ntwo-and-a-half minute showpiece packed with personal symbolism about the July\nday in 1969 that Apollo 11 landed on the moon\u2014the same day Padgett and his twin\nbrother were born, 11 minutes apart. The music began with an A-flat for (Neil) Armstrong,\na B-flat for Buzz (Aldrin), and a C-sharp for (Michael) Collins, the three\nastronauts, and like Apollo 11\u2019s lunar descent, the melodic line descended to\nthe 11<sup>th<\/sup> measure.

Padgett demonstrated\nit for me as we drove to Whole Foods for breakfast. He played the opening of\nthe Enigma Variations on his car stereo, and hummed the nursery rhyme in a\nminor key along with it. It sounded awful. \u201cYou can try and shoehorn it in, but\nit doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. He experimented with \u201cGod Save the King,\u201d \u201cRule\nBritannia,\u201d \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d \u201cI just tried out all these different tunes,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cto see if I could get them to fit.

None did. He did the same with D-A-R-K S-A-Y-I-N-G, after Elgar\u2019s\nreference to a \u201cdark saying.\u201d That also led to a dead end. He even tried\ntranslating the melody\u2019s rhythm into Morse code.<\/p><p><span>Finally, he found what he\ncalls on his blog the&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http://enigmathemeunmasked.blogspot.co.il/2010/09/elgars-dark-saying-musical-checkerboard.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Music\nBox Cipher<\/a><span>. I asked my father, who studied math and\nmusic theory in college, to read through the blog post with me, and it took us\nabout an hour to understand it. Padgett noticed there were 24 notes in the main\nEnigma melody, and 24 letters in the opening phrase of Luther\u2019s hymn, \u201cEin\nfeste Burg ist unser Gott\u201d (\u201cA mighty fortress is our God\u201d).&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"m_-8259657765611528914gmail_msg\">Looking for a connection between the&nbsp;two, he employed a code-breaking tactic called frequency analysis.&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"m_-8259657765611528914gmail_msg\">(Some\n have suggested the Enigma&nbsp;encryption device, used by the Nazis to relay\n secret messages during World&nbsp;War II, was named after Elgar\u2019s Enigma \nVariations.)<\/span><span>&nbsp;In frequency analysis, a code\nbreaker identifies the most repeated letters and letter groupings in a coded\nmessage, and substitutes them for the most common letters and letter groupings\nin the language in which the code was written. Padgett counted the frequency of\nletters in \u201cEin feste Burg ist unser Gott\u201d (four E\u2019s and T\u2019s; two G\u2019s, I\u2019s,\nN\u2019s, R\u2019s and U\u2019s; and so on), and matched it with the number of times a\nparticular musical note in the Enigma melody was played with a note in the\nEnigma\u2019s harmony (four C/G pairs, two C/B-flat pairs). Using this method, he\ntranslated the 24 note-pairs of the Enigma melody into letters. There were a\nnumber of different possible combinations, mostly gibberish. One combination,\nPadgett wrote in his blog, \u201cCan only be described as breathtaking\u201d:<\/span><\/p><blockquote><p><span>GSUS GRTS INOU BETR TENI FETE<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote><p><span>It\u2019s an anagram of \u201cEin\nfeste Burg ist unser Gott.\u201d In Padgett\u2019s interpretation, GSUS GRTS is a\nphonetic spelling for <\/span><i>Jesus Gratias<\/i><span>,\nor \u201cthanks be to Jesus,\u201d mirroring \u201cDeo Gratias,\u201d a Latin phrase said during\nMass that Elgar\u2019s wife once wrote in her diary. INOU BETR is a phonetic\nspelling for \u201cI know you better.\u201d Five months before Elgar began writing the\nEnigma Variations, a historic event took place that would have helped him know\nJesus better: The first photograph of the&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shroud of Turin<\/a><span>&nbsp;was produced, giving\nRoman Catholic believers an opportunity to view the face of their savior.

Gordon \u201csimmereth\nmighty pleasantly in my (brain) pan,\u201d Elgar wrote the very day he debuted the\nEnigma theme.

In fact, many scholars think\nthere is no hidden tune at all\u2014that the Enigma was one of Elgar\u2019s many practical\njokes, or that the answer was a non-musical concept, like friendship, or the\nloneliness of the artist, or even a&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/746879\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">repressed homosexuality<\/a><span>.

He also contends that English scholars are too\nprotective of their prized composer to consider the theory of a layperson such\nas him. \u201cI\u2019m an outsider, you know. I\u2019m not one of these credentialed\nacademics. I\u2019m not published,\u201d he said. \u201cWho am I to presume that I could\nfathom the dark secrets of one of their foremost composers?\u201d<\/span><\/p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p><span>Shortly before I left Texas, Padgett turned the pages of his piano score to<\/span><b>&nbsp;<\/b><a href=\"https://youtu.be/zQVlBdE1A1U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Variation XII<\/a><span>, my favorite, and began to play. There it was, the chest ache I\nget whenever I hear that cello melody. (I played the Enigma Variations as a\ncellist in a city youth orchestra when I was in high school.) It was an uncontrollable emotional trigger. I\ndrowned in it. It\u2019s the way most people experience music. It moves you, even if\nyou don\u2019t quite know how. It\u2019s a language you understand, even if you don\u2019t get\nthe grammar.<\/span><br><\/p><p><span>There is another way to experience music, and that is Padgett\u2019s way: to\ndissect it, to learn its grammar, and, ultimately, to borrow a phrase from the sequence\nof coded letters he discovered, to know it better. For Padgett, who is very\nreligious, wrestling with Elgar\u2019s work is akin to studying the Bible. It is\nreassurance that a grand, intelligent design exists. \u201cFor him, it\u2019s a religious\ntext,\u201d his wife told me. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t want to go on faith alone. He wanted\nsolid proof.\u201d<\/span><br><\/p><p>He\u2019s still tinkering with his theory, looking for more hidden clues, editing\nhis blog, pestering scholars, trying to spread his gospel. I asked Padgett when\nhis pursuit will come to an end. \u201cI think when the scholars can finally arrive\nat a consensus and agree on a solution,\u201d Padgett said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll probably have\nto wait till 2034.\u201d <\/p><p>On the centennial of Elgar\u2019s death, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://elgarmuseum.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elgar Birthplace Museum<\/a>&nbsp;<span>in England, home to valuable Elgar archives, is set to open a mysterious\nenvelope given to the museum by donors. Some Enigma-seekers believe the solution\nto the Enigma is in the envelope. (\u201cIt is certainly not about the Enigma\nVariations,\u201d the museum director told me when I called. He said it had to do\nwith sketches from another Elgar work, but wouldn\u2019t elaborate.) Padgett told me\nhe fantasizes about the envelope being opened in 2034 and his proposed solution\nbeing found inside, written in Elgar\u2019s handwriting. But he doesn\u2019t think that\nwill actually happen. More likely, he says, the composer sealed in the envelope\nyet another coded message to crack.<\/span><\/p>","deck":"Did a violin teacher from Plano, Texas solve the world's greatest classical music mystery?","bylines":null,"type":"LONGFORM","slug":"breaking-elgars-enigma","nid":139816,"url":"/article/139816/breaking-elgars-enigma","urlFull":"https://newrepublic.com/article/139816/breaking-elgars-enigma","status":"PUBLISHED","publishedAt":"2017-02-01T12:00:00.000Z","displayAt":null,"ledeImageCaption":"Photo Illustration with Hulton-Deutsch/Getty ","ampEnabled":true,"meta":{"wordCount":4224,"disableAds":true,"bigLede":1,"ledeOverrideSource":"<style>\n#article-139816 .article-cover {\n  display: none;\n}\n#header-139816 .header {\n  position: relative;\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n\n#header-139816 .rs img {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: auto\n}\n\n#header-139816 .fig {\n  width:100%;\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  z-index: 2;\n  opacity: 0.2;\n}\n\n#header-139816 .fig1 {\n  animation: header-139816-fig1 8s cubic-bezier(0.445, 0.050, 0.550, 0.950) infinite;\n}\n\n#header-139816 .fig2 {\n  animation: header-139816-fig2 10s cubic-bezier(0.445, 0.050, 0.550, 0.950) infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes header-139816-fig1 {\n  0% {\n    opacity: 0;\n    transform: scale(1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    opacity: 1;\n  }\n  100% {\n    opacity: 0;\n    transform: translate(-25px, 15px) scale(1.1);\n  }\n}\n@keyframes header-139816-fig2 {\n  0% {\n    opacity: 0;\n    transform: scale(1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    opacity: 1;\n  }\n  100% {\n    opacity: 0;\n    transform: scale(1.1);\n  }\n}\n<\/style>\n<div class=\"header\">\n  <div class=\"rs fig fig1\">\n    <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/9d3683f8e1bdbb7aefef3681bd5a1e565135932c.png\" />\n  <\/div>\n  <div class=\"rs fig fig2\">\n    <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/efaca15e267e94ebd99d29c997f455f1c084d41e.png\" />\n  <\/div>\n  <div class=\"rs\">\n    <img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/b9e2381ed242a855539fdcf2d43a651e969825d6.jpeg\" />\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo Illustration with Hulton-Deutsch/Getty <\/div>","hideLede":false,"hideHeader":false,"social":{"facebook":{"title":"Did a Violin Teacher From Plano, Texas Solve the World's Greatest Classical Music Mystery?","description":"For decades, musicologists, cryptologists and music lovers have searched for the phantom melody of Edward Elgar\u2019s \"Enigma Variations.\""},"twitter":{"title":"Did a Violin Teacher From Plano, Texas Solve the World's Greatest Classical Music Mystery?","description":"For decades, musicologists, cryptologists and music lovers have searched for the phantom melody of Edward Elgar\u2019s \"Enigma Variations.\""}}},"frontPage":null,"ledeAltImage":null,"sponsor":null,"galleries":[],"tags":[{"id":"0ed85d02-0da0-436f-841d-8ba0f5ed2062","label":"-recirc-suppress","slug":"recirc-suppress"},{"id":"d9089ebe-fb15-4d29-b138-334a3ff7ce4d","label":"-header-neutral","slug":"-header-neutral"},{"id":"f6bb3de2-0f7d-43e5-ae25-77b26a6603e0","label":"Culture","slug":"culture"},{"id":"aa87ee16-e396-4a37-ab87-a01ca9ec85b9","label":"Enigma variations","slug":"enigma-variations"},{"id":"54597a37-8e0c-471d-a238-ff748761f515","label":"classical music","slug":"classical-music"},{"id":"09b57e4a-1a0d-40b0-bc31-669097032b10","label":"edward elgar","slug":"edward-elgar"},{"id":"b1291e65-559b-4ce0-b74e-910bdd788f31","label":"coded messages","slug":"coded-messages"},{"id":"b60d6523-5cbd-4dd6-8696-edbeff1d798b","label":"cyrptography","slug":"cyrptography"},{"id":"370cff1a-31d7-428e-9ed2-547d8625f1ba","label":"-newsletter","slug":"newsletter"},{"id":"83809957-a9da-4aa4-8f07-b6b6401fd6e2","label":"-homepage-lower","slug":"-homepage-lower"}],"ledeImage":{"id":"5e7d5c52-dd69-4095-988b-f4a264d48163","hash":"2bfb41ddab02c4cab8eaff95b4ccf879c42c01b6","width":1400,"height":933,"format":"JPEG","isAnimated":false,"baseUrl":"//images.newrepublic.com/","src":"//images.newrepublic.com/2bfb41ddab02c4cab8eaff95b4ccf879c42c01b6.jpeg","meta":{}},"authors":[{"id":"655e4a0b-2565-478d-9276-0f5c8b42940c","slug":"daniel-estrin","name":"Daniel Estrin","title":null,"blurb":"<p>Daniel Estrin is a journalist based in Jerusalem.
