      <p dir=false data-test-bidi>Today we have Andrew Wilkinson (@awilkinson) of Tiny. Tiny is a holding company started by Andrew that buys “wonderful internet businesses” with the intention of holding them forever (akin to Berkshire Hathaway). Altogether, Tiny’s businesses do high 8-figures in revenue and employ close to 400 people across 20 companies. If you want to know more about his background, Andrew was interviewed on our podcast so give Episode #63 a listen. Today he answers: How do you find CEO&#39;s that you can trust, You&#39;ve mentioned Warren Buffet a lot, any other leaders you look up to?, Is “company building” a repeatable process? What % of it can be automated?, Can you recommend your favorite business books?, What is your biggest failure and what did you learn from it?, What is a core attribute you look for when you hire somebody?, How do you make connections with other entrepreneurs while residing in a non-startup centric city?, How much of your investments are made up of personal capital vs. OPM (Other People’s Money)?, During your time at MetaLab, what was the best way to acquire clients?, Are you taking Buffett&#39;s advice and reading 500 pages a day?, As a person, how have you evolved over the years?, How do you start a fund with money made from an agency?, What&#39;s the required mindset shift from running one business to delegating a team to run multiple?, If you internalize one principal into your kids, what would it be?, When you built your house, what are some things that could have made the frustrations easier?, Can I skip building an agency and go straight into investing? and What&#39;s the worst &amp; best advice you get from people who tell you how to become successful?.

Having guest on that allows you to dive deeper into thier specific expertise is interesting - more of that if possible<br />2. Looping back to previous trends and ideas from earlier episodes and reporting on what&#39;s changed may be insightful<br />3. A virtual live espisode where the audiance can submit questions/comments in real time may provide insight to topics/angles that resonate with the audiance that may have otherwised been breezed through<br /><br />Just a few thoughts.  Keep sharing, great stuff!</p>

And though it started as a “physical experience” (not going to call it a workout class) in-person in NYC, those who would like to join The Class digitally now have the ability to actually participate around the globe instead of needing to be there in-person. So... now anyone can actually discover what it’s all about.\n\nWe talk about her company, the genesis (the real version of the story), and also about “grieving well”... a phrase I'd never really heard of before or considered.\n\nWe talk about the principles behind The Class, the conversations she had in life right before it began, and a whole lot more.\n\nI'm really excited for you all, to listen to this episode with Taryn.

I look down empty streets, and it does feel that way sometimes as we struggle for perspective and control of the circumstance. But it dawned on me that, what’s surreal was the moments before all this, when we were under the delusion of control. This is real. Who knows how long it stays this real, how long before we are back under the illusion of control, but no matter the timeline, this is real. We’ve been shaken out of our surreal illusion, and we find ourselves here.\n\nYou cannot escape circumstance, but you can transcend it. For every leader, creator, thinker, and listener that has wanted to impact the world, now is your chance. Here is your opportunity. But it’s not just about finding and seizing opportunity, but instead, it's about subsuming responsibility.

A great Below the Line episode with him going into detail in reflecting on his entrepreneurial path. Today goes a little bit more into detail on one specific thing, and that's monetizing your creativity.\n\nNot only has Sahil monetized his own creativity, but he is also the founder of a company, a writer, and a painter. But his company actually powers the monetization of a countless number of creatives around the world. Whether they are creating art, making music, writing books, or wanting to pursue a side hustle.\n\nSahil tweeted about this recently, and that tweet thread is why I'm having him back on the show. He sent out a single tweet that went pretty viral that said: “I believe virtually everyone can make a living doing what they love. I discover new creators doing it in new ways almost every day. Do you want to create full-time but don't see a path towards doing it? Reply with what it is and let's see if I can help you outline a plan!”.\n\nA lot of people replied and a lot of patterns emerge from that single tweet that I'm excited to dive into with Sahil today. We covered the concept of exercising versus training, prolific versus perfect and setting realistic expectations and timelines. We also talked about being really public, really early. When he started to paint he actually created an Instagram @shlpaints before he even started to paint as a way to give people an insight into his path as a painter, and also as an accountability tool. We talked about why, when, and how to build an audience — and also about the time and dedication required to build the necessary skills and the audience that could provide potential financial freedom while pursuing one's craft.\n\nIf it's something that you set realistic expectations, and specific goals around then, in Sahil’s words, it's as easy as going to the gym three times a week for two years... He's never heard of that “not working for somebody,” and he thinks the same applies to anyone that wants to pursue a creative endeavor.\n\nSpeaking of creativity...

We talk about why it’s happening now and what climate + technology will look like 5-10 years from now.\n\nWe also talk about whether or not it be like CleanTech that came in 15 years ago and went away almost as soon as it arrived. What makes Climate Tech different?\n\nThey also share about their paths from passion to profession within this realm — and discussed the early days of people thinking, in Diego's case, that his idea was basically a nonprofit (and not a very fundable business). Or thinking that this space was too complicated and too big to try and tackle with a small team of dedicated founders.\n\nWe talk about all of these and more, and I'm really excited about this deep dive into this brand new space of climate tech.\n\nSpeaking of sustainable energy, Below The Line is brought to you by Magic Mind, the world's first productivity drink (and is our proud sponsor because it’s my own company).
