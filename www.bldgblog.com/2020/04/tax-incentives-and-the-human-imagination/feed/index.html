Thanks for remembering that old post.

I love your description of &lt;em&gt;Tales From The Loop&lt;/em&gt;, in your first comment, as looking “like a Scandinavian version of rural Ohio, because itself adapted from Stålenhag’s americanization of rural Sweden.” I’m often reminded—despite the man’s obvious political shortcomings—of Heidegger’s comment that “Americanism,” with all its gigantism and speed, was just a “concentrated rebound” of modern Europe, a kind of distorting mirror, or perhaps a shadow lengthened at sunset.]]></description>

found it! 

http://www.bldgblog.com/2007/12/the-future-warehouse-of-unwanted-books/

the passage I was trying to remember was this:

&quot;In other words, a relatively random piece of 100-year old legislation – dealing with copyright law, of all things – has begun to exhibit architectural effects.

These architectural effects include the production of huge warehouses in the damp commuter belts of outer London. These aren’t libraries, of course; they’re stockpiles. Text bunkers.&quot;

2007... wow.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is genuinely one of the most insightful pieces I&#039;ve read on the roots of human imagination (and on the entertainment industry in particular). 

It also loops back and ties into an old post of yours about the gigantic warehouses of unwanted books in rural Britain, where you wrote (I quote from memory, which means I&#039;m almost certainly paraphrasing) that that was an instance were &quot;laws create architecture&quot;--

I think what you&#039;re talking about in both pieces is the same pattern: the effects of one specific bureaucracy on architecture and environment in one, and, in the other (meta) level, its effects on our ability to imagine both environment and architecture.

In this sense it&#039;s also interesting to look at the recent Tales from the Loop, a (mostly static) nostalgic ride around mid-70s Americana, which looks like a Scandinavian version of rural Ohio, because itself adapted from Stålenhag&#039;s americanization of rural Sweden. How many layers are there? And how much of it is based on what American movies Stålenhag grew up with?]]></description>
