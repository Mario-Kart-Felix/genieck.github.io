										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lensing.jpeg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: An example of gravitational lens effects, via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens"><em>Wikipedia</em></a>.]</small></p>
<p>Over at <em>WIRED</em>, Daniel Oberhaus, author of the recent book <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/extraterrestrial-languages/9780262043069"><em>Extraterrestrial Languages</em></a>, takes a look at some proposals from NASA’s Innovative Advanced Concept (NIAC) program. “Among this year’s NIAC grants,” Oberhaus writes, “are proposals to turn a lunar crater into a giant radio dish, to develop an antimatter deceleration system, and to map the inside of an asteroid. But the most eye-popping concept of the bunch was advanced by Slava Turyshev, a physicist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who wants to photograph an exoplanet by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nasa-wants-to-photograph-the-surface-of-an-exoplanet/">using the sun as a giant camera lens</a>.”</p>
<p>There is much more specific information in Oberhaus’s piece—about gravitational lensing, etc. etc.—but the following detail is killer. “Unlike a camera lens,” we read, “the sun doesn’t have a single focal point, but a focal line that starts around 50 billion miles away and extends infinitely into space. The image of an exoplanet can be imagined as a tube less than a mile in diameter centered on this focal line and located 60 billion miles away in the vast emptiness of interstellar space. The telescope must align itself perfectly within this tube so that you could draw an imaginary line from the center of the telescope through the center of the sun to a region on the exoplanet.” </p>
<p>Cameras in space, waiting to be discovered—or where astronomy and cinematography become the same pursuit. </p>
<p>Seen this way, the solar system is more like a maze of optical effects, a topology of entangled image-tubes and horizon lines, of gravitational mirages streamed from one side of the galaxy to the next, torqued, lensed, and ribboned into geometric shapes we then struggle to unknot with the right billion-dollar instrumentation. </p>
<p>Along those lines, recall this <a href="https://xenogothic.com/2019/04/10/the-void-image-notes-on-the-event-horizon-telescope/">excellent post on <em>Xenogothic</em></a> following last year’s unprecedented “photo” taken of a black hole. According to <em>Xenogothic</em>, this curious anti-photo depicting the absence of light reveals “the true, formless nature of photography and our photographies-to-come&#8230; The further out into the imperceptible universe we reach, the quicker we must get used to seeing images which are ostensibly not-for-us.” Imaging black holes is art history by other means. </p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blackholesun.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Black hole, via <a href="https://xenogothic.com/2019/04/10/the-void-image-notes-on-the-event-horizon-telescope/"><em>Xenogothic</em></a>.]</small></p>
<p>In fact, all of this reminds me of one of my favorite museums in the world, the <a href="http://www.museocinema.it/en">National Museum of Cinema</a> in Turin, Italy, which begins its history of cinema with a display of circular mirrors, anamorphic paintings, perspectival diagrams, and other optical tricks that, in the proper historical context, seem indistinguishable from magic. The birth of “cinema,” we might say, occurred when someone distorted light with mirrors; its origins are rooted in illusion and reflection, not projection and electricity.</p>
<p>In any case, imagine magicians of the near-future, performing for audiences aboard relativistic spacecraft, making stars disappear by manipulating image-tubes in the voids between planets. Gravitational lensing will pass from a niche science into popular spectacle. </p>
<p>And then, of course—the inevitable next step in a Christopher Priest novel—these magical effects of stellar camouflage, <em>Xenogothic</em>’s “photographies-to-come,” will become weaponized, militarized, transformed into tools for catastrophically redirecting light through space and extinguishing distant worlds. </p>
<p>From an optical effect in the prehistory of cinema to relativistic gravitational lensing in the abstracts of NASA to future galactic conquerors casually folding closed their image-tubes and making entire planets disappear.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/casparfriedrice.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderer_above_the_Sea_of_Fog"><em>Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer</em></a> by Caspar David Friedrich (c. 1818).]</small></p>
<p>It would be interesting to look at locations of the American popular imagination, as seen in movies and TV, mapped against regional tax breaks for the film industry. </p>
<p>There was a brief span of time, for example, when rural Pennsylvania stood in for <em>authentic Americana</em>, a kind of Rust Belt imaginary, all pick-up trucks and hard-drinking younger brothers, stories framed against the hulking ruins of industrial landscapes—I’m thinking of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_Furnace"><em>Out Of The Furnace</em></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_(2013_film)"><em>Prisoners</em></a>, both released in 2013, or even 2010’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstoppable_(2010_film)"><em>Unstoppable</em></a>. Whereas, today, Georgia seems to have stepped into that niche, between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsider_(miniseries)"><em>The Outsider</em></a> and, say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindhunter_(TV_series)"><em>Mindhunter</em></a> (season two), let alone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_(TV_series)"><em>Atlanta</em></a>, no doubt precisely because Georgia has <a href="https://variety.com/2018/film/features/georgias-production-incentives-seal-the-deal-for-hollywood-1202990450/">well-known tax incentives</a> in place for filming. </p>
<p>My point is that an entire generation of people—not just Americans, but film viewers and coronavirus quarantine streamers and TV binge-watchers around the world—might have their imaginative landscapes shaped not by immaterial forces, by symbolic archetypes or universal rules bubbling up from the high-pressure depths of human psychology, but instead by tax breaks offered in particular U.S. states at particular moments in American history. </p>
<p>You grow up thinking about Gothic pine forests, or you fall asleep at night with visions of rain-soaked Georgia parking lots crowding your head, but it’s not just because of the aesthetic or atmospheric appeal of those landscapes; it’s because those landscapes are, in effect, receiving imaginative subsidies from local business bureaus. You’re dreaming of them for a reason.</p>
<p>Your mind is not immaterial, in other words, some angelic force waltzing across the surface of the world, stopping now and again to dwell on universal imagery, but something deeply mundane, something sculpted by ridiculous things, like whether or not camera crews in a given state get hotel room discounts for productions lasting more than two weeks.</p>
<p>Of course, you could extend a similar kind of analysis way back into art history and look at, say, the opening of particular landscapes in western Europe, after decades of war, suddenly made safe for cultured travelers such as Caspar David Friedrich, whose paintings later came to define an entire era of European and European-descended male imaginations. That <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderer_above_the_Sea_of_Fog">wanderer over a sea of fog</a>, in other words, was wandering through a very specific landscape during a very particular window of European political accessibility. Had things been different, had history taken a slightly different path, Friedrich might have been stuck in his parents’ house, painting still-lives and weed-choked alleyways, and who knows what images today’s solo hikers might be daydreaming about instead.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/outsider.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: From <a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-outsider"><em>The Outsider</em></a>, courtesy <a href="https://www.hbo.com/">HBO</a>; I should mention that <em>The Outsider</em> was set and filmed primarily in Georgia, a departure from Stephen King’s novel, which was primarily set in Oklahoma.]</small></p>
<p>In any case, the humid forests of rural America, the looming water towers and abandoned industrial facilities, the kudzu-covered strip malls and furloughed police stations—picture the Louisianan expanses of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective"><em>True Detective</em></a> (season one)—have come to represent the dark narrative potential of the contemporary world. But what if, say, North Dakota or Manitoba (where, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grudge_(2020_film)"><em>The Grudge</em></a> was recently filmed) had offered better tax breaks? </p>
<p>My own childhood imagination was a world of sunlit suburbs, detached single-family homes, and long-shadowed neighborhood secrets, but, as to my larger point here, I also grew up watching movies like <em>E.T.</em>, <em>Poltergeist</em>, <em>Fright Night</em>, and <em>Blue Velvet</em>—so, in a sense, <em>of course</em> I would think that’s what the world looked like. </p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bluevelveeta.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: From David Lynch’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Velvet_(film)"><em>Blue Velvet</em></a> (1986), specifically via the site <a href="https://velveteyes.net/movie-stills/blue-velvet/">Velvet Eyes</a>.]</small></p>
<p>So, again, it would be interesting to explore how one’s vision of the world—your most fundamental imagination of the cosmos—is being shaped for you by tax breaks, film incentives, and other, utterly trivial local concerns, like whether or not out-of-state catering companies can get refunds on expenditures over a certain amount or where actors can write off per diems as gifts, not income, affecting whether crime films or horror stories will be shot there, and thus where an entire generation’s future nightmares might be set. </p>
<p>Or, for that matter, you could look at when particular colors, paints, and pigments became affordable for artists of a certain era, resulting in all those dark and moody images you love to stare at in the local museum—e.g. the old joke that, at some point, Rembrandt simply bought too much purple. It wasn’t promethean inspiration; it was material surplus.</p>
<p>We see things for a reason, yet, over and over again, mistake our dreams for signs of the cosmic. Or, to put this another way, we are not surrounded by mythology; we are surrounded by economics. The latter is a superb and confusing mimic.</p>

<p>This story, from July 1988, feels unexpectedly timely today, given our new era of experimental sci-fi building materials, from mushroom bricks to translucent wood. </p>
<p>“Two brothers were convicted by a federal jury Thursday on charges that they organized an elaborate hoax in which they duped investors of $3 million with claims that they had found a way to transform common weeds into ‘Space Age’ synthetic building materials,” the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-07-22-me-7666-story.html"><em>L.A. Times</em></a> reported. “They gave the products names, including ‘Impervium’ and ‘Impervicon,’ and at one time peddled them on the ‘700 Club,’ an evangelical television program, according to the charges.”</p>
<p>This would make a great premise for a short story or novel, for what it’s worth.</p>

<p>As part of some early prep, just putting notes together for a workshop I’ll be leading in Moscow later this summer, I thought I’d link back to this 2014 post by Paul Gilster on <em>Centauri Dreams</em> about “<a href="https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2014/02/12/seti-at-the-particle-level/">SETI at the Particle Level</a>”—that is, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence reimagined on radically different spatial scales than what humans have previously looked for. </p>
<p>“To find the truly advanced civilizations, we would need to look on the level of the very small,” Gilster suggests. We perhaps even need to look at the scale of individual particles.</p>
<p>“If SETI is giving us no evidence of extraterrestrials,” <a href="https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2014/02/12/seti-at-the-particle-level/">Gilster writes</a>, “maybe it’s because we’re looking on too large a scale.”</p>
<blockquote><p>What if, in other words, truly advanced intelligence, having long ago taken to non-biological form, finds ways to maximize technology on the level of the very small? Thus [Australian artificial intelligence researcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_de_Garis">Hugo de Garis</a>]’s interest in femtotech, a technology at the level of 10<sup>-15</sup> meters. The idea is to use the properties of quarks and gluons to compute at this scale, where in terms of sheer processing power the improvement in performance is a factor of a trillion trillion over what we can extrapolate for nanotech.</p></blockquote>
<p>Material evidence of this speculative, femto-scale computation could perhaps be detected, in other words, if only we knew we should be looking for it. (Instead, of course, we’re stuck looking for evidence of a very particular technology that was big on Earth a few decades ago—radio waves.)</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/electronz.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Electron interferometry, via the <a href="https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/research/research-groups/sp/facilities/ebl">University of Cambridge</a>, used only for the purpose of illustration.]</small></p>
<p>In any case, it’s interesting to put these thoughts in the context of a paper by Matt Edgeworth, published in <em>Archaeologies</em> back in 2010, called “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11759-010-9125-9">Beyond Human Proportions: Archaeology of the Mega and the Nano</a>.” Edgeworth’s paper was inspired by a deceptively simple insight: that human artifacts, in our era of chemical and material engineering, have departed radically from the spatial scale traditionally associated with archaeology. </p>
<p>We are always making history, we might say, but much of it is too small to see.</p>
<p>Rather than studying architectural ruins or sites the size of villages, what about archaeological artifacts visible only through chemical assays or scanning electron microscopes, whether they be so-called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/03/pfas-forever-chemicals-what-are-they"><em>forever chemicals</em></a> or simply <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/02/how-worried-should-we-be-about-microplastics">microplastics</a>? </p>
<p>Edgeworth himself refers to nano-scale transistors, graphene sheets, and materials etched using electron beam lithography. What role should these engineered materials—altogether different kinds of remains or cultural “ruins”—play in archaeology?</p>

<p>“It used to be the case that archaeological features and artifacts were principally on a human scale,” Edgeworth writes. “But that familiar world is changing fast. As archaeology extends its range of focus further forward in time its subject matter is moving beyond human proportions. Developments in macro- and micro-engineering mean that artifacts are no longer limited in size by physical limitations of the body. As scale and impact of material culture extends outwards and inwards in both macroscopic and microscopic directions, the perspectives of contemporary archaeology must change in order to keep track.”</p>
<p>What’s so interesting about both the <em>Centauri Dreams</em> post and Matt Edgeworth’s paper is that signs of artificiality—whether they are human or not—might be discovered at radically different spatial scales, either here on Earth in modern archaeological sites or in the depths of space, where, for example, the alien equivalent of electron beam lithography might already have etched legible patterns into materials now drifting as micrometeoroids through the void. </p>
<p>Of course, the idea of applying for a grant to look for signs of alien lithography on micrometeoroids sounds more like a <em>Saturday Night Live</em> sketch—or perhaps the plot of a Charles Stross novel—but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do it (or something similar). After all, even humans themselves now leave micro- and nano- scale material traces behind in the dyes, chemicals, coatings, and etched materials we use everyday without thinking of these things as archaeological. </p>

<p>If the fundamental assumption of SETI is that aliens have been communicating with each other through radio transmissions because humans used to heavily rely upon that same technology, then why not also assume that aliens are, say, manufacturing graphene sheets, <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-02-d-nanoscale-metal.html">3D-printing on the nano-scale</a>, or, for that matter, weaving computational textiles with synthetic-diamond nanowires? </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><center><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kyliewhite1.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /></center><small>[Image: “Model of an Earth Fastener on the Delphi Fault (Temple of Apollo)” (2019) by Kylie White; photo courtesy <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/">Moskowitz Bayse</a>.]</small></p>
<p>Artist <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/kylie-white-cv">Kylie White</a> has two new pieces up in a group show here in Los Angeles, called <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/group-exhibition-grammars-of-creation"><em>Grammars of Creation</em></a>, on display at <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/">Moskowitz Bayse</a> till March 16th, which I will return to in a second. </p>
<p>White had a great solo show at the same gallery almost exactly a year ago, featuring a series of <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/kylie-white-six-significant-landscapes">geological faults modeled in richly veined, colored marble</a> Most also incorporated brass details, acting as so-called “Earth fasteners.” </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KylieWhite4.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KylieWhite5.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KylieWhite3.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Images: From <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/kylie-white-six-significant-landscapes"><em>Six Significant Landscapes</em></a> by Kylie White; photos courtesy <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/">Moskowitz Bayse</a>.]</small></p>
<p>Gallery text explained at the time that White’s works “are at once sculptures, scale models, geologic diagrams, and proposals; each depicts an active fault line, a place of displaced terrain due to tectonic movement.” </p>
<p>The “proposal” in each work, of course, would be the fasteners: metal implants of a sort meant to span the rift of an open fault. </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kyliewhite9.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: “Model of Earth Fastener on a Transform Fault; 1”=10” (2017) by Kylie White; note that this piece was not featured in <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/kylie-white-six-significant-landscapes"><em>Six Significant Landscapes</em></a>. Photo courtesy <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/">Moskowitz Bayse</a>.]</small></p>
<p>White’s fasteners seemed to suggest at least two things simultaneously: that perhaps we could fix the Earth’s surface in place, if only we had the means to stop faults from breaking open, but also that human interventions such as these, in otherwise colossal planetary landscapes, would be trivial at best, more sculptural than scientific, just temporary installations not permanent features of a changing continent.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kyliewhite8.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: From <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/kylie-white-six-significant-landscapes"><em>Six Significant Landscapes</em></a> by Kylie White; photo courtesy <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/">Moskowitz Bayse</a>.]</small></p>
<p>As I struggled to explain to my friends, however, while describing White’s work, the visual effect was strangely postmodern, almost tongue-in-cheek, as if her sculptures—all green marble blocks and inlaid brass—could have passed for avant-garde luxury furniture items from the 1980s (and, to be clear, I mean this in a good way: imagine scientific models masquerading as luxury goods).</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KylieWhite6.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kyliewhite7.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Images: Details from <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/kylie-white-six-significant-landscapes"><em>Six Significant Landscapes</em></a> by Kylie White; photos by BLDGBLOG.]</small></p>
<p>All of which means I sort of laughed when I saw these more recent works that seem to take this postmodern aesthetic to a new height, complete with two fault models mounted atop faux-Greek columns. </p>
<p><center><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kyliewhite2.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /></center><small>[Image: “Model of an Earth Fastener on the Hierapolis Fault (Plutonion)” (2019) by Kylie White; photo courtesy <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/">Moskowitz Bayse</a>.]</small></p>
<p>It’s like plate tectonics meets <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/learning-las-vegas-revised-edition"><em>Learning From Las Vegas</em></a>, by way of Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Because the columns are also a fitting reference to the pieces’ own subject matter: one, seen at the top of this post, is called “Model of an Earth Fastener on the Delphi Fault (Temple of Apollo)” and the other, immediately above, is “Model of an Earth Fastener on the Hierapolis Fault (Plutonion).” They perhaps suggest an entirely new approach to natural history museum displays—boldly gridded rooms filled with heroic blocks of the Earth’s surface, bathed in neon. Pomotectonics.</p>
<p>In any case, more information about the show is available at <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/group-exhibition-grammars-of-creation">Moskowitz Bayse</a>. It closes on March 16th, 2020, although White apparently has another, currently untitled solo show coming up in 2021.</p>

<p>I was interested to read last month that “<a href="https://www.citylab.com/design/2020/02/urban-sprawl-street-maps-cities-satellite-images-suburbs/605743/">millions of cul-de-sacs [sic] and dead-ends have proliferated in street networks worldwide</a>,” less because of this observation’s <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/4/1941">intended take-away</a>—which is that neighborhoods around the world are becoming less connected and, thus, less pedestrian-friendly—and more because it sounds like geographers have discovered some sort of short-circuit in the matrix. </p>
<p>Our networks are hitting edges, artificially terminating before their time, leading back on themselves, the very neighborhoods in which we live now recursive and going nowhere, spatial design bugs, caught in loops. </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/florida.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Florida, via Google Maps.]</small></p>
<p>Taken out of context, it suggests the beginning of a new Paul Auster novel, or perhaps something more <a href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/the-geometry-of-sprawl/">Pynchon-esque</a>: a dystopian satire in which a Commissioner of Dead Ends has been hired to figure out why the streets of the world have gone haywire. </p>
<p>No one understands why the weave is sewing closed, a warp out of shape with its weft.</p>

<p>Recall that great line from Umberto Eco’s novel <em>The Name of the Rose</em>: “How beautiful the world would be if there were a procedure for moving through labyrinths.” Only, here, it’s some lonely postal worker—or a geography Ph.D. driven mad by student debt—out mapping the frayed edges of the world, wearily noting every new dead-end and cul-de-sac in a gridded notebook, diagramming loops, sketching labyrinths and mazes, driving empty streets all day on a quest for something undefinable, some answer to why the world’s patterns have gone so wrong. A self-diverging world, where things only almost meet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ten years ago, this would have been a speculative design project by <a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2019/04/design-futures-sacred-groves/">Sascha</a> <a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2019/06/departure/">Pohflepp</a>: “hyper-accumulating” plants are being used to concentrate, and thus “mine,” valuable metals from soil. </p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metaltree.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Nickel-rich sap; photo by Antony van der Ent, courtesy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/science/metal-plants-farm.html"><em>New York Times</em></a>.]</small></p>
<p>“With roots that act practically like magnets, these organisms—about 700 are known—flourish in metal-rich soils that make hundreds of thousands of other plant species flee or die,” the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/science/metal-plants-farm.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> reported last week. “Slicing open one of these trees or running the leaves of its bush cousin through a peanut press produces a sap that oozes a neon blue-green. This ‘juice’ is actually one-quarter nickel, far more concentrated than the ore feeding the world’s nickel smelters.”</p>
<p>A while back, I went on <a href="http://www.ediblegeography.com/forest-hydraulics/">a road-trip with <em>Edible Geography</em> to visit some maple syrup farms</a> north of where we lived at the time, in New York City. The woods all around us were tubed together in a huge, tree-spanning network—“forest hydraulics,” as <em>Edible Geography</em> phrased it at the time—as the trees’ valuable liquid slowly flowed toward a pumping station in the center of the forest. </p>
<p>It was part labyrinth, part spiderweb, a kind of semi-automated tree-machine at odds with the image of nature with which most maple syrup is sold.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mapling1.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mapling3.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mapling4.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Images: Photos by BLDGBLOG.]</small></p>
<p>Imagining a similar landscape, but one designed as a kind of botanical mine—a forest accumulator, metallurgical druidry—is incredible. </p>
<p>And it’s not even a modern idea, as the <em>New York Times</em> points out. For all its apparent, 21st-century sci-fi, the idea of harvesting metal from plants is at least half a millennium old: “The father of modern mineral smelting, Georgius Agricola, saw this potential 500 years ago. He smelted plants in his free time. If you knew what to look for in a leaf, he wrote in the 16th century, you could deduce which metals lay in the ground below.”</p>
<p>This brings to mind an older post here about <a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2011/11/detection-landscapes/"><em>detection landscapes</em></a>, or landscapes—yards, meadows, gardens, forests—deliberately planted with species that can indicate what is in the soil beneath them. </p>
<p>In the specific case of that post, this had archaeological value, allowing researchers to find abandoned Viking settlements in Greenland based on slight chemical changes that have affected which plants are able to thrive. Certain patches of flower, for example, act as <a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2011/11/detection-landscapes/">archaeological indicator species</a>, marking the locations of lost settlements. </p>
<p>In any case, my point is simply that vegetation can be <em>read</em>, or treated as a sign to be interpreted, whether by indicating the presence of archaeological ruins or by revealing the potential market-value of a site’s subterranean metal content.</p>
<p>Indeed, we read, “This vegetation could be the world’s most efficient, solar-powered mineral smelters,” with “the additional value of enabling areas with toxic soils to be made productive. Smallholding farmers could grow on metal-rich soils, and mining companies might use these plants to clean up their former mines and waste and even collect some revenue.” That is, you could filter and clean contaminated soils by drawing heavy-metal pollutants out of the ground, producing saps that are later harvested. </p>
<p>Fast-forward ten years: it’s 2030 and landscape architecture studios around the world are filled with speculative metal-harvesting plant designs—contaminated landscapes laced with gardens of hardy, sap-producing trees—even as industrial behemoths, like Rio Tinto and Barrick Gold, are breeding proprietary tree species in top-secret labs, genetically modifying them to maximize metal uptake. </p>
<p>Weird saps accumulate in iridescent lagoons. Autumn leaves glint, literally metallic, in the sun. Tiny metal capillaries weave up the trunks of black-wooded trees, in filigrees of gold and silver. The occasional forest fire smells not of smoke, but of copper and tin. Reclaimed timber, with knots and veins partially metallized, is used as luxury flooring in suburban homes. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[[Image: From “Probing Cosmic-Ray Transport with Radio Synchrotron Harps in the Galactic Center,” by Timon Thomas, Christoph Pfrommer, and Torsten Enßlin.] The above image, as described by Susanna Kohler over at AAS Nova, depicts an ultra-large-scale magnetic “harp” near the center of our galaxy, emitting radio waves.

<p>The above image, as described by Susanna Kohler over at <a href="https://aasnova.org/2020/02/24/featured-image-playing-harps-in-the-radio-sky/"><em>AAS Nova</em></a>, depicts an ultra-large-scale magnetic “harp” near the center of our galaxy, emitting radio waves. The black lines apparently “span several light-years.” </p>
<p>As Kohler writes, where the parenthetical comments are her own, “a team of scientists argues that this cosmic music is caused by a massive star or a pulsar (a magnetized neutron star) plunging through an ordered magnetic field in the galactic center. As the star crosses (moving upward, in the image above) bundles of field lines, it discharges high-energy cosmic rays that travel in either direction along the bundles, emitting radio waves.” </p>
<p>It’s a kind of cosmic <a href="https://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2017/10/theremin-instrumental-instruments">the</a><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17340257">re</a><a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2014/06/20/us-conductors-theremin">min</a>—an instrument where the “musician controls volume and pitch using her hands <a href="https://uh.edu/engines/epi1818.htm">to interfere with electromagnetic fields generated by the device</a>”—a huge and ancient instrument playing itself in space.</p>

<p>There are many interesting things about <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200217.html">the dimming of Betelgeuse</a>, a giant star in the constellation of Orion’s belt—perhaps a sign that the star is on the verge of exploding in a giant supernova—including the fact that I remember talking about this very scenario in a poetry workshop more than two decades ago. Here we are, still waiting for that light. </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/betel2.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Betelgeuse, during dimming; photo by ESO, M. Montargès et al, via <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200217.html">NASA</a>.]</small></p>
<p>Betelgeuse, of course, is more than 700 lightyears from Earth, which means that it could very well have exploded centuries ago—it could, technically speaking, not even be there anymore, and wasn’t there for your parents or their parents—but the light from that catastrophe simply hasn’t reached Earth. We are always out of synch with the stars we think we’re seeing, unwitting recipients of dead news from above. </p>
<p>Delayed explosions, stars that are no longer there, constellations made of ghosts: the death–or not—of Betelgeuse is the metaphor that gives on giving, as evidenced by the fact that, even in my own lifetime, the topic has come up once again.</p>
<p>But what’s also so interesting about this sort of news is its juxtaposition between human timescales and astral ones, or human awareness colliding with cosmic time more generally: the implication that the universe is capable of extraordinary events that, in the long-term scheme of things, are actually extraordinarily common, but, from within the limits of a human lifetime, even the lifetime of an entire animal species, appear so rare as perhaps never to be encountered. To never be witnessed or even thought possible. There are things that happen only every 100 million years, every billion years, yet here we are right in the middle of it, unaware of strange gravitational inversions or churning, stroboscopic tides of light, of impossible stars and energy forms stranger than all mythology. Black chemistries in space, awaiting catalysis. </p>
<p>There could be physical processes as regular as clockwork pinging off like fireworks—constant, dead rhythms pulsing through the cosmos every two billion years—but our species will never see, hear, or know, because we simply never overlap. </p>
<p>We inhabit the same universe but not the same time.</p>

<p>I’ve been listening to old sets by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/25/andrew-weatherall-interview-dj-disco-maverick">Andrew Weatherall</a> all day, mostly from his long-running show on <a href="https://www.nts.live">NTS</a>, <a href="https://www.nts.live/shows/andrewweatherall/"><em>Music’s Not For Everyone</em></a>. Like a million other people, I’m still shocked by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/17/andrew-weatherall-lone-swordsman-who-cut-new-shapes-for-british-music">news of his death</a>. </p>
<p>Weatherall’s taste in music was idiosyncratic, in the best possible sense, animated by something much larger than—and outside—the music, as evidenced by his own introductions to his show. “Greetings, sisters and brothers,” Weatherall usually began. “Welcome to the temple of gnostic sonics.” From that moment on, the bass lines were heavy, the beats repetitive, the mood as high as his own cannabinoid proclivities. </p>
<p>He had at least two famous tattoos: “Fail We May,” one forearm said. “Sail We Must,” replied the other. And we must.</p>
<p>I never even met the guy, but—tired-looking, grey-haired, unbothered—Weatherall has left the world. Here are <a href="https://www.nts.live/shows/andrewweatherall">at least 140 hours’ worth of his sets</a>, dating back to 2014. </p>
