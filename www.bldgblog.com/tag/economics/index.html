		<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/casparfriedrice.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderer_above_the_Sea_of_Fog"><em>Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer</em></a> by Caspar David Friedrich (c. 1818).]</small></p>
<p>It would be interesting to look at locations of the American popular imagination, as seen in movies and TV, mapped against regional tax breaks for the film industry. </p>
<p>There was a brief span of time, for example, when rural Pennsylvania stood in for <em>authentic Americana</em>, a kind of Rust Belt imaginary, all pick-up trucks and hard-drinking younger brothers, stories framed against the hulking ruins of industrial landscapes—I’m thinking of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_Furnace"><em>Out Of The Furnace</em></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_(2013_film)"><em>Prisoners</em></a>, both released in 2013, or even 2010’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstoppable_(2010_film)"><em>Unstoppable</em></a>. Whereas, today, Georgia seems to have stepped into that niche, between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsider_(miniseries)"><em>The Outsider</em></a> and, say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindhunter_(TV_series)"><em>Mindhunter</em></a> (season two), let alone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_(TV_series)"><em>Atlanta</em></a>, no doubt precisely because Georgia has <a href="https://variety.com/2018/film/features/georgias-production-incentives-seal-the-deal-for-hollywood-1202990450/">well-known tax incentives</a> in place for filming. </p>
<p>My point is that an entire generation of people—not just Americans, but film viewers and coronavirus quarantine streamers and TV binge-watchers around the world—might have their imaginative landscapes shaped not by immaterial forces, by symbolic archetypes or universal rules bubbling up from the high-pressure depths of human psychology, but instead by tax breaks offered in particular U.S. states at particular moments in American history. </p>
<p>You grow up thinking about Gothic pine forests, or you fall asleep at night with visions of rain-soaked Georgia parking lots crowding your head, but it’s not just because of the aesthetic or atmospheric appeal of those landscapes; it’s because those landscapes are, in effect, receiving imaginative subsidies from local business bureaus. You’re dreaming of them for a reason.</p>
<p>Your mind is not immaterial, in other words, some angelic force waltzing across the surface of the world, stopping now and again to dwell on universal imagery, but something deeply mundane, something sculpted by ridiculous things, like whether or not camera crews in a given state get hotel room discounts for productions lasting more than two weeks.</p>
<p>Of course, you could extend a similar kind of analysis way back into art history and look at, say, the opening of particular landscapes in western Europe, after decades of war, suddenly made safe for cultured travelers such as Caspar David Friedrich, whose paintings later came to define an entire era of European and European-descended male imaginations. That <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderer_above_the_Sea_of_Fog">wanderer over a sea of fog</a>, in other words, was wandering through a very specific landscape during a very particular window of European political accessibility. Had things been different, had history taken a slightly different path, Friedrich might have been stuck in his parents’ house, painting still-lives and weed-choked alleyways, and who knows what images today’s solo hikers might be daydreaming about instead.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/outsider.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: From <a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-outsider"><em>The Outsider</em></a>, courtesy <a href="https://www.hbo.com/">HBO</a>; I should mention that <em>The Outsider</em> was set and filmed primarily in Georgia, a departure from Stephen King’s novel, which was primarily set in Oklahoma.]</small></p>
<p>In any case, the humid forests of rural America, the looming water towers and abandoned industrial facilities, the kudzu-covered strip malls and furloughed police stations—picture the Louisianan expanses of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective"><em>True Detective</em></a> (season one)—have come to represent the dark narrative potential of the contemporary world. But what if, say, North Dakota or Manitoba (where, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grudge_(2020_film)"><em>The Grudge</em></a> was recently filmed) had offered better tax breaks? </p>
<p>My own childhood imagination was a world of sunlit suburbs, detached single-family homes, and long-shadowed neighborhood secrets, but, as to my larger point here, I also grew up watching movies like <em>E.T.</em>, <em>Poltergeist</em>, <em>Fright Night</em>, and <em>Blue Velvet</em>—so, in a sense, <em>of course</em> I would think that’s what the world looked like. </p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bluevelveeta.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: From David Lynch’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Velvet_(film)"><em>Blue Velvet</em></a> (1986), specifically via the site <a href="https://velveteyes.net/movie-stills/blue-velvet/">Velvet Eyes</a>.]</small></p>
<p>So, again, it would be interesting to explore how one’s vision of the world—your most fundamental imagination of the cosmos—is being shaped for you by tax breaks, film incentives, and other, utterly trivial local concerns, like whether or not out-of-state catering companies can get refunds on expenditures over a certain amount or where actors can write off per diems as gifts, not income, affecting whether crime films or horror stories will be shot there, and thus where an entire generation’s future nightmares might be set. </p>
<p>Or, for that matter, you could look at when particular colors, paints, and pigments became affordable for artists of a certain era, resulting in all those dark and moody images you love to stare at in the local museum—e.g. the old joke that, at some point, Rembrandt simply bought too much purple. It wasn’t promethean inspiration; it was material surplus.</p>
<p>We see things for a reason, yet, over and over again, mistake our dreams for signs of the cosmic. Or, to put this another way, we are not surrounded by mythology; we are surrounded by economics. The latter is a superb and confusing mimic.</p>

<p>Taps mic&#8230; Is this thing still on&#8230; </p>
<p><b>1.</b> <em>Hidden Charms</em> was a conference on “<a href="http://www.apotropaios.co.uk/conference-2018.html">the magical protection of buildings</a>,” organized by <a href="http://www.apotropaios.co.uk/brian-hoggard1.html">Brian Hoggard</a>. The one-day symposium looked at everything from ritual “<a href="http://www.apotropaios.co.uk/protection-marks.html">protection marks</a>” to <a href="http://www.apotropaios.co.uk/paula-mcbride.html">dead cats stored in glass jars</a>, put there “to keep the witches away.” </p>
<p><b>2.</b> Amazon wants to put robots in every home. “The retail and cloud computing giant has embarked on an ambitious, top-secret plan to build a domestic robot, according to people familiar with the plans. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-23/amazon-is-said-to-be-working-on-another-big-bet-home-robots">Codenamed ‘Vesta,’ after the Roman goddess of the hearth, home and family</a>,” the robot “could be a sort of mobile Alexa,” <em>Businessweek</em> speculates, “accompanying customers in parts of their home where they don’t have Echo devices. Prototypes of the robots have advanced cameras and computer vision software and can navigate through homes like a self-driving car.”</p>
<p><b>3.</b> A woman in Austin, Texas, went missing in 2015. Without monthly payments, her house was eventually seized and sold by the bank—but the home’s new owners found the skeletal remains of a body inside one of the walls back in March. <a href="https://www.statesman.com/news/national/woman-whose-bones-were-found-home-walls-likely-fell-death-through-attic-floor/aVzqIQSXtOpo8J9VhDnnhI/">It was the missing woman</a>. “In the attic, there was a broken board that led down to the space” where the skeleton was found, a coroner’s spokesperson explained. “Law enforcement thinks she may have been up in the attic and fell through the attic floor.” Horrifically, whether she was killed by the fall or remained alive, trapped inside the wall, is unclear. </p>
<p><b>4.</b> At an event here in Los Angeles a few weeks ago, artist and writer <a href="http://www.juliachristensen.com/">Julia Christensen</a> drew my attention to officially recognized “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_constellations">former constellations</a>,” or named star groups that are no longer considered referentially viable. </p>
<p><b>5.</b> The Roman monetary system left <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/560339/">a planetary-archaeological trace in Greenland’s ice sheet</a>, according to Rob Meyer of <em>The Atlantic</em>. “A team of archaeologists, historians, and climate scientists have constructed a history of Rome’s lead pollution,” Meyer explains, “which allows them to approximate Mediterranean economic activity from 1,100 b.c. to 800 a.d. They found it hiding thousands of miles from the Roman Forum: deep in the Greenland Ice Sheet, the enormous, miles-thick plate of ice that entombs the North Atlantic island.” With this data, they have “reconstructed year-by-year economic data documenting the rise and fall of the Roman Republic and Empire.” Oddly enough, this means the Greenland Ice Sheet is a landscape-scale archive of Roman financial data. </p>
<p><b>6.</b> Speaking of economic data mined from indirect sources, “satellite imagery that tracks changes in the level of nighttime lighting within and between countries over time” might also reveal <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/05/15/satellite-data-strongly-suggests-that-china-russia-and-other-authoritarian-countries-are-fudging-their-gdp-reports/">whether countries are lying about the strengths of their economies</a>. According to researcher Luis R. Martinez, “increases in nighttime lighting generally track with increases in GDP,” and this becomes of interest when lighting levels don’t correspond with officially given numbers. Of course, this is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/duping-the-satellite-and-other-adventures-in-landscape-recognition/485921/">not the first time</a> that satellite imagery has been used to estimate economic data. </p>
<p><b>7.</b> “Today our experience of the night differs significantly from that of our ancestors,” Nancy Gonlin and April Nowell write for <em>Sapiens</em>. “Before they mastered fire, early humans lived roughly half their lives in the dark.” Cue the rise of “archaeological inquiries into the night,” or what Gonlin and Nowell have evocatively named the “<a href="https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/night-archaeology/">archaeology of night</a>.”</p>
<p><b>8.</b> There was an amazing article by Jake Halpern published in <em>The New Yorker</em> two years ago about <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/09/searching-for-nazi-gold">Nazi gold fever in Poland</a> and the incredible amount of amateur detective operations there dedicated to finding an alleged buried fortune. It’s a wild mix of abandoned WWII bunkers, secret underground cities in the forest, and urban legends of untold wealth. It turns out, however, there is a (vaguely) similar obsession with lost or buried gold in northwestern Pennsylvania: “For decades, treasure hunters in Pennsylvania have suspected that there is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/us/gold-fbi-civil-war.html">a trove of Civil War gold lost in a rural forest</a> in the northwestern part of the state,” the <em>New York Times</em> reports. “The story of the gold bars was pieced together from old documents, a map and even a mysterious note found decades ago in a hiding place on the back of a bed post in Caledonia,” the paper explains. </p>
<p><b>9.</b> People are drawn to forests for all sorts of reasons. As Alex Mar wrote last autumn for the <em>Virginia Quarterly Review</em>, the Slender Man phenomenon—that inspired two young girls to try to murder a classmate—also had a forest element. “<a href="https://www.vqronline.org/essays-articles/2017/10/out-came-girls">Girls lured out into the dark woods</a>—this is the stuff of folk tales from so many countries,” Mar writes, “a New World fear of the Puritans, an image at the heart of witchcraft and the occult, timeless.” Mar points out that, after the attempted murder, the two girls began heading “to Wisconsin’s Nicolet National Forest on foot, nearly 200 miles north. They were convinced that, once there, if they pushed farther and farther into the nearly 700,000-acre forest, they would find the mansion in which their monster [Slender Man] dwells and he would welcome them.” The whole article is an interesting look at childhood, folklore, and the sometimes dark allure of the wild. </p>
<p><b>10.</b> More treasure hunts: is there a cache of buried armaments, stolen from a National Guard armory in 1970, hidden somewhere in Amesbury, Massachusetts? <a href="http://castboolits.gunloads.com/showthread.php?324902-1970-National-Guard-Armory-robbery">According to a commenter on the <em>Cast Boolits</em> forum</a>, William Gilday, who once “led <a href="http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/09/16/william_lefty_gilday_dies_at_82/">an assault on a National Guard armory in Newburyport</a>” and who spent nearly half of his life in prison for killing a police officer, confessed on his death bed that he buried guns and ammunition stolen from the armory somewhere in his hometown of Amesbury. “It&#8217;s one of those ‘what if’ things,” the commenter continues. “I’ve known about the confession for years, and I walk my dog in the ‘suspected’ vicinity just about every day. The problem is that the ‘authorities’ claim that everything that was stolen was recovered. But, a few weeks ago, I emailed a local radio talk show host who was involved in the death bed confession and I asked her if she thought that stolen items really had been buried in my town and she replied, ‘Yes&#8230;do you know where they are?’” </p>
<p><b>11.</b> “A dispute between Serbia and Kosovo has disrupted the electric power grid for most of the Continent, making certain kinds of clocks—many of those on ovens, in heating systems and on radios—run <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/world/europe/kosovo-serbia-clocks-europe.html">up to six minutes slow</a>,” the <em>New York Times</em> reported back in March. “The fluctuation in the power supply is infinitesimally small—not nearly enough to make a meaningful difference for most powered devices—and if it were a brief disturbance, the effect on clocks might be too little to worry about.” But this six-minute lag is enough to cause subtle effects in people’s lives. A bad first novel could be written about slow clocks, distant political disputes, and some sort of disastrous event—a missed train, a skipped meeting—in the narrator’s personal life. </p>
<p><b>12.</b> The above story reminds me of the suspicion last year that Russia was using some sort of large-scale GPS jamming device in the Black Sea. “Reports of satellite navigation problems in the Black Sea suggest that Russia may be testing a new system for spoofing GPS,” David Hambling reported for <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2143499-ships-fooled-in-gps-spoofing-attack-suggest-russian-cyberweapon/"><em>New Scientist</em></a>. “This could be the first hint of a new form of electronic warfare available to everyone from rogue nation states to petty criminals.” The reason I say this is because you can easily imagine a scenario where someone is driving around, totally lost, receiving contradictory if not frankly nonsensical navigation instructions, and it’s because they are an unwitting, long-distance victim of geographic weaponry being used in a war zone far away.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> The legendary music fest Sónar has been <a href="https://www.sonarcalling.com/en/">sending music to “a potentially habitable exoplanet” called GJ273b</a>, <a href="https://sonar.es/en/2018/news/sonar-celebrates-25-years-of-the-festival-by-contacting-intelligent-extraterrestial-life">attempting to contact alien intelligence with transmissions of electronic music</a>. Transmission 1 was sent back in October; Transmission 2 ended today. The transmissions should arrive at the planet in November 2030. </p>

<p><small><em>An <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27184-new-urbanist-off-world-colonies-of-the-canadian-arctic/">earlier version</a> of this post was published on New Scientist back in 2015.</em></small></p>
<p>Speaking at a <a href="http://www.oculs.no/events/future-north-session-arctic-frontiers/">symposium on Arctic urbanism</a>, held at the end of January 2015 in Tromsø, Norway, architectural historian <a href="http://architecture.umontreal.ca/architecture/professeurs/fiche/utilisateur/alessandra-ponte-177/">Alessandra Ponte</a> introduced her audience to some of Canada’s most remote northern mining towns. </p>
<p>Ponte had recently taken a group of students on a research trip through the boreal landscape, hoping to understand the types of settlements that had been popping up with increasing frequency there. This included a visit to the mining village of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/pw1w8SL85E22">Fermont, Quebec</a>.</p>
<p>Designed by architects Norbert Schoenauer and Maurice Desnoyers, Fermont features a hotel, a hospital, a small Metro supermarket, and even a tourism bureau—for all that, however, it is run entirely by the firm ArcelorMittal, which also owns the nearby iron mine. This means that there are no police, who would be funded by the Canadian government; instead, Fermont is patrolled by its own private security force.</p>
<p>The town is also home to an extraordinary architectural feature: a residential megastructure whose explicit purpose is to redirect the local weather. </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/fermontwindshadows.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Wind-shadow studies, Fermont; courtesy <a href="http://cac.mcgill.ca/schoenauer/cases/urban-fermont.htm">Blackader-Lauterman Library of Architecture and Art</a>, McGill University].</small></p>
<p>Known as the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/pastepisodes/2013/april/mur-%C3%A9cran-the-windscreen-1.464969"><em>mur-écran</em></a> or “windscreen,” the structure is nearly a mile in length and shaped roughly like a horizontal V or chevron. Think of it as a climatological Maginot Line, a fortification against the sky built to resist the howling, near-constant northern winds.</p>
<p>In any other scenario, a weather-controlling super-wall would sound like pure science fiction. But extreme environments such as those found in the far north are, by necessity, laboratories of architectural innovation, requiring the invention of new, often quite radical, context-appropriate building types. </p>
<p>In Fermont, urban climate control is built into the very fabric of the city—and has been since the 1970s. </p>

<p><strong>Offworld boom towns</strong></p>
<p>In a 2014 interview with <em>Aeon</em>, entrepreneur Elon Musk argued for the need to establish human settlements on other planets, beginning with a collection of small cities on Mars. Musk, however, infused this vision with a strong sense of moral obligation, urging us all “<a href="https://aeon.co/essays/elon-musk-puts-his-case-for-a-multi-planet-civilisation">to be laser-focused on becoming a multi-planet civilization</a>.”</p>
<p>Humans <em>must</em> go to Mars, he implored the Royal Aeronautical Society back in 2012. Once there, he proposed, we can finally “<a href="http://www.space.com/18596-mars-colony-spacex-elon-musk.html">start a self-sustaining civilization and grow it into something really big</a>”—where <em>really big</em>, for Musk, means establishing a network of towns and villages. Cities.</p>
<p>Of course, Musk is not talking about building a Martian version of London or Paris—at least, not yet. Rather, these sorts of remote, privately operated industrial activities require housing and administrative structures, not parks and museums; security teams, not mayors. </p>
<p>These roughshod “man camps,” as they are anachronistically known, are simply “cobbled together in a hurry,” energy reporter Russell Gold writes in his book <a href="http://amzn.to/2kHCrzk"><em>The Boom</em></a>. Man camps, Gold continues, are “sprawling complexes of connected modular buildings,” unlikely to be mistaken for a real town or civic center.</p>
<p>In a sense, then, we are already experimenting with offworld colonization—but we are doing it in the windswept villages and extraction sites of the Canadian north. Our Martian future is already under construction here on Earth. </p>

<p><strong>Just-in-time urbanism</strong></p>
<p>Industrial settlements such as Russell Gold’s fracking camps in the American West or those in the Canadian North are most often run by subsidiary services corporations, such as <a href="https://www.bakerhughes.com/">Baker Hughes</a>, <a href="http://oilfieldlodging.com/">Oilfield Lodging</a>, <a href="http://www.targetlogistics.net/">Target Logistics</a>, or the aptly named <a href="http://civeo.com/">Civeo</a>. </p>
<p>The last of these—whose very name implies <em>civics</em> reduced to the catchiness of an IPO—actually lists “villages” as one of its primary spatial products. These are sold as “integrated accommodation solutions” that you can order wholesale, like a piece of flatpak furniture, an entire pop-up city given its own tracking number and delivery time.</p>
<p>Civeo, in fact, recently survived a period of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2014/12/31/hedge-fund-jana-partners-dumps-plunging-civeo-shares-after-winning-board-seats-in-october">hedge-fund-induced economic turbulence</a>—but this experience also serves as a useful indicator for how the private cities of the future might be funded. It is not through taxation or local civic participation, in other words: their fate will instead be determined by distant economic managers who might cancel their investment at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>A dystopian scenario in which an entire Arctic—or, in the future, Martian—city might be abandoned and shut down overnight for lack of sufficient economic returns is not altogether implausible. It is urbanism by stock price and spreadsheet.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/fermontconstruction.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Constructing Fermont, courtesy <a href="http://cac.mcgill.ca/schoenauer/cases/large_image.php?slideid=266">Blackader-Lauterman Library of Architecture and Art</a>, McGill University].</small></p>
<p>Consider the case of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/V9oicAxXz7u">Gagnon, Quebec</a>. In 1985, Alessandra Ponte explained, the town of Gagnon ceased to exist. Each building was taken apart down to its foundations and hauled away to be sold for scrap. Nothing was left but the ghostly, overgrown grid of Gagnon’s former streets, and even those would eventually be reabsorbed into the forest. It was as if nothing had been there at all. Creeks now flow where pick-up trucks stood thirty years ago. </p>
<p>In the past, abandoned cities would be allowed to molder, turning into picturesque ruins and archaeological parks, but the mining towns of the Canadian north meet an altogether different fate. Inhabited one decade and completely gone the next, these are not new Romes of the Arctic Circle, but something more like an urban mirage, an economic Fata Morgana in the ice and snow.</p>
<p><strong>Martian pop-ups</strong></p>
<p>Modular buildings that can be erased without trace; obscure financial structures based in venture capital, not taxation; climate-controlling megastructures: these pop-up settlements, delivered by private corporations in extreme landscapes, are the cities Elon Musk has been describing. We are more likely to build a second Gagnon than a new Manhattan at the foot of <a href="http://www.space.com/20133-olympus-mons-giant-mountain-of-mars.html">Olympus Mons</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, instant prefab cities dropped into the middle of nowhere are a perennial fantasy of architectural futurists. One need look no further than British avant-pop provocateurs <a href="http://archigram.westminster.ac.uk/">Archigram</a>, with their candy-colored comic book drawings of “plug-in cities” sprouting amidst remote landscapes like ready-made utopias.</p>
<p>But there is something deeply ironic in the fact that this fantasy is now being realized by extraction firms and multinational corporations—and that this once radical vision of the urban future might very well be the perfect logistical tool that helps humankind achieve a foothold on Mars.</p>
<p>In other words, shuttles and spacesuits were the technologies that took us to the moon, but it will be <em>cities</em> that take us to new worlds. Whether or not any of us will actually want to live in a Martian Fermont is something that remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The incoming Republican Congress has redefined U.S. federal lands as being “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/19/bureau-land-management-federal-lease">effectively worthless</a>,” making it easier to return those lands to state control, and then to auction them off to private ownership or future industrial use. </p>
<p>“In a single line of changes to the rules for the House of Representatives, Republicans have overwritten the value of federal lands, easing the path to disposing of federal property even if doing so loses money for the government and provides no demonstrable compensation to American citizens,” the <em>Guardian</em> reports. </p>
<p>“Essentially, the revised budget rules deny that federal land has any value at all, allowing the new Congress to sidestep requirements that a bill giving away a piece of federal land does not decrease federal revenue or contribute to the federal debt.”</p>
<p>As such, “federal land is effectively worthless.”  </p>
<p>That people who voted for this party to be in power will be amongst the hundreds of thousands of Americans who drive west every summer to experience the natural beauty of the United States is so politically absurd that it is worth pointing out here, however briefly. </p>
<p>This is <a href="http://www.hcn.org/articles/2016-gop-platform-pushes-federal-land-transfers">what those same voters rejected</a> at the ballot box in November: “As a nation, we need policies and investments that will keep America’s public lands public, strengthen protections for our natural and cultural resources, increase access to parks and public lands for all Americans, protect species and wildlife, and harness the immense economic and social potential of our public lands and waters.” Their votes have also made it <a href="http://grist.org/election-2016/11-ways-the-republican-platform-attacks-the-environment/">far more difficult to declare future National Monuments and National Parks</a>, let alone to maintain the ones we already have.</p>
<p>Those same people will come home next summer with their smartphones and digital cameras full of images of extraordinary landscapes their own party just sold off the table for scrap.</p>

<p>For the past few months, on various trips out west to Los Angeles, I’ve been working on an exclusive story about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/threat-center/510644/">a new intelligence-gathering unit at LAX</a>, the Los Angeles International Airport. </p>
<p>To make a long story short, in the summer of 2014 Los Angeles World Airports—the parent organization in control of LAX—hired two intelligence analysts, both with top secret clearance, in order to analyze global threats targeting the airport. </p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2016-11-16-18.46.55.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>There were many things that brought me to this story, but what particularly stood out was the very idea that a piece of transportation infrastructure could now punch above its weight, taking on the intelligence-gathering and analytical capabilities not just of a city, but of a small nation-state. </p>
<p>It implied a kind of parallel intelligence organization created to protect not a democratic polity but an airfield. This suggested to me that perhaps our models of where power actually lies in the contemporary city are misguided—that, instead of looking to City Hall, for example, we should be focusing on economic structures, ports, sites of logistics, places that wield a different sort of influence and require a new kind of protection and security. </p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2016-11-18-10.09.42.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>From the article, which is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/threat-center/510644/">now online at <em>The Atlantic</em></a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Under the moniker of “critical infrastructure protection,” energy-production, transportation-logistics, waste-disposal, and other sites have been transformed from often-overlooked megaprojects on the edge of the metropolis into the heavily fortified, tactical crown jewels of the modern state. Bridges, tunnels, ports, dams, pipelines, and airfields have an emergent geopolitical clout that now rivals democratically elected civic institutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>For me, this has incredible implications: </p>
<blockquote><p>It might sound like science fiction, but, in 20 years’ time, it could very well be that LAX has a stronger international-intelligence game than many U.S. allies. LAX field agents could be embedded overseas, cultivating informants, sussing out impending threats. It will be an era of infrastructural intelligence, when airfields, bridges, ports, and tunnels have, in effect, their own internal versions of the CIA—and LAX will be there first.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are obvious shades here of Keller Easterling’s notion of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extrastatecraft-Power-Infrastructure-Keller-Easterling/dp/1784783641//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=65835f796dccf5a480941f920b1de8fb">extrastatecraft</a>,” where infrastructure has come to assume a peculiar form of political authority. </p>
<p>As such, it also resembles an initiative undertaken by the NYPD in the years immediately following 9/11—a story well told by at least three books, Peter Bergen’s excellent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/United-States-Jihad-Homegrown-Terrorists/dp/0804139563//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=72bfee405a8aa8eb9578e345fb1e1be2"><em>United States of Jihad</em></a>, Christopher Dickey’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Securing-City-Americas-Counterterror-Force/dp/1416552413//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=488164f0fb15b6934cbbe81fbca61ca9"><em>Securing the City</em></a>, and, more critically, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enemies-Within-Inside-Against-America/dp/1476727945//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=8c82ee307f55a99a119c4d6d28ac50eb"><em>Enemies Within</em></a> by Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman. </p>
<p>However, there is at least one key difference here: the NYPD unit was operating as an urban-scale intelligence apparatus, whereas the L.A. initiative exists at the level of a piece of transportation infrastructure. Imagine the Holland Tunnel, I-90, or the M25 hiring its own in-house intel team, and you can begin to imagine the strange new powers and influence this implies.  </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2016-11-18-10.08.51.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In any case, the bulk of the piece is focused on introducing readers to the core group of people behind the program. </p>
<p>There is Anthony McGinty, a former D.C. homicide detective and Marine Reserve veteran, kickstarting a second career on the west coast; there is Michelle Sosa, a trilingual Boston University grad with a background in intelligence analysis; and there is Ethel McGuire, one of the first black female agents in FBI history, who undertook their hiring. </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2016-11-18-10.07.13-2.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>There are, of course, literally thousands of others of people involved, from baggage handlers and the LAX Fire Department to everyday travelers. LAX, after all, is a city in miniature: </p>
<blockquote><p>At more than five square miles, it is only slightly smaller than Beverly Hills. More than 50,000 badged employees report to work there each day, many with direct access to the airfield—and thus to the vulnerable aircraft waiting upon it. More than 100,000 passenger vehicles use the airport’s roads and parking lots every day, and, in 2015 alone, LAX hosted 75 million passengers in combined departures and arrivals.</p>
<p>LAX is also policed like a city. The airport has its own SWAT team—known as the Emergency Services Unit—and employs roughly 500 sworn police officers, double the number of cops in the well-off city of Pasadena and more than the total number of state police in all of Rhode Island.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the actual space of the airport—the built landscape of logistics—is probably the main potential source of interest for BLDGBLOG readers. </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2016-11-16-18.48.22.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>For example, at the western edge of the airfield, there is an abandoned suburb called Surfridge, its empty streets and sand dunes now used as a butterfly sanctuary and as a place for police-training simulations. The runways themselves are vast symbolic landscapes painted with geometric signs that have to be read to be navigated. And then there are the terminals, currently undergoing a massive, multibillion dollar renovation campaign. </p>
<p>At one point, I found myself sitting inside the office complex of Gavin de Becker, an anti-assassination security expert who has worked for celebrities, foreign dignitaries, and even U.S. presidents. Protected behind false-front signage, de Becker’s hidden complex houses a full-scale airplane fuselage for emergency training, as well as ballistic dummies and a soundproofed shooting range. </p>

<p>I had a blast working on this piece, and am thrilled that it’s finally online. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/threat-center/510644/">Check it out</a>, if you get a chance, and don’t miss the speculative “case files” at the end, brief examples of what might be called infrastructural security fiction.</p>

		<p>With the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/11/rex-tillerson-secretary-of-state-trump-russia-putin">expected nomination</a> of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to the position of U.S. Secretary of State, the recent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Private-Empire-ExxonMobil-American-Power/dp/0143123548//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=8f81c22e59a6258bdd665124d9843491"><em>Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power</em></a> by Columbia University dean of journalism Steve Coll seems newly relevant—so much so that, following Friday’s news about the nomination, Amazon has been temporarily sold out. </p>
<p>Coll has also just published a new piece over at <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rex-tillerson-from-a-corporate-oil-sovereign-to-the-state-department"><em>The New Yorker</em></a> looking at Tillerson’s legacy with the global oil firm. There, Coll describes ExxonMobil as resembling “an independent, transnational corporate sovereign in the world, a power independent of the American government, one devoted firmly to shareholder interests and possessed of its own foreign policy.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Exxon’s foreign policy sometimes had more impact on the countries where it operated than did the State Department. Take, for example, Chad, one of the poorest countries in Africa. During the mid-two-thousands, the entirety of U.S. aid and military spending in the country directed through the U.S. Embassy in the capital, N’Djamena, amounted to less than twenty million dollars annually, whereas the royalty payments Exxon made to the government as part of an oil-production agreement were north of five hundred million dollars. Idriss Déby, the authoritarian President of Chad, did not need a calculator to understand that Rex Tillerson was more important to his future than the U.S. Secretary of State.</p></blockquote>
<p>Should Tillerson be confirmed, Coll suggests, his new role “will certainly confirm the assumption of many people around the world that American power is best understood as a raw, neocolonial exercise in securing resources.” </p>
<p><em>The Guardian</em> agrees, suggesting that, “In a very real sense, Tillerson has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/11/rex-tillerson-secretary-of-state-trump-russia-putin">a head of a state within a state</a>. Exxon Mobil is bigger economically than many countries. It has its own foreign policy and its own contracted security forces.”</p>
<p>Consider picking up a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Private-Empire-ExxonMobil-American-Power/dp/0143123548//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=8f81c22e59a6258bdd665124d9843491"><em>Private Empire</em></a> and read more from Coll over at <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rex-tillerson-from-a-corporate-oil-sovereign-to-the-state-department"><em>The New Yorker</em></a>.</p>

<p>Citing lack of new business and a changing marketplace, the <a href="http://www.whitechapelbellfoundry.co.uk/">Whitechapel Bell Foundry</a> has put itself up for sale, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9269518a-b87d-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62"><em>Financial Times</em></a> reports. </p>
<p>“We are just commencing work on a new peal of bells for St Albans after 43 years of negotiation,” company owner Alan Hughes is quoted as saying. “That’s an example of the timescale we are working on—at least 10 years between order and delivery is normal.”</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2012-08-03-14.10.51.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: The beautiful, gleaming interior of a newly tuned church bell; Instagram by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bldgblog/">BLDGBLOG</a>].</small></p>
<p>However, the <em>Financial Times</em> adds, “the business has faced two other structural challenges. Bells, unlike modern devices, are made to last centuries. The other weakness of the company is that Whitechapel’s main customer, the Church of England, is in decline with congregations in the UK halving in the past 40 years.”</p>

<p><em>Bloomberg</em> has a look at the subterranean warehousing strategies of the very rich, including former Swiss military caves and bunkers that have been <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-30/secret-swiss-gold-vaults-are-the-new-swiss-bank-accounts">repurposed as private gold vaults</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Deep in the Swiss Alps, next to an old airstrip suitable for landing Gulfstream and Falcon jets, is a vast bunker that holds what may be one of the world’s largest stashes of gold. The entrance, protected by a guard in a bulletproof vest, is a small metal door set into a granite mountain face at the end of a narrow country lane. Behind two farther doors sits a 3.5-ton metal portal that opens only after a code is entered and an iris scan and a facial-recognition screen are performed. A maze of tunnels once used by Swiss armed forces lies within.</p></blockquote>
<p>These “Swiss storage operations,” as the article describes them, can be seen as spatial byproducts of international financial loopholes, such as the fact that U.S. citizens “aren’t required under the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act to declare gold stored outside financial institutions,” or that these sorts of storage firms “aren’t regulated by the Swiss financial-services regulator Finma. Nor do such companies have to report suspicious activity to Switzerland’s Money Laundering Reporting Office.” </p>
<p>These regulations—or, rather, the lack thereof—assume architectural form: sites of temporary burial for monetary instruments that benefit from being held securely beyond the reach of the active economy. </p>
<p>Now for the inevitable heist film—part <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200465/"><em>Bank Job</em></a>, part <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork"><em>Zork</em></a>—set in the high-tech mountain bunkers of Switzerland&#8230;</p>

This is not as straightforward as it might seem:</p>
<blockquote><p>It seems hard to lose track of an entire city. But that appears to be what’s taken place—and not just once, but over and over again. The infamous “ghost cities” of China have become a favorite internet meme of the past half-decade. These ghost cities are meant to be sprawling wastelands of empty streets and uninhabited megastructures, without a human being in sight. But for all the discussion, do these places really exist?</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of the piece looks at various strategies put to use not only for quantifying but for simply locating these developments in the first place. This includes data analysis and satellite photography—but, just as compellingly, on-the-ground firsthand exploration.</p>
<p> <img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 5px; text-align:center;" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5758/22820736834_b9a1e1ca5d_o.jpg?resize=535%2C670&#038;ssl=1" width="535" height="670" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Photo by <a href="http://kaimichael.com">Kai Caemmerer</a>].</small><br /><Br> Here, I talked to photographer <a href="http://kaimichael.com">Kai Caemmerer</a> who has recently undertaken a series of photos exploring what he calls &#8220;unborn cities,&#8221; or cities not dead and expired—that is, not <i>ghost cities</i>—but cities that are incomplete and still awaiting their future populations.<br /><Br> &#8220;Unlike many Western cities that begin as small developments and grow in accordance with local industries, gathering community and history as they age,&#8221; Caemmerer explains, &#8220;these areas are built to the point of near completion before introducing people.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Because of this, there is an interim period between the final phases of development and when the areas become noticeably populated, when many of the buildings stand empty, occasionally still cloaked in scrim. During this phase of development, sensationalist Western media often describe them as defunct &#8220;ghost cities,&#8221; which fails to recognize that they are built on an urban model, timeline, and scale that is simply unfamiliar to the methods of Western urbanization.</p></blockquote>
<p> Caemmerer continued, pointing out that his interest in ostensibly empty urban environments is not about shaming China, or implying that unused architectural space is somehow only a non-Western problem. In fact, in another series—a few example of which I hope to post here in the near-future—Caemmerer turns his lens on his own home city of Chicago.</p>

		<p><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 5px; text-align:center;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lawless1.jpg" width="535" height="356" /><small>[Image: Photo by <a href="http://sephlawless.com">Seph Lawless</a>, from his book <a href="http://www.sephlawless-shop.com/product/autopsy-of-america"><i>Autopsy of America</i></a>].</small></p>
<p> Many of the ideas being proposed these days for housing international refugees, including families fleeing from the war in Syria, are beginning to sound less like genuine examples of humanitarian outreach and more like a strange new form of hide-and-seek, a bizarre ploy at stashing live human beings in ever-more resourceful locations, like searching for a clever new place beneath your back stairs to store excess home goods. </p>
<p> Three stories, in particular, seem to stand out for this—coming across not as real solutions to human tragedy but as a kind of abstract mathematical exercise. </p>
<p> A notable example of this came last year, in the summer of 2014, when FEMA was allegedly looking into housing migrant children—that is, &#8220;unaccompanied minors&#8221; from countries outside the United States—<a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118781/fema-seeking-empty-big-box-stores-house-migrant-children">inside abandoned shopping malls and empty big box stores</a>. </p>
<p> As <i>The New Republic</i> reported at the time, FEMA was searching for examples of an &#8220;&#8216;office space, warehouse, big box store, shopping mall with interior concourse, event venues, hotel or dorms, aircraft hangers [sic]&#8217;—provided that they are vacant and able to be leased.&#8221; <br /><Br> The strange dystopia of this—cramming literally thousands of children who are, at least temporarily, orphans, into derelict shopping malls, empty hotels, and disused office complexes—outweighs the potential cleverness of finding, hidden in plain sight, an architectural resource ripe for humanitarian reuse. </p>
<p> <img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 5px; text-align:center;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lawless2.jpg" width="535" height="356" /><small>[Image: Photo by <a href="http://sephlawless.com">Seph Lawless</a>, from his book <a href="http://www.sephlawless-shop.com/product/autopsy-of-america"><i>Autopsy of America</i></a>].</small></p>
<p> As FEMA themselves make clear, such facilities are only useful if they are already outfitted with showers and bathrooms, among other bare necessities; retrofitting them for this purpose, while knowing that the day you need to put those showers to use might never arrive, would be both financially improbable and ominously permanent. </p>
<p> More optimistically, however, consider the case of dual-use infrastructure as put to use during events of mass quarantine. As Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, explained in a joint interview with BLDGBLOG and <i>Edible Geography</i> back in 2009, large architectural complexes not only <i>can</i> be designed for these sorts of secondary uses, but <a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2009/10/isolation-or-quarantine-an-interview-with-dr-georges-benjamin/">it&#8217;s actually a very good idea to do so</a>. <Br><Br> While Benjamin&#8217;s primary example in that interview was a sports stadium outfitted for secondary use as a quarantine ward or post-earthquake gathering place, you could quite easily imagine entire shopping malls being designed such that they could be repurposed, with minor fuss, as de facto community centers following major events of social upheaval. <br /><BR> After all, many of today&#8217;s malls, schools, airports, and office complexes already contain—or even double as—tornado shelters. Surely, FEMA&#8217;s proposal is just a more ambitious continuation of this idea, scaling it up to the point that housing 500 children in an abandoned Circuit City would actually make architectural sense? If successful, it would give the idea of &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033798/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0262033798&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=SD6E72XYWMXRR2T7">big box reuse</a>&#8221; a whole new valance.</p>
<p> Yet the reality of this threatens to be far less polished than such a speculative vision might otherwise suggest. <br /><Br> Indeed, it&#8217;s hard to shake the feeling that this could become a clear case of good architectural intentions gone surreally awry. We might well create one of the emptiest childhood experiences imaginable, a Ballardian architectural prism through which eventually tens of thousands of &#8220;unaccompanied minors&#8221; would be filtered into something vaguely resembling adulthood. Unaccompanied minors, raised by abandoned malls.<br /><Br> <img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 5px; text-align:center;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lawless3.jpg" width="535" height="356" /><small>[Image: Photo by <a href="http://sephlawless.com">Seph Lawless</a>, from his book <a href="http://www.sephlawless-shop.com/product/autopsy-of-america"><i>Autopsy of America</i></a>].</small></p>
<p> In any case, the ill-conceived plans don&#8217;t end there. </p>
<p> As the Syrian refugee crisis accelerated over the past two months, the idea of <a href="http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/blogs/norwegian-politicians-propose-housing-refugees-remote-arctic-archipelago">housing refugees on Svalbard</a>—a sparsely populated archipelago north of the Arctic Circle, known not for its strong sociopolitical infrastructure but for its polar bears—was suggested by Norwegian politicians. </p>
<p> Exactly how Svalbard would be transformed overnight into a land of economic opportunity was not discussed as part of the plan—although, unbelievably, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/14/refugee-crisis-svalbard-norway_n_8132314.html"><i>coal mining</i></a> was suggested as one possible route toward assimilation and success.</p>
<p> Moving broken families from the Middle East to what is, in effect, the North Pole so that they can mine coal there in an impossibly remote frozen landscape surrounded by polar bears sounds like something Josef Stalin would have come up with, lending even more of an air of unexpected inhumanity to these so-called &#8220;plans.&#8221; <br /><Br> But a third option, while seeming at first to be the most sensible example of this sub-genre of human chess, is possibly the strangest. &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/15/opinion/let-syrians-settle-detroit.html">Let The Syrians Settle Detroit</a>,&#8221; an op-ed for <i>The New York Times</i> suggested last month. The underlying logic is sound: the city&#8217;s population has plummeted, there is already a strong Muslim community in Michigan, and refugees very often exhibit strong entrepreneurial tendencies.<br /><Br> So far, so good.</p>
<p> <img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 5px; text-align:center;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Abandoned_Packard_Automobile_Factory_Detroit_200.jpg" width="535" height="356" /><small>[Image: Abandoned Packard plant in Detroit, via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Detroit">Wikipedia</a>].</small></p>
<p> On the other hand, if Detroit&#8217;s only problem was population, then other people would already be moving back to fill that city&#8217;s wide-open economic niches; in fact, this has been the purported goal of many recent programs aimed at inspiring millennial artists and entrepreneurs to move there from overpriced cities such as San Francisco and Brooklyn and &#8220;revitalize&#8221; the region, an aim not without its own complex racial and political complications.<br /><Br> Worse, though, Detroit was not carefully moth-balled and set aside with packing tape for future generations simply to move in and reclaim it. It&#8217;s not a turn-key urban fantasy lying in wait for someone to come back, flip a switch, and turn the lights—and the police, and the fire departments, and the healthcare—back on. Its infrastructure is in decline; its streetlights and <a href="http://fusion.net/story/141170/detroit-is-starting-to-shut-off-peoples-water-again/">even its water supply</a> are gradually being shut off; its houses are being torn down by the hundreds.<br /><Br> Randomly settling 50,000 Syrian refugees there straight from a war zone would mean depositing people in a condition of notoriously rapid urban decline, without any real cultural or economic context in which to orient themselves.<BR><br /> My own suggestion here is not in any way that a war zone in the Middle East would be preferable to living in Detroit—although it is worth noting that the premise of this program is precisely that <i>only people fleeing war</i> would want to live there. <br /><Br> However, people aren&#8217;t just game pieces you move from one place to another, swept up by your own architectural cleverness. If they were, well, then let&#8217;s put refugees on abandoned oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, or move them all to <a href="http://pruned.blogspot.com/2006/01/helltown-usa.html">Centralia</a>, gas masks thrown in for free. Let&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-29/man-camp-exodus-spurs-real-estate-crisis-across-u-s-shale-towns">settle them in abandoned trailers</a> as fracking &#8220;man camps&#8221; go empty.<br /><Br> Realizing that something is currently uninhabited does not mean that you can just fill it with human beings and expect a new society to take root. This is a geometric exercise—an experiment in space-packing—not a humanitarian plan. </p>
<p> Finding new homes—whether or not this &#8220;solves&#8221; the underlying geopolitical problem—is morally and economically necessary, and it will benefit everyone; but turning involuntary mass migration into a new form of architectural science fiction is not the way to go.</p>

		<p><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 5px; text-align:center;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BurglarEntersHouse.jpg" width="535" height="717" /><small>[Image: &#8220;How The Burglar Gets Into Your House&#8221; (1903), via <a href="http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/85088078/"><i>The Saint Paul Globe</i></a>].</small></p>
<p> One unfortunate side-effect of the Greek financial crisis has been a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/world/europe/greek-debt-crisis-adds-to-a-spike-in-burglaries-and-robberies.html">rise in domestic burglaries</a>. This has been inspired not only by a desperate response to bad economic times, but by the fact that many people have withdrawn their cash from banks and are now storing their cash at home. </p>
<p> As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/world/europe/greek-debt-crisis-adds-to-a-spike-in-burglaries-and-robberies.html"><i>The New York Times</i></A> reported at the end of July, &#8220;in the weeks before capital controls were imposed at the end of June, billions of euros fled the Greek banking system. Greeks feared that their euro deposits might be automatically converted to a new currency if Greece left the eurozone and would quickly lose value, or that they would face a &#8216;haircut&#8217; to their accounts if their bank failed amid the stresses of the crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p> This had the effect that, while the rich simply shifted their assets overseas or into Swiss bank accounts, &#8220;the middle class has stashed not just cash but gold and jewelry, among other valuables, under the proverbial mattress.&#8221; Now, however, those &#8220;hidden valuables had become enticing targets for thieves.&#8221; </p>
<p> Or, more accurately, for <i>burglars</i>. </p>
<p> Burglary <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/aburglarsguidetothecity/geoffmanaugh">is a spatial crime</a>: its very definition requires architecture. By entering an architectural space, whether it&#8217;s a screened-in porch or a megamansion, <i>theft</i> or petty larceny becomes <i>burglary</i>, a spatially defined offense that cannot take place without walls and a roof. <br /><Br> <img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 5px; text-align:center;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/athens.jpg" width="535" height="535" /><small>[Image: A street in Athens, via <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Herodou_Attikou_Street_Athens.JPG/1280px-Herodou_Attikou_Street_Athens.JPG">Wikipedia</a>].</small></p>
<p> In any case, while Greece sees its burglary rate go up and reports of local break-ins rise, home fortification has also picked up pace. &#8220;Many apartment doors have sprouted new security locks with heavy metal plates, similar to the locks used in safes,&#8221; we read, and razor wire now &#8220;bristles from garden gates where there were none last summer.&#8221; <br /><Br> This vision of DIY security measures applied to high-rise residential towers and other housing blocks in Athens is a surprising one, considering that, globally, burglary is in such decline that <i>The Economist</i> ran an article a few years ago asking, &#8220;<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21582041-rich-world-seeing-less-and-less-crime-even-face-high-unemployment-and-economic">Where have all the burglars gone?</a>&#8221; </p>
<p> As it happens, I&#8217;ve been studying burglary for the past few years for many reasons; among those is the fact that burglary offers insights into otherwise overlooked possibilities for reading and navigating urban and architectural space. <Br><Br> Indeed, burglary&#8217;s architectural interest comes not from its ubiquity, but from its unexpected, often surprisingly subtle misuse of the built environment. Burglars approach buildings differently, often seeking modes of entry other than doors and approaching buildings—whole cites—as if they&#8217;re puzzles waiting to be solved or beaten.<br /><Br> Consider the recent case of Formula 1 driver Jenson Button, whose villa in the south of France was broken into; the burglars allegedly made their entrance <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-33814823">after sending anesthetic gas through the home&#8217;s air-conditioning system</a>, incapacitating Button and his wife.<br /><Br> Although the BBC reports some convincing skepticism about Button&#8217;s claim, Button&#8217;s own spokesperson insists that this method of entry is on the rise: &#8220;The police have indicated that this has become a growing problem in the region,&#8221; the spokesperson said, &#8220;with perpetrators going so far as to gas their proposed victims through the air conditioning units before breaking in.&#8221;<Br><br /> There are other supposed examples of this sort of attack. Also <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-33821661">from the BBC</a>:   </p>
<blockquote><p>Former Arsenal footballer Patrick Vieira said he and his family were knocked out by gas during a 2006 raid on their home in Cannes. And in 2002, British television stars Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine said they were gassed while attending the Cannes Film Festival.<br /><Br>Other accounts, particularly from France, have appeared in the media over the past 15 years or so, describing people waking up groggy to discover they slept through a raid.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, on the other hand, that actual proof of these home gas attacks is lacking; what&#8217;s more, the amount of anesthetic needed to knock out multiple adults in a large architectural space is prohibitively expensive to obtain and also presents a high risk of explosion. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, a security firm called <a href="http://www.srx-group.com">SRX</a> has commented on the matter, saying to the BBC that this is a real risk and even pointing out the specific vulnerability: ventilation intake fans usually found on the perimeter of a property, where they can be visually and acoustically shielded in the landscaping.<Br><Br> Their very inconspicuousness also &#8220;makes them ideal for burglars,&#8221; however, as homeowners can neither see nor hear if someone is tampering with them; as SRX points out, &#8220;we have to try and prevent access to those fans.&#8221;<br /><Br> Fortified air-conditioning intake fans. Razor wire defensive cordons on urban balconies. Reinforced front doors like something you&#8217;d find on a safe or vault.<br /><Br> <img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 5px; text-align:center;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/acunit.jpg" width="535" height="340" /> <small>[Image: A totally random shot of A/C units, via <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/2008-07-11_Air_conditioners_at_UNC-CH.jpg">Wikipedia</a>].</small><br /><Br> The subject of burglary, break-ins, and home fortification interests me enough that <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/aburglarsguidetothecity/geoffmanaugh">I&#8217;ve written an entire book about it</a>—called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374117268/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0374117268&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=VJRMUVHPH7H64JU5"><i>A Burglar&#8217;s Guide to the City</i></a>, due out next spring from <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/fsg">FSG</a>—but it is also something I&#8217;ve addressed in an ongoing three-part series about domestic home security for <a href="http://www.dwell.com"><i>Dwell</i></a> magazine. <Br><Br> The second of those three articles is on newsstands now in the September 2015 issue, and it looks at the design and installation of safe rooms, more popularly known as <i>panic rooms</i>.<Br><Br> That article is not yet online—I&#8217;ll add a link when it&#8217;s up—but it includes interviews with safe room design experts on both U.S. coasts, as well as some interesting anecdotes about trends in home fortification, such as installing &#8220;lead-lined sheetrock to protect against radioactive attack.&#8221; Bullet-proof doors, rocket-propelled grenades, and home biometric security systems all make an unsettling appearance, as well. </p>
<p> Prior to that, in the July/August 2015 issue, I looked at technical vulnerabilities in smart home design. There, among other things, you can read that the &#8220;$20,000 smart-home upgrade you just paid for? <a href="http://www.dwell.com/post/article/how-secure-modern-smart-home-we-ask-professional">It can now be nullified for about $400</a>,&#8221; using a wallet-size device engineered by <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmRedShift">Drew Porter</a> of <a href="http://redmesa.io">Red Mesa</a>. <Br><Br> Further, you&#8217;ll learn how &#8220;<a href="http://www.dwell.com/post/article/childrens-toy-could-potentially-break-your-house">specific combinations of remote-control children’s toys could be hacked by ambitious burglars</a> to do everything from watching you leave on your next vacation to searching your home for hidden valuables.&#8221; That&#8217;s all <a href="http://www.dwell.com/people/geoff-manaugh">available online</a>.</p>
<p> The final article in that three-part series comes out in the October 2015 issue. Check them all out, if you get a chance, and then don&#8217;t forget to pick up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374117268/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0374117268&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=VJRMUVHPH7H64JU5"><i>A Burglar&#8217;s Guide</a> <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/aburglarsguidetothecity/geoffmanaugh">to the City</i></a> next spring.</p>
