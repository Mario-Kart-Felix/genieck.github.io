		<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/casparfriedrice.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderer_above_the_Sea_of_Fog"><em>Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer</em></a> by Caspar David Friedrich (c. 1818).]</small></p>
<p>It would be interesting to look at locations of the American popular imagination, as seen in movies and TV, mapped against regional tax breaks for the film industry. </p>
<p>There was a brief span of time, for example, when rural Pennsylvania stood in for <em>authentic Americana</em>, a kind of Rust Belt imaginary, all pick-up trucks and hard-drinking younger brothers, stories framed against the hulking ruins of industrial landscapes—I’m thinking of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_Furnace"><em>Out Of The Furnace</em></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_(2013_film)"><em>Prisoners</em></a>, both released in 2013, or even 2010’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstoppable_(2010_film)"><em>Unstoppable</em></a>. Whereas, today, Georgia seems to have stepped into that niche, between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsider_(miniseries)"><em>The Outsider</em></a> and, say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindhunter_(TV_series)"><em>Mindhunter</em></a> (season two), let alone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_(TV_series)"><em>Atlanta</em></a>, no doubt precisely because Georgia has <a href="https://variety.com/2018/film/features/georgias-production-incentives-seal-the-deal-for-hollywood-1202990450/">well-known tax incentives</a> in place for filming. </p>
<p>My point is that an entire generation of people—not just Americans, but film viewers and coronavirus quarantine streamers and TV binge-watchers around the world—might have their imaginative landscapes shaped not by immaterial forces, by symbolic archetypes or universal rules bubbling up from the high-pressure depths of human psychology, but instead by tax breaks offered in particular U.S. states at particular moments in American history. </p>
<p>You grow up thinking about Gothic pine forests, or you fall asleep at night with visions of rain-soaked Georgia parking lots crowding your head, but it’s not just because of the aesthetic or atmospheric appeal of those landscapes; it’s because those landscapes are, in effect, receiving imaginative subsidies from local business bureaus. You’re dreaming of them for a reason.</p>
<p>Your mind is not immaterial, in other words, some angelic force waltzing across the surface of the world, stopping now and again to dwell on universal imagery, but something deeply mundane, something sculpted by ridiculous things, like whether or not camera crews in a given state get hotel room discounts for productions lasting more than two weeks.</p>
<p>Of course, you could extend a similar kind of analysis way back into art history and look at, say, the opening of particular landscapes in western Europe, after decades of war, suddenly made safe for cultured travelers such as Caspar David Friedrich, whose paintings later came to define an entire era of European and European-descended male imaginations. That <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderer_above_the_Sea_of_Fog">wanderer over a sea of fog</a>, in other words, was wandering through a very specific landscape during a very particular window of European political accessibility. Had things been different, had history taken a slightly different path, Friedrich might have been stuck in his parents’ house, painting still-lives and weed-choked alleyways, and who knows what images today’s solo hikers might be daydreaming about instead.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/outsider.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: From <a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-outsider"><em>The Outsider</em></a>, courtesy <a href="https://www.hbo.com/">HBO</a>; I should mention that <em>The Outsider</em> was set and filmed primarily in Georgia, a departure from Stephen King’s novel, which was primarily set in Oklahoma.]</small></p>
<p>In any case, the humid forests of rural America, the looming water towers and abandoned industrial facilities, the kudzu-covered strip malls and furloughed police stations—picture the Louisianan expanses of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective"><em>True Detective</em></a> (season one)—have come to represent the dark narrative potential of the contemporary world. But what if, say, North Dakota or Manitoba (where, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grudge_(2020_film)"><em>The Grudge</em></a> was recently filmed) had offered better tax breaks? </p>
<p>My own childhood imagination was a world of sunlit suburbs, detached single-family homes, and long-shadowed neighborhood secrets, but, as to my larger point here, I also grew up watching movies like <em>E.T.</em>, <em>Poltergeist</em>, <em>Fright Night</em>, and <em>Blue Velvet</em>—so, in a sense, <em>of course</em> I would think that’s what the world looked like. </p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bluevelveeta.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: From David Lynch’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Velvet_(film)"><em>Blue Velvet</em></a> (1986), specifically via the site <a href="https://velveteyes.net/movie-stills/blue-velvet/">Velvet Eyes</a>.]</small></p>
<p>So, again, it would be interesting to explore how one’s vision of the world—your most fundamental imagination of the cosmos—is being shaped for you by tax breaks, film incentives, and other, utterly trivial local concerns, like whether or not out-of-state catering companies can get refunds on expenditures over a certain amount or where actors can write off per diems as gifts, not income, affecting whether crime films or horror stories will be shot there, and thus where an entire generation’s future nightmares might be set. </p>
<p>Or, for that matter, you could look at when particular colors, paints, and pigments became affordable for artists of a certain era, resulting in all those dark and moody images you love to stare at in the local museum—e.g. the old joke that, at some point, Rembrandt simply bought too much purple. It wasn’t promethean inspiration; it was material surplus.</p>
<p>We see things for a reason, yet, over and over again, mistake our dreams for signs of the cosmic. Or, to put this another way, we are not surrounded by mythology; we are surrounded by economics. The latter is a superb and confusing mimic.</p>

<p>Artist <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/kylie-white-cv">Kylie White</a> has two new pieces up in a group show here in Los Angeles, called <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/group-exhibition-grammars-of-creation"><em>Grammars of Creation</em></a>, on display at <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/">Moskowitz Bayse</a> till March 16th, which I will return to in a second. </p>
<p>White had a great solo show at the same gallery almost exactly a year ago, featuring a series of <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/kylie-white-six-significant-landscapes">geological faults modeled in richly veined, colored marble</a> Most also incorporated brass details, acting as so-called “Earth fasteners.” </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KylieWhite4.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KylieWhite5.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KylieWhite3.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Images: From <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/kylie-white-six-significant-landscapes"><em>Six Significant Landscapes</em></a> by Kylie White; photos courtesy <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/">Moskowitz Bayse</a>.]</small></p>
<p>Gallery text explained at the time that White’s works “are at once sculptures, scale models, geologic diagrams, and proposals; each depicts an active fault line, a place of displaced terrain due to tectonic movement.” </p>
<p>The “proposal” in each work, of course, would be the fasteners: metal implants of a sort meant to span the rift of an open fault. </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kyliewhite9.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: “Model of Earth Fastener on a Transform Fault; 1”=10” (2017) by Kylie White; note that this piece was not featured in <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/kylie-white-six-significant-landscapes"><em>Six Significant Landscapes</em></a>. Photo courtesy <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/">Moskowitz Bayse</a>.]</small></p>
<p>White’s fasteners seemed to suggest at least two things simultaneously: that perhaps we could fix the Earth’s surface in place, if only we had the means to stop faults from breaking open, but also that human interventions such as these, in otherwise colossal planetary landscapes, would be trivial at best, more sculptural than scientific, just temporary installations not permanent features of a changing continent.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kyliewhite8.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: From <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/kylie-white-six-significant-landscapes"><em>Six Significant Landscapes</em></a> by Kylie White; photo courtesy <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/">Moskowitz Bayse</a>.]</small></p>
<p>As I struggled to explain to my friends, however, while describing White’s work, the visual effect was strangely postmodern, almost tongue-in-cheek, as if her sculptures—all green marble blocks and inlaid brass—could have passed for avant-garde luxury furniture items from the 1980s (and, to be clear, I mean this in a good way: imagine scientific models masquerading as luxury goods).</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KylieWhite6.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kyliewhite7.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Images: Details from <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/kylie-white-six-significant-landscapes"><em>Six Significant Landscapes</em></a> by Kylie White; photos by BLDGBLOG.]</small></p>
<p>All of which means I sort of laughed when I saw these more recent works that seem to take this postmodern aesthetic to a new height, complete with two fault models mounted atop faux-Greek columns. </p>
<p><center><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kyliewhite2.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /></center><small>[Image: “Model of an Earth Fastener on the Hierapolis Fault (Plutonion)” (2019) by Kylie White; photo courtesy <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/">Moskowitz Bayse</a>.]</small></p>
<p>It’s like plate tectonics meets <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/learning-las-vegas-revised-edition"><em>Learning From Las Vegas</em></a>, by way of Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Because the columns are also a fitting reference to the pieces’ own subject matter: one, seen at the top of this post, is called “Model of an Earth Fastener on the Delphi Fault (Temple of Apollo)” and the other, immediately above, is “Model of an Earth Fastener on the Hierapolis Fault (Plutonion).” They perhaps suggest an entirely new approach to natural history museum displays—boldly gridded rooms filled with heroic blocks of the Earth’s surface, bathed in neon. Pomotectonics.</p>
<p>In any case, more information about the show is available at <a href="http://www.moskowitzbayse.com/group-exhibition-grammars-of-creation">Moskowitz Bayse</a>. It closes on March 16th, 2020, although White apparently has another, currently untitled solo show coming up in 2021.</p>

<p>It’s a slow morning, so perhaps the laziness of linking to Wikipedia can be excused&#8230; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immurement">Immurement</a> is “a form of imprisonment, usually for life, in which a person is placed within an enclosed space with no exits.” </p>
<p>In folklore and myth, “immurement is prominent as a form of capital punishment, but its use as a type of human sacrifice to make buildings sturdy has many tales attached to it as well. Skeletal remains have been, from time to time, found behind walls and in hidden rooms and on several occasions have been asserted to be evidence of such sacrificial practices or of such a form of punishment.” </p>
<p>In terms of literature and film, an obvious example would be Edgar Allan Poe’s short story, “<a href="https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/the_cask_of_amontillado.pdf">The Cask of Amontillado</a>,” but there was also an absolutely God-awful horror movie a few years ago called, yes, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104006/"><em>Walled In</em></a>. </p>
<p>The examples given by Wikipedia include a Moroccan serial killer sentenced to death in 1906 by being walled alive—or <em>immured</em>—and whose screams, inside the walls, were audible for two days; immurement as a tactic for military revenge; and a horrific photo of a woman “immured” inside a wooden crate with only her arm and head visible, left to die outside in Mongolia.</p>
<p>Vaguely related to this, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorite">anchorites</a> are self-isolated religious hermits, but ones who “take a vow of stability of place, opting instead for permanent enclosure in cells often attached to churches.” While not <em>immurement</em> in a technical sense, becoming an anchorite was nonetheless also a radical act of bodily enclosure, using architecture as an extreme kind of “stability of place,” a permanent habitation.</p>
<p>I suppose exile would be the opposite spatial condition, a state in which one is permanently disallowed from ever entering architecture, always locked outside. Walled <em>out</em>, as it were.</p>

<p>Artist <a href="http://www.sullivangoss.com/rico_Lebrun/">Rico Lebrun</a> once remarked that he was interested in “<a href="http://www.sullivangoss.com/rico_Lebrun/">changing what is disfigured into what is transfigured</a>,” aiming to depict “<a href="https://amzn.to/2NFMcZo">mineral and spiritual splendor</a>.”</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/391.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: “Figures in Black &#038; White” (ca. 1961) by Rico Lebrun, via <a href="https://www.mutualart.com/Artwork/FIGURES-IN-BLACK---WHITE/9AE76376D50A088F">Mutual Art</a>].</small></p>
<p>Originally from Naples, Italy, where he painted murals, Lebrun brought a macabre sense of body horror to classic myths and religious illustrations. Think of him as a kind of Italian-American version of <a href="http://nymag.com/arts/art/profiles/56786/index1.html">Francis Bacon</a>.</p>
<p>Lebrun has been described as “<a href="http://www.johnseed.com/2017/07/rico-lebrun-1900-1964-retrospective-is_8.html">one of the most unjustly neglected artists</a> of the postwar era&#8230; Lebrun’s last major exhibition was in 1967 and it was hastily thrown together. He has never had [a] critically curated retrospective that locates his art in its time and place, and neither has he had a scholarly monograph to take the measure of his career.” </p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/88ec3e477cf4088873a2ac50de7f725c.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: From <a href="https://amzn.to/2N1epZz"><em>Drawings for Dante’s Inferno by Rico Lebrun</em></a>, this is “Canto XXV—Circle Eight: Bolgia of the Thieves; their penance was to be changed from humans into snakes.” Via <a href="http://liblamp.uwm.edu/omeka/SPC2/exhibits/show/classictext/dante/lebrun">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a>].</small></p>
<p>What I find so interesting in Lebrun’s work is how sculptural and bloated anatomical forms become worlds unto themselves, divorced from their contexts. They are humid, planetary, often trapped in monstrous pregnancies or what could pass for ritualized medical events. Lebrun depicts Hell as a place of limitless metastasis and uncontrolled mutation.</p>

<p>In other images, broken skeletons seem to emerge from the wrong skin, people lump over one another as if grafted together in molten surgery, and limbs are splayed wide, almost pornographically, in tumbled piles of flesh. </p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/d38a9ec6f8f8e2f710ca4fcac1819386.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: From <a href="https://amzn.to/2N1epZz"><em>Drawings for Dante’s Inferno by Rico Lebrun</em></a>].</small></p>
<p>His most notable projects—including <a href="https://amzn.to/2N1epZz">illustrations for Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em></a>, scenes of <a href="https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_master-checklist_325766.pdf">the Crucifixion</a>, and a project focused on the Holocaust—all explored grotesque exaggerations of the human form, seeming to fuse multiple figures into one, even hybridizing animal bodies with the isolated suffering of people broken and betrayed by the world around them.</p>

<p>Serpents wrap around and consume doomed humans; writhing bodies seem frozen into stone atop tombs. </p>
<p>“Some are bloody,” he wrote <a href="https://amzn.to/2NFMcZo">in a letter to a friend</a>, describing his drawings for Dante’s <em>Inferno</em>, “and horrifying as the cantos in the Inferno are; there is no other way to depict terror as Dante describes it, without turning the whole thing into an assembly of sedately arranged figures having a picnic in a dark place&#8230;”</p>

<p>According to translator John Ciardi, “it is only Rico Lebrun who succeeds in giving me a <a href="http://liblamp.uwm.edu/omeka/SPC2/exhibits/show/classictext/dante/lebrun">graphic <em>Inferno</em></a>&#8230; Hell is not a Gothic cave, nor is it a festival of dance rhythms, nor is it a series of monkish miniatures. It is a concept.”</p>
<p>Lebrun <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/11/rico-lebrun-artist-63-dead.html">died in 1964</a>.</p>

<p>One of many things I love about writing—that is, engaging in writing as an activity—is how it facilitates a discovery of connections between otherwise unrelated things. Writing reveals and even relies upon analogies, metaphors, and unexpected similarities: there is resonance between a story in the news and a medieval European folktale, say, or between a photo taken in a war-wrecked city and an 18th-century landscape painting. These sorts of relations might remain dormant or unnoticed until writing brings them to the foreground: previously unconnected topics and themes begin to interact, developing meanings not present in those original subjects on their own. </p>
<p>Wildfires burning in the Arctic might bring to mind infernal images from <em>Paradise Lost</em> or even intimations of an unwritten J.G. Ballard novel, pushing a simple tale of natural disaster to new symbolic heights, something mythic and larger than the story at hand. Learning that U.S. Naval researchers on the Gulf Coast have used the marine slime of a “300-million-year old creature” <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/24/slime-300-million-year-old-creature-may-be-used-for-body-armor.html">to develop 21st-century body armor</a> might conjure images from classical mythology or even from H.P. Lovecraft: Neptunian biotech wed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_of_Cthulhu">Cthulhoid</a> military terror. </p>
<p>In other words, writing means that one thing can be crosswired or brought into contrast with another for the specific purpose of fueling further imaginative connections, new themes to be pulled apart and lengthened, teased out to form plots, characters, and scenes. </p>
<p>In addition, a writer of fiction might stage an otherwise straightforward storyline in an unexpected setting, in order to reveal something new about both. It’s a hard-boiled detective thriller—<a href="http://amzn.to/2zncMlI">set on an international space station</a>. It’s a heist film—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_(film)">set at the bottom of the sea</a>. It’s a procedural missing-person mystery—<a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2016/12/a-wall-of-walls/">set on a remote military base in Afghanistan</a>. </p>
<p>Thinking like a writer would mean asking why things have happened in this way and not another—in this <em>place</em> and not another—and to see what happens when you begin to switch things around. It’s about strategic recombination. </p>
<p>I mention all this after reading <a href="https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2">a new essay by artist and critic James Bridle</a> about algorithmic content generation as seen in children’s videos on YouTube. The piece is worth reading for yourself, but I wanted to highlight a few things here. </p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/eniac2.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Wiring the ENIAC; via <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/11/eniac-unearthed/"><em>Wired</em></a>]</small></p>
<p>In brief, the essay suggests that an increasingly odd, even nonsensical subcategory of children’s video is emerging on YouTube. The content of these videos, Bridle writes, comes from what he calls “keyword/hashtag association.” That is, popular keyword searches have become a stimulus for producing new videos whose content is reverse-engineered from those searches. </p>
<p>To use an entirely fictional example of what this means, let’s imagine that, following a popular <em>Saturday Night Live</em> sketch, millions of people begin Googling “Pokémon Go Ewan McGregor.” In the emerging YouTube media ecology that Bridle documents, someone with an entrepreneurial spirit would immediately make a <em>Pokémon Go</em> video featuring Ewan McGregor both to satisfy this peculiar cultural urge and to profit from the anticipated traffic. </p>
<p>Content-generation through keyword mixing is “a whole dark art unto itself,” Bridle suggests. As a particular keyword or hashtag begins to trend, “content producers pile onto it, creating thousands and thousands more of these videos in every possible iteration.” Imagine Ewan McGregor playing <em>Pokémon Go</em>, forever.</p>
<p>What’s unusual here, however, and what Bridle specifically highlights in his essay, is that this creative process is becoming <em>automated</em>: machine-learning algorithms are taking note of trending keyword searches or popular hashtag combinations, then recommending the production of content to match those otherwise arbitrary sets. For Bridle, the results verge on the incomprehensible—less Big Data, say, than Big <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/d/dada">Dada</a>.</p>
<p>This is by no means new. Recall the origin of <em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70178217">House of</a> <a href="http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/house-of-cards-kevin-spacey-uncertain-future-1202608528/">Cards</a></em> on Netflix. Netflix learned from its massive trove of consumer data that its customers liked, among other things, David Fincher films, political thrillers, and the actor Kevin Spacey. As David Carr explained for the <em>New York Times</em> back in 2013, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/business/media/for-house-of-cards-using-big-data-to-guarantee-its-popularity.html">this suggested the outline of a possible series</a>: “With those three circles of interest, Netflix was able to find a Venn diagram intersection that suggested that buying the series would be a very good bet on original programming.” </p>
<p>In other words, <em>House of Cards</em> was produced because it matched a data set, an example of “keyword/hashtag association” becoming video.</p>
<p>The question here would be: what if, instead of a human producer, a machine-learning algorithm had been tasked with analyzing Netflix consumer data and generating an idea for a new TV show? What if that recommendation algorithm didn’t quite understand which combinations would be good or worth watching? It’s not hard to imagine an unwatchably surreal, even uncanny television show resulting from this, something that seems to make more sense as a data-collection exercise than as a coherent plot—yet Bridle suggests that this is exactly what’s happening in the world of children’s videos online.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/metropolis.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film)"><em>Metropolis</em></a>].</small></p>
<p>In some of these videos, Bridle explains, keyword-based programming might mean something as basic as altering a few words in a script, then having actors playfully act out those new scenarios. Actors might incorporate new toys, new types of candy, or even a particular child’s name: “Matt” on a “donkey” at “the zoo” becomes “Matt” on a “horse” at “the zoo” becomes “Carla” on a “horse” at “home.” Each variant keyword combination then results in its own short video, and each of these videos can be monetized. Future such recombinations are infinite.</p>
<p>In an age of easily produced digital animations, Bridle adds, these sorts of keyword micro-variants can be produced both extremely quickly and very nearly automatically. Some YouTube producers have even eliminated “human actors” altogether, he writes, “to create infinite reconfigurable versions of the same videos over and over again. What is occurring here is clearly automated. Stock animations, audio tracks, and lists of keywords being assembled in their thousands to produce an endless stream of videos.” </p>
<p>Bridle notes with worry that it is nearly impossible here “to parse out the gap between human and machine.”</p>
<p>Going further, he suggests that the automated production of new videos based on popular search terms has resulted in scenes so troubling that children should not be exposed to them—but, interestingly, Bridle’s reaction here seems to be based on those videos’ <em>content</em>. That is, the videos feature animated characters appearing without heads, or kids being buried alive in sandboxes, or even the painful sounds of babies crying.</p>
<p>What I think is unsettling here is slightly different, on the other hand. The content, in my opinion, is simply strange: a kind of low-rent surrealism for kids, David Lynch-lite for toddlers. For thousands of years, western folktales have featured cannibals, incest, haunted houses, even John Carpenter-like biological transformations, from woman to tree, or from man to pig and back again. Children burn to death on chariots in the sky or sons fall from atmospheric heights into the sea. These myths seem more nightmarish—on the level of <em>content</em>—than some of Bridle’s chosen YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Instead, I would argue, what’s disturbing here is what the content suggests about <em>how things should be connected</em>. The real risk would seem to be that children exposed to recommendation algorithms at an early age might begin to emulate them cognitively, learning how to think, reason, and associate based on inhuman leaps of machine logic. </p>
<p>Bridle’s inability “to parse out the gap between human and machine” might soon apply not just to these sorts of YouTube videos but to the children who grew up watching them. </p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/replicant.jpeg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Replicants in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner"><em>Blade Runner</em></a>].</small></p>
<p>One of my favorite scenes in Umberto Eco’s novel <a href="http://amzn.to/2zlXzPq"><em>Foucault’s Pendulum</em></a> is when a character named Jacopo Belbo describes different types of people. Everyone in the world, Belbo suggests, is one of only four types: there are “cretins, fools, morons, and lunatics.” </p>
<p>In the context of the present discussion, it is interesting to note that these categories are defined by modes of reasoning. For example, “Fools don’t claim that cats bark,” Belbo explains, “but they talk about cats when everyone else is talking about dogs.” They get their references wrong. </p>
<p>It is Eco’s “lunatic,” however, who offers a particularly interesting character type for us to consider: the lunatic, we read, is “a moron who doesn’t know the ropes. The moron proves his [own] thesis; he has a logic, however twisted it may be. The lunatic, on the other hand, doesn’t concern himself at all with logic; he works by short circuits. For him, everything proves everything else. The lunatic is all <em>idée fixe</em>, and whatever he comes across confirms his lunacy. You can tell him by the liberties he takes with common sense, by his flashes of inspiration&#8230;” </p>
<p>It might soon be time to suggest a fifth category, something beyond the lunatic, where <em>thinking like an algorithm</em> becomes its own strange form of reasoning, an alien logic gradually accepted as human over two or three generations to come.</p>
<p>Assuming I have read Bridle’s essay correctly—and it is entirely possible I have not—he seems disturbed by the <em>content</em> of these videos. I think the more troubling aspect, however, is in <em>how they suggest kids should think</em>. They replace narrative reason with algorithmic recommendation, connecting events and objects in weird, illogical bursts lacking any semblance of internal coherence, where the sudden appearance of something completely irrelevant can nonetheless be explained because of its keyword-search frequency. Having a conversation with someone who thinks like this—who <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/05/23/donald-trump-speaking-style-interviews/">“thinks” like this</a>—would be utterly alien, if not logically impossible.  </p>
<p>So, to return to this post’s beginning, one of the thrills of thinking like a writer, so to speak, is precisely in how it encourages one to bring together things that might not otherwise belong on the same page, and to work toward understanding why these apparently unrelated subjects might secretly be connected. </p>
<p>But what is <em>thinking like an algorithm</em>? </p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if algorithmically assembled material can still offer the sort of interpretive challenge posed by narrative writing, or if the only appropriate response to the kinds of content Bridle describes will be passive resignation, indifference, knowing that a data set somewhere produced a series of keywords and that the story before you goes no deeper than that. So you simply watch the next video. And the next. And the next.</p>

<p>I got to hike with my friend Wayne last week through a place called the <a href="https://www.theoutbound.com/los-angeles/hiking/hike-devil-s-punchbowl-and-devil-s-chair">Devil’s Punchbowl</a>, initially by way of a trail out and back from a very <a href="https://www.caspardavidfriedrich.org/">Caspar David Friedrich-ian</a> overlook called the <a href="https://modernhiker.com/hike/hiking-the-devils-chair/">Devil’s Chair</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fault3.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Wayne, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BCckenfigur"><em>Rückenfigur</em></a>; photo by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bldgblog/">BLDGBLOG</a>].</small></p>
<p>The Punchbowl more or less lies astride the San Andreas Fault, and the Devil’s Chair, in particular, surveils this violently serrated landscape, like gazing out across exposed rows of jagged teeth—<em>terra dentata</em>—or perhaps the angled waves of a frozen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/19/hokusai-japanese-artist-late-blossoming-great-wave-mount-fuji">Hokusai painting</a>. The entire place seems charged with the seismic potential energy of an impending earthquake. </p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fault4.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: It is difficult to get a sense of scale from this image, but this geological feature alone is at least 100 feet in height, and it is only one of hundreds; photo by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bldgblog/">BLDGBLOG</a>].</small></p>
<p>The rocks themselves are enormous, splintered and looming sometimes hundreds of feet over your head, and in the heat-haze they almost seem buoyant, subtly bobbing up and down with your footsteps like the tips of drifting icebergs. </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fault6.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Looking out at the Devil’s Chair; photo by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bldgblog/">BLDGBLOG</a>].</small></p>
<p>In fact, we spent the better part of an hour wondering aloud how geologists could someday cause massive underground rock formations such as these to rise to the surface of the Earth, like shipwrecks pulled from the bottom of the sea. Rather than go to the minerals, in other words, geologists could simply bring the minerals to them. </p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fault2.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Photo by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bldgblog/">BLDGBLOG</a>].</small></p>
<p>Because of the angles of the rocks, however, it’s remarkably easy to hike out amidst them, into open, valley-like groins that have been produced by tens of thousands of years’ worth of rainfall and erosion; once there, you can just scramble up the sides, skirting past serpentine pores and small caves that seem like perfect resting spaces for snakes, till you reach sheer drop-offs at the top. </p>
<p>There, views open up of more and more—and more—of these same tilted rocks, leading on along the fault, marking the dividing line between continental plates and tempting even the most exhausted hiker further into the landscape. The problem with these sorts of cresting views is that they become addictive.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fault7.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Wayne, panoramically doubled; photo by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bldgblog/">BLDGBLOG</a>].</small></p>
<p>At the end of the day, we swung by the monastic community at <a href="https://www.saintandrewsabbey.com/">St. Andrew’s Abbey</a>, which is located essentially in the middle of the San Andreas Fault. Those of you who have read David Ulin’s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Solid-Ground-Earthquakes-Prediction/dp/0143035258//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=c3f5d0658192c5948e56ecdb80908e79"><em>The Myth of Solid Ground</em></a> will recall the strange relationship Ulin explores connecting superstition, faith, folk science, and popular seismology amongst people living in an earthquake zone.</p>
<p>Even more specifically, you might recall a man Ulin mentions who once claimed that, hidden “in the pattern of the L.A freeway system, there is an apparition of a dove whose presence serves to restrain ‘the forces of the San Andreas fault’.” </p>
<p>This is scientifically cringeworthy, to be sure, but it is nonetheless interesting in revealing how <a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2015/10/occult-infrastructure-and-the-funerary-teleportation-grid-of-greater-london/">contemporary infrastructure can become wrapped up in emergent mythologies</a> of how the world (supposedly) works. </p>
<p>The idea, then, of a rogue seismic abbey quietly established in a remote mountainous region of California “to restrain ‘the forces of the San Andreas Fault’”—which, to be clear, is not the professed purpose of St. Andrew’s Abbey—is an idea worth exploring in more detail, in another medium. Imagine monks, praying every night to keep the rocks below them still, titanic geological forces lulled into a state of quiescent slumber. </p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vasquez.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Vasquez Rocks at sunset; photo by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bldgblog/">BLDGBLOG</a>].</small></p>
<p>In fact, I lied: at the actual end of the day, Wayne and I split up and I drove back to Los Angeles alone by way of a sunset hike at <a href="https://modernhiker.com/hike/hiking-vasquez-rocks/">Vasquez Rocks</a>, a place <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-star-trek-50-vasquez-rocks-20160829-snap-story.html">familiar to <em>Star Trek</em> fans</a>, where rock formations nearly identical to—but also less impressive than—the Devil’s Punchbowl breach the surface of the Earth like dorsal fins. The views, as you’d expect, were spectacular.</p>
<p>Both parks—not to mention St. Andrew’s Abbey—are within easy driving distance of Los Angeles, and both are worth a visit. </p>

<p>Washington D.C. is surrounded by a diamond of “<a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/maps/2017/05/modest-monuments-the-district-of-columbia-boundary-stones/">boundary stones</a>,” Tim St. Onge writes for the Library of Congress blog, <a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/maps/"><em>Worlds Revealed</em></a>. </p>
<p>“The oldest set of federally placed monuments in the United States are strewn along busy streets, hidden in dense forests, lying unassumingly in residential front yards and church parking lots,” he explains. “Many are fortified by small iron fences, and one resides in the sea wall of a Potomac River lighthouse. Lining the current and former boundaries of Washington, D.C., these are the boundary stones of our nation’s capital.” </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/boundarystone.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: “District of Columbia boundary stone,” <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/hec2013012408">U.S. Library of Congress</a>].</small></p>
<p>Nearly all of them—36 out of 40—can still be found today, although they are not necessarily easy to identify. “Some stones legibly maintain their original inscriptions marking the ‘Jurisdiction of the United States,’ while others have been severely eroded or sunk into the ground so as to now resemble ordinary, naturally-occurring stones.” They have been hit by cars and obscured by poison ivy.</p>
<p>The question of who owns the stones—and thus has responsibility for preserving them—is complex, as the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2014/08/29/d-c-s-historic-boundary-stones-are-being-preserved"><em>Washington Post</em></a> pointed out back in 2014. “Those that sit on the D.C./Maryland line were deemed the property of the D.C. Department of Transportation. ‘But on the Virginia side, if you own the land, you own the stone,’ [Stephen Powers of <a href="http://www.boundarystones.org/">boundarystones.org</a>] says.”</p>

<p>Novelist <a href="http://jeremypbushnell.com/">Jeremy Bushnell</a> joked on Twitter that, “if anyone knows the incantations that correctly activate these, <a href="https://twitter.com/jbushnell/status/865263138492604417">now would be a good time to utter them</a>,” and, indeed, there is something vaguely magical—in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasure_(film)">Nicolas Cage</a> sort of way—in this vision of the nation’s capital encaged by a <a href="http://bldgblog.com/2017/03/spells-against-autonomy/">protective geometry</a> of aging obelisks. Whether “activating” them would have beneficial or nefarious ends, I suppose, is something that remains to be seen. </p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.ma1118.photos/?sp=1&#038;st=gallery">Boston also has its boundary stones</a>, and the “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/3C1_IftBJe/?taken-by=nathanmasters">original city limits</a>” of Los Angeles apparently have a somewhat anticlimactic little marker that you can find driven into the concrete, as well.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.sonicacts.com/portal/archive/Alastair-Reynolds-White-Noise">a talk delivered in Amsterdam</a> a few years ago, science fiction writer Alastair Reynolds outlined an unnerving future scenario for the universe, something he had also recently used as the premise of a short story (collected <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Solaris-Rising-Book-Science-Fiction/dp/190799209X//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=8283e367777e89d7047ea7a3d8f4e3a9">here</a>). </p>
<p>As the universe expands over hundreds of billions of years, Reynolds explained, there will be a point, in the very far future, at which all galaxies will be so far apart that they will no longer be visible from one another. </p>
<p>Upon reaching that moment, it will no longer be possible to understand the universe’s history—or perhaps even that it had one—as all evidence of a broader cosmos outside of one’s own galaxy will have forever disappeared. Cosmology itself will be impossible. </p>
<p>In such a radically expanded future universe, Reynolds continued, some of the most basic insights offered by today’s astronomy will be unavailable. After all, he points out, “you can’t measure the redshift of galaxies if you can’t see galaxies. And if you can’t see galaxies, how do you even know that the universe is expanding? How would you ever determine that the universe had had an origin?” </p>
<p>There would be no reason to theorize that other galaxies had ever existed in the first place. The universe, in effect, will have disappeared over its own horizon, into a state of irreversible amnesia.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HubbleTarantulaNebula.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: The Tarantula Nebula, photographed by the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/index.html">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, via the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/23/science/space/unforgettable-hubble-space-telescope-photos.html"><em>New York Times</em></a>].</small></p>
<p>It was an <a href="http://www.sonicacts.com/portal/archive/Alastair-Reynolds-White-Noise">interesting talk</a> that I had the pleasure to catch in person, and, for those interested, it includes Reynolds’s explanation of how he shaped this idea into a short story. </p>
<p>More to the point, however, Reynolds was originally inspired by an article published in <em>Scientific American</em> back in 2008 called “<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-end-of-cosmology/">The End of Cosmology?</a>” by Lawrence M. Krauss and Robert J. Scherrer. </p>
<p>That article’s sub-head suggests what’s at stake: “An accelerating universe,” we read, “wipes out traces of its own origins.”</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hubblebubble.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: A “<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2016/hubbles-blue-bubble">Wolf–Rayet star&#8230; in the constellation of Carina</a> (The Keel),” photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope].</small> </p>
<p>As Krauss and Scherrer point out in their provocative essay, “We may be living in the only epoch in the history of the universe when scientists can achieve an accurate understanding of the true nature of the universe.” </p>
<p>“What will the scientists of the future see as they peer into the skies 100 billion years from now?” they ask. “Without telescopes, they will see pretty much what we see today: the stars of our galaxy&#8230; The big difference will occur when these future scientists build telescopes capable of detecting galaxies outside our own. They won’t see any! The nearby galaxies will have merged with the Milky Way to form one large galaxy, and essentially all the other galaxies will be long gone, having escaped beyond the event horizon.”</p>
<p>This won’t only mean fewer luminous objects to see in space; it will mean that, “as a result, Hubble’s crucial discovery of the expanding universe will become irreproducible.”</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hubbleArp273.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: The “interacting galaxies” of Arp 273, photographed by the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/index.html">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, via the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html"><em>New York Times</em></a>].</small></p>
<p>The authors go on to explain that even the chemical composition of this future universe will no longer allow for its history to be deduced, including the Big Bang. </p>
<p>“Astronomers and physicists who develop an understanding of nuclear physics,” they write, “will correctly conclude that stars burn nuclear fuel. If they then conclude (incorrectly) that all the helium they observe was produced in earlier generations of stars, they will be able to place an upper limit on the age of the universe. These scientists will thus correctly infer that their galactic universe is not eternal but has a finite age. Yet the origin of the matter they observe will remain shrouded in mystery.” </p>
<p>In other words, essentially no observational tool available to future astronomers will lead to an accurate understanding of the universe’s origins. The authors call this an “apocalypse of knowledge.”</p>

<p>There are many interesting things here, including the somewhat existentially horrifying possibility that any intelligent creatures alive in that distant era will have no way to know what is happening to them, where things came from, even where they currently are (an empty space? a dream?), or why. </p>
<p>Informed cosmology will, by necessity, be replaced with religious speculation—with myths, poetry, and folklore. </p>

<p>It is worth asking, however briefly and with multiple grains of salt, if something similar has perhaps already occurred in the universe we think we know today—if something has not already disappeared beyond the horizon of cosmic amnesia—making even our most well-structured, observation-based theories obsolete. For example, could even the widely accepted conclusion that there was a Big Bang be just an ironic side-effect of having lost some other form of cosmic evidence that long ago slipped eternally away from view? </p>
<p>Remember that these future astronomers <em>will not know anything is missing</em>. They will merrily forge ahead with their own complicated, internally convincing new theories and tests. It is not out of the question, then, to ask if we might be in a similarly ignorant situation. </p>
<p>In any case, what kinds of future devices and instruments might be invented to measure or explore a cosmic scenario such as this? What explanations and narratives would such devices be trying to prove?</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/astro5creation.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: “Woodcut illustration depicting the 7th day of Creation, from a page of the 1493 Latin edition of Schedel’s <em>Nuremberg Chronicle</em>.

<p>Science writer Sarah Scoles looked at this same dilemma last year for PBS, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/physics/physics-in-1-trillion-years/">interviewing astronomer Avi Loeb</a>. </p>
<p>Scoles was able to find a small glimmer of light in this infinite future darkness, however: Loeb believes that there might actually be a way out of this universal amnesia. </p>
<blockquote><p>“The center of our galaxy keeps ejecting stars at high enough speeds that they can exit the galaxy,” Loeb says. The intense and dynamic gravity near the black hole ejects them into space, where they will glide away forever like radiating rocket ships. The same thing should happen a trillion years from now.</p>
<p>“These stars that leave the galaxy will be carried away by the same cosmic acceleration,” Loeb says. Future astronomers can monitor them as they depart. They will see stars leave, become alone in extragalactic space, and begin rushing faster and faster toward nothingness. It would look like magic. But if those future people dig into that strangeness, they will catch a glimpse of the true nature of the universe.</p></blockquote>
<p>There might yet be hope for cosmological discovery, in the other words, encoded in the trajectories of these bizarre, fleeing stars. </p>

<p>There are at least two reasons why I have been thinking about this today. One was the publication of an article by Dennis Overbye earlier this week about the rate of the universe’s expansion. </p>
<p>“There is a crisis brewing in the cosmos,” Overbye writes, “or perhaps in the community of cosmologists. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html">The universe seems to be expanding too fast</a>, some astronomers say.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the universe might be more “virulent and controversial” than currently believed, he explains, caught-up in the long process of simply tearing itself apart. </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/starburst.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: A “<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2016/hubble-spots-a-secluded-starburst-galaxy">starburst galaxy</a>” photographed by the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/index.html">Hubble Space Telescope</a>].</small> </p>
<p>One implication of this finding, Overbye adds, “is that the most popular version of dark energy—known as the cosmological constant, invented by Einstein 100 years ago and then rejected as a blunder—might have to be replaced in the cosmological model by a more virulent and controversial form known as phantom energy, which could cause the universe to eventually expand so fast that even atoms would be torn apart in a Big Rip billions of years from now.”</p>
<p>In the process, perhaps the far-future dark ages envisioned by Krauss and Scherrer will thus arrive a billion or two years earlier than expected. </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/divine.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Engraving by Gustave Doré from <a href="https://archive.org/details/thedivinecomedyb08800gut"><em>The Divine Comedy</em></a> by Dante Alighieri].</small></p>
<p>The second thing that made me think of this, however, was a short essay called “<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1963JRASC..57..210S">Dante in Orbit</a>,” originally published in 1963, that a friend sent to me last night. It is about stars, constellations, and the possibility of determining astronomical time in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Comedy-Purgatorio-Paradiso-Everymans/dp/0679433139//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=aa488f4a25d2e4601d0cb61eb594dbfa"><em>The Divine Comedy</em></a>.</p>
<p>In that paper, Frederick A. Stebbins writes that Dante “seems far removed from the space age; yet we find him concerned with problems of astronomy that had no practical importance until man went into orbit. He had occasion to deal with local time, elapsed time, and the International Date Line. His solutions appear to be correct.” </p>
<p>Stebbins goes on to describe “numerous astronomical references in [Dante’s] chief work, <em>The Divine Comedy</em>”—albeit doing so in a way that remains unconvincing. He suggests, for example, that Dante’s descriptions of constellations, sunrises, full moons, and more will allow an astute reader to measure exactly how much time was meant to have passed in his mythic story, and even that Dante himself had somehow been aware of differential, or relativistic, time differences between far-flung locations. (Recall, on the other hand, that Dante’s work has been discussed elsewhere <a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2016/02/the-physics-of-hell/">for its possible insights into physics</a>.)</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DanteOrbit.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Diagrams from “<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1963JRASC..57..210S">Dante in Orbit</a>” (1963) by Frederick A. Stebbins].</small></p>
<p>But what’s interesting about this is not whether or not Stebbins was correct in his conclusions. What’s interesting is the very idea that a medieval cosmology might have been soft-wired, so to speak, into Dante’s poetic universe and that the stars and constellations he referred to would have had clear narrative significance for contemporary readers. It was part of their era’s shared understanding of how the world was structured. </p>
<p>Now, though, imagine some new Dante of a hundred billion years from now—some new <em>Divine Comedy</em> published in a trillion years—and how it might come to grips with the universal isolation and darkness of Krauss and Scherrer. What cycles of time might be perceived in the lonely, shining bulk of the Milky Way, a dying glow with no neighbor; what shared folklore about the growing darkness might be communicated to readers who don’t know, who cannot know, how incorrect their model of the cosmos truly is?</p>

<p>As cities like New York prepare for “<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-greater-new-york-city-region-must-plan-for-permanent-flooding">permanent flooding</a>,” and as we remember submerged historical landscapes such as Doggerland, <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-lost-civilisations-under-the-waves-still-fascinate-us">lost beneath the waves of a rising North Sea</a>, it’s interesting to read that humanity’s ancient past—not just its looming future—might be fundamentally maritime, rather than landlocked. Or oceanic rather than terrestrial, we might say. </p>
<p>In his recent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Human-Shore-Seacoasts-History/dp/0226922235//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=9be3d46648919782ba88747739cdac0d"><em>The Human Shore</em></a>, historian John R. Gillis suggests that, due to a variety of factors, including often extreme transportation difficulties presented by inland terrain, traveling by sea was the obvious choice for early human migrants. </p>
<p>People, after all, have been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/science/16archeo.html">seafaring for at least 130,000 years</a>. </p>
<p>This focus on seas and waterways came with political implications, Gillis writes. Even when European merchant-explorers reached North America, “It would be a very long time, almost three hundred years, before Europeans realized the full extent of the Americas’ continental character and grasped the fact that they might have to abandon the ways of seaborne empires for those of territorial states.” In fact, he adds, “for the first century or more, northern Europeans showed more interest in navigational rights to certain waterways and sea tenures than in territorial possession as such.”</p>
<p>At the risk of anachronism, you might say that their power was defined by logistical concerns, rather than by territorial ones: by dynamic, just-in-time access to ports and routes, rather than by the stationary establishment of landed borders and policed frontiers.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/turner1.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <small>[Image: “<a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-ship-in-a-storm-t05726">Ship in a Storm</a>” (ca. 1826), by Joseph Mallord William Turner; courtesy <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-ship-in-a-storm-t05726">Tate Britain</a>].</small></p>
<p>Gillis goes much further than this, however, suggesting that—as 130,000 years of seafaring history seems to indicate—humans simply are not a landlocked species. </p>
<p>“Even today,” Gillis claims, “we barely acknowledge the 95 percent of human history that took place before the rise of agricultural civilization.” That is, 95 percent of human history spent migrating both over land and over water, including the use of early but sophisticated means of marine transportation that proved resistant to archaeological preservation. For every lost village or forgotten house, rediscovered beneath a quiet meadow, there are a thousand ancient shipwrecks we don’t even know we should be looking for. </p>
<p>Perhaps speaking only for myself, this is where things get particularly interesting. Gillis points out that humanity’s deep maritime history has been almost entirely written out of our myths and religions. </p>
<p>In his words, “the book of Genesis would have us believe that our beginnings were wholly landlocked, but it was written at the time that the Hebrews were settling down to an agrarian existence.” That is, the myth of Genesis was written from the point of view of a culture already turning away from the sea, mastering animal domestication, mining, and wheeled transport, and settling down away from the coastline. It was learning to cultivate gardens: “The story of Eden served admirably as the foundational myth for agricultural society,” Gillis writes, but it performs very poorly when seen in the context of humanity’s seagoing past. </p>
<p>Briefly, I have to wonder what might have happened had works of literature—or, more realistically, highly developed oral traditions—from this earlier era been better preserved. Seen this way, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Odyssey-Fitzgerald-Translation-Homer/dp/B0053U7JTM//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=54cfa0ae9457ccb638b1e38a5e728f68"><em>The Odyssey</em></a> would merely be one, comparatively recent example of seafaring mythology, and from only one maritime culture. But what strange, aquatic world of gods and monsters might we still be in thrall of today had these pre-Edenic myths been preserved—as if, before the Bible, there had been some sprawling Lovecraftian world of coral reefs, lost ships, and distant archipelagoes, from the Mediterranean to Southeast Asia? </p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/turner2.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: “<a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-storm-at-sea-d25373">Storm at Sea</a>” (ca. 1824), by Joseph Mallord William Turner; courtesy <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-storm-at-sea-d25373">Tate Britain</a>].</small></p>
<p>This is where this post’s title comes from. “In short,” Gillis concludes, “we require a new narrative, one with, as Steve Mentz suggests, ‘<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bottom-Shakespeares-Ocean-Shakespeare-Now/dp/1847064930//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=06e122e5a426de29a56dd084817d3d22">fewer gardens, and more shipwrecks</a>.’”</p>
<p><em>Fewer gardens, more shipwrecks.</em> We are more likely, Gillis and Mentz imply, to be the outcast descendants of sunken ships and abandoned expeditions than we are the landed heirs of well-tended garden plots. </p>
<p>Seen this way, even if only for the purpose of a thought experiment, human history becomes a story of the storm, the wreck, the crash—the distant island, the unseen reef, the undertow—not the farm or even the garden, which would come to resemble merely a temporary domestic twist in this much more ancient human engagement with the sea.</p>

		<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/valley.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: River valley outside Kamdesh, Afghanistan, where the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kamdesh">Battle of Kamdesh</a>” occurred, an assault that loosely serves as the basis for part of John Renehan’s novel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Valley-Novel-John-Renehan/dp/0451471865//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=abee13cb7e7a89aeaa879df01152352c"><em>The Valley</em></a>].</small></p>
<p>While we’re on <a href="http://bldgblog.com/2016/12/in-case-you-missed-them/">the subject of books</a>, an interesting novel I read earlier this year is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Valley-Novel-John-Renehan/dp/0451471865//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=abee13cb7e7a89aeaa879df01152352c"><em>The Valley</em></a> by John Renehan. It’s a kind of police procedural set on a remote U.S. military base in the mountains of Afghanistan, fusing elements of investigative noir, a missing-person mystery, and, to a certain extent, a post-9/11 geopolitical thriller, all in one. </p>
<p>Architecturally speaking, the book’s includes a noteworthy scene quite late in the book—please look away now if you’d like to avoid a minor spoiler—in which the main character attempts to learn why a particularly isolated valley on the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan seems so unusually congested with insurgent fighters and other emergent sources of local conflict. </p>
<p>He thus hikes his way up through heavily guarded opium fields to what feels like the edge of the known world, as the valley he’s tracking steadily narrows ever upward until “there were no more river sounds. He’d gotten above the springs and runoff that fed it.” In the context of the novel, this scene feels as if the man has stepped off-stage, ascending to a world of solitude, clouds, and mountain silence. </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3322114115_7722503324_b.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Photo courtesy <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/soldiersmediacenter/3322114115">U.S. Army</a>, taken by Staff Sergeant Adam Mancini].</small> </p>
<p>What he sees there, however, is that the entire valley, in effect, has been quarantined. A baffling and massive concrete wall has been constructed by the U.S. military across the entire pass, severing the connection between two neighboring countries and forming an absolute barrier to insurgent troop movements. The wall has also decimated—or, at least, substantially harmed—the local economy. </p>
<p>Attempts to blow it up have left visible scars on its flanks, resulting in a blackened super-wall that is so far away from regional villages that many people don’t even know it’s there; they only know its side-effects.</p>
<p>“It was an impressive construction,” Renehan <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Valley-Novel-John-Renehan/dp/0451471865//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=abee13cb7e7a89aeaa879df01152352c">writes</a>. “There was no way they got vehicles all the way up here. It must have been heavy-lift helicopters laying in all the pieces and equipment.” </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1136955709_b5f1334d9e_b.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: U.S. military helicopter in Afghanistan, courtesy <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/soldiersmediacenter/1136955709/">U.S. Army</a>, taken by by Staff Sgt. Marcus J. Quarterman].</small></p>
<p>It was a titanic undertaking, “a wall of walls,” in his words, an improvised barrier like something out of <em>Mad Max</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Concrete blast barriers lined up twenty feet high, one against another on the slanting ground, shingled all across the gap, with another layer of shorter walls piled haphazardly atop, and more shoring up the gaps at the bottom. There must have been another complete set of walls built behind the one he could see, because the whole hulking thing had been filled with cement. It had oozed and dried like frosting at the seams, puddling through the gaps at the bottom.</p></blockquote>
<p>The man puts his hand on the concrete, knowing now that the whole valley had simply been sealed off. It “was closed.”</p>
<p>There are many things that interest me here. One is this notion that a distant megastructure, something of which few people are aware, nonetheless exhibits direct and tangible effects in their everyday lives; you might not even know such a structure exists, in other words, but your life has been profoundly shaped by it. </p>
<p>The metaphoric possibilities here are obvious. </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/6558827463_8217c72dc6_b.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Photo courtesy <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/soldiersmediacenter/6558827463">U.S. Army</a>, taken by Spc. Ken Scar, 7th MPAD].</small></p>
<p>But I was also reminded of another famous military wall constructed in a remote mountain landscape to keep a daunting adversary at bay, the so-called “<a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2009/12/alexanders-gates/">Alexander’s Gates</a>,” a monumental—and entirely mythic—architectural project allegedly built by Alexander the Great in the Caucasus region to keep monsters out of Europe. This myth was the <a href="http://www.pacificrimmovie.com/"><em>Pacific Rim</em></a> of its day, we might say.</p>
<p>I first encountered the story of Alexander’s Gates in Stephen T. Asma’s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monsters-Unnatural-History-Worst-Fears/dp/0199798095//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=1fcffc8ce5a4e6331dfdd33c79eb9e0f"><em>On Monsters</em></a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Alexander supposedly chased his foreign enemies through a mountain pass in the Caucasus region and then enclosed them behind unbreachable iron gates. The details and the symbolic significance of the story changed slightly in every medieval retelling, and it was retold often, especially in the age of exploration. (&#8230;) The maps of the time, the <em>mappaemundi</em>, almost always include the gates, though their placement is not consistent. Most maps and narratives of the later medieval period agree that this prison territory, created proximately by Alexander but ultimately by God, houses the savage tribes of Gog and Magog, who are referred to with great ambiguity throughout the Bible, and sometimes as individual monsters, sometimes as nations, sometimes as places.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other side of Alexander’s Gates was what Asma memorably calls a “monster zone.” </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4031630657_a8af963b99_b.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>[Image: Photo courtesy <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/soldiersmediacenter/4031630657">U.S. Army</a>, taken by U.S. Army Pfc. Andrya Hill, 4th Brigade Combat Team].</small></p>
<p>In any case, you can learn a bit more about the gates <a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2009/12/alexanders-gates/">in this earlier post on BLDGBLOG</a>, but it instantly came to mind while reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Valley-Novel-John-Renehan/dp/0451471865//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=abee13cb7e7a89aeaa879df01152352c"><em>The Valley</em></a>. </p>
<p>Renehan’s bulging “wall of walls,” constructed by U.S. military helicopters in a hostile landscape so remote it is all but over the edge of the world, purely with the goal of sealing off an entire mountain valley, is a kind of 21st-century update to Alexander’s Gates. </p>
<p>In fact, it makes me wonder what sorts of megastructures exist in contemporary global military mythology—what urban legends soldiers tell themselves and each other about their own forces or those of their adversaries—from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/14/middleeast/iran-missile-facilities/">underground super-bunkers</a> to unbreachable desert walls. What are the Alexander’s Gates of today?</p>

		<p>There are a few books I wanted to mention here at the height of the holiday season, not because they’re new or even necessarily recent but because, selfishly, I simply wish more people had read them. If you’re looking for an extra gift, or just a last-minute surprise, for anyone with an interest in architecture, landscape, archaeology, acoustics, geopolitics, history, and more, here are eight titles to consider. </p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/firstbooks.jpg?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strait-Gate-Thresholds-Western-History/dp/0300211082//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=5094de4e8d860cef49232ce2e0aa2341"><em>The Strait Gate: Thresholds and Power in Western History</em></a> by Daniel Jütte (Yale University Press)—This is an academic work, in both tone and approach, but of the ideal kind: nearly every page had something I wanted to underline, write down, or scramble to look up elsewhere. Put simply, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strait-Gate-Thresholds-Western-History/dp/0300211082//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=5094de4e8d860cef49232ce2e0aa2341"><em>The Strait Gate</em></a> is a history of the door, but, as Jütte shows, this ultra-quotidian architectural detail—the dividing line between inside and outside—has political, psychological, Constitutional, philosophical, mythological, narrative, cultural, and even material implications that are easy to overlook. Whether it’s a controversial order that “all door handles and knobs be removed from homes and shops” so that the metal could be melted down for war materiel, divine gateways as described in the <em>Book of Revelation</em>, or the resonant phenomenon of <em>Torschlusspanik</em>—“panic of gate closure,” aka a fear of being locked out—Jütte’s book is a superb example of how we can still look at architecture afresh. </p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Fossil-Hunters-Dinosaurs-Mammoths/dp/0691150133//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=d119ea115f70d659e11b6bc06ba02f32"><em>The First Fossil Hunters: Dinosaurs, Mammoths, and Myth in Greek and Roman Times</em></a> by Adrienne Mayor (Princeton University Press)—What did cultures without the benefit of modern scientific knowledge think of the monstrous skeletons and fossilized bones they occasionally unearthed? Quite a lot, as it happens. It turns out that huge chunks of human mythology, including the existence of dragons and the idea of an extinct race of titanic super-human ancestors, can all be traced back to misinterpretations of paleontology. Mayor’s writing is casually engaging—even quite funny, at times—and the book’s many examples of ancient human societies encountering monstrous, inexplicable, and possibly otherworldly things hidden in the earth stuck with me long after reading it. </p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sound-Book-Science-Sonic-Wonders/dp/0393350584//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=467e82812c3f6cf6b0c05e22b5ed329d"><em>The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World</em></a> by Trevor Cox (W.W. Norton)—If you have even a passing interest in sound, this is the book to read. Trevor Cox, an acoustic engineer, introduces readers to sonic phenomena around the world, both naturally occurring and artificially induced, from the frozen surface of Russia’s Lake Baikal to Stone Age tombs in rural England. There are examples of sound art, acoustic science, and even landscape-scale auditory effects that easily justify the subtitle, “sonic wonders of the world.”  This would pair well with David Toop’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ocean-Sound-David-Toop/dp/1852427434//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=79cdb6ef6675dddf2a2d54bad9785355"><em>Ocean of Sound</em></a>, for those of you interested not just in acoustics but in avant-garde composition and ambient music, as well. </p>

<p><strong>(4)</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tomb-Agamemnon-Wonders-World/dp/0674063880//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=b389acd71d6f7a3c121f90a1b87e6833"><em>The Tomb of Agamemnon</em></a> by Cathy Gere (Harvard University Press)—This slim book, part of classicist <a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2007/09/the-wonders-of-the-world-an-interview-with-mary-beard-pt-1/">Mary</a> <a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2007/09/the-elephants-of-rome-an-interview-with-mary-beard-pt-2/">Beard</a>’s excellent (but, sadly, now hibernating) “<a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/collection.php?cpk=1218">Wonders of the World</a>” series for Harvard University Press, hit so many sweet spots for me. Author Cathy Gere convincingly shows how Mediterranean archaeological discoveries over the course of the 19th century helped to shape an emerging European mythos of the glories of war and historical empire. These same emphases lent themselves extremely well, however, to tragic and grotesque distortions that soon fed into the twin ideologies of Nazism and 20th-century fascism. Along the way, Gere writes, Classical discoveries misinterpreted by modern biases helped to justify British involvement in World War I. Gere’s book includes a brief, beautiful, and monumentally sad description of young, Homer-quoting scholars being shipped off to war to fight a rising evil from the East—only to be annihilated in the sodden trenches of the Somme. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tomb-Agamemnon-Wonders-World/dp/0674063880//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=b389acd71d6f7a3c121f90a1b87e6833"><em>The Tomb of Agamemnon</em></a> is probably one of my favorite ten books of the past decade; no other book I’ve read in that time conveys the true political stakes of archaeological research and the clear and obvious risks in distorting history for ideological ends.</p>
<p><strong>(5)</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lawrence-Arabia-Deceit-Imperial-Making/dp/0307476413//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=220f798e35abbff377a301fa471c941f"><em>Lawrence in Arabia: War, Deceit, Imperial Folly and the Making of the Modern Middle East</em></a> by Scott Anderson (Anchor)—It’s a little disingenuous to suggest that this widely publicized book has been overlooked, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lawrence-Arabia-Deceit-Imperial-Making/dp/0307476413//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=220f798e35abbff377a301fa471c941f"><em>Lawrence in Arabia</em></a> is nonetheless an uncannily well-timed history of the post-World War I Middle East and well worth taking the time to read. I was utterly absorbed by it for nearly a week. Part military adventure, part geopolitical biography of Lawrence of Arabia, part soul-crushing alternative history of a region that could have been—complete with agonizing descriptions of the infamous assault on Gallipoli—this book will make you see the entire 20th century differently, up to and including our own century’s Iraq War and the rise of ISIS. </p>
<p><strong>(6)</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Map-Nation-Biography-Ordnance-Survey/dp/1847082548//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=270716c4501e68dce22189ef6dba36f2"><em>Map of a Nation: A Biography of the Ordnance Survey</em></a> by Rachel Hewitt (Granta)—I mentioned this book in a <a href="http://bldgblog.com/2016/12/covert-cartographics/">recent post</a> and I would recommend it again. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Map-Nation-Biography-Ordnance-Survey/dp/1847082548//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=270716c4501e68dce22189ef6dba36f2"><em>Map of a Nation</em></a> tells the story of the British Ordnance Survey, the institute’s original geopolitical context, and the experimental cartographic tools it used to make its imperial surveys more accurate. For anyone interested in geography, maps, landscape, or British history, Hewitt’s book is a must-read.  </p>

On one level, it’s a story of bored teenagers using synthesized sound and DIY home electronics to hack the global telephone network; on another, it’s a story with hugely metaphoric, almost occult undertones. The phone system’s diffuse and labyrinthine system of “inward operators,” robotic mechanical test numbers, and secret military phone exchanges—to name only a few ingredients—takes on the air of something invented by Alan Moore or Grant Morrison: teens encountering a world of numerological connection and mechanical intelligence through handheld receivers in the long afternoons of the 1960s and 70s. So good. </p>
<p><strong>(8)</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sealab-Americas-Forgotten-Quest-Ocean/dp/0743247450//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=a326065787fd9d7547395f0ccfab438e"><em>Sealab: America’s Forgotten Quest to Live and Work on the Ocean Floor</em></a> by Ben Hellwarth (Simon &#038; Schuster)—The only thing that makes me pause before recommending Ben Hellwarth’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sealab-Americas-Forgotten-Quest-Ocean/dp/0743247450//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=a326065787fd9d7547395f0ccfab438e"><em>Sealab</em></a> right now is that a brand new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sealab-Americas-Forgotten-Quest-Ocean/dp/1439189846//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=14ee23f5f5eba4810f261904511f08f9">paperback edition</a> is due out in June 2017; but, that aside, I heartily endorse this one. Imagine Archigram teaming up with a secretive branch of the U.S. military to invent an utterly bonkers new version of human civilization on the ocean floor, and you’ve roughly pictured what this book is about. Whether it’s describing what were, in effect, moon bases at the bottom of the sea or bizarre experiments with farm animals, submerged ecological research stations or Cold War espionage in the Sea of Okhotsk, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sealab-Americas-Forgotten-Quest-Ocean/dp/0743247450//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=a326065787fd9d7547395f0ccfab438e"><em>Sealab</em></a> is as much outsider architectural history as it is a maritime geopolitical thriller. At the very least, preorder the forthcoming paperback if you want to wait before diving in.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s super-obnoxious to end with my own book, but if you’re looking for something to read this winter—or if you need a gift for someone who can be hard to shop for—consider picking up a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Burglars-Guide-City-Geoff-Manaugh/dp/0374117268//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=d49ec9a99b59608ed7baabeb8e8d09db"><em>A Burglar’s Guide to the City</em></a>. It’s a mix of true crime, architectural theory, and first-person reporting, from a Chicago lock-picking club to flying with the LAPD’s Air Support Division, from an architect who became the most prolific bank robber of the 19th century to fake apartments run by the British police. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Burglars-Guide-City-Geoff-Manaugh/dp/0374117268//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=bldgblog-20&#038;linkId=d49ec9a99b59608ed7baabeb8e8d09db"><em>A Burglar’s Guide</em></a> includes interviews with a Toronto burglar known for using the city’s fire code to help pick his next target, with renowned architect Bernard Tschumi, with game designers, and with FBI Special Agents, among others, and the whole thing is currently being <a href="http://deadline.com/2016/10/a-burglars-guide-to-the-city-modern-day-robin-hoods-drama-cbs-scorpion-team-alex-kurtzman-justin-lin-1201830670/">adapted for TV</a> by CBS Studios. <a href="http://burglarsguide.com/">Check it out</a>, if you get the chance and let me know what you think. </p>
