Thanks for remembering that old post.

I love your description of &lt;em&gt;Tales From The Loop&lt;/em&gt;, in your first comment, as looking “like a Scandinavian version of rural Ohio, because itself adapted from Stålenhag’s americanization of rural Sweden.” I’m often reminded—despite the man’s obvious political shortcomings—of Heidegger’s comment that “Americanism,” with all its gigantism and speed, was just a “concentrated rebound” of modern Europe, a kind of distorting mirror, or perhaps a shadow lengthened at sunset.]]></description>

found it! 

http://www.bldgblog.com/2007/12/the-future-warehouse-of-unwanted-books/

the passage I was trying to remember was this:

&quot;In other words, a relatively random piece of 100-year old legislation – dealing with copyright law, of all things – has begun to exhibit architectural effects.

These architectural effects include the production of huge warehouses in the damp commuter belts of outer London. These aren’t libraries, of course; they’re stockpiles. Text bunkers.&quot;

2007... wow.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is genuinely one of the most insightful pieces I&#039;ve read on the roots of human imagination (and on the entertainment industry in particular). 

It also loops back and ties into an old post of yours about the gigantic warehouses of unwanted books in rural Britain, where you wrote (I quote from memory, which means I&#039;m almost certainly paraphrasing) that that was an instance were &quot;laws create architecture&quot;--

I think what you&#039;re talking about in both pieces is the same pattern: the effects of one specific bureaucracy on architecture and environment in one, and, in the other (meta) level, its effects on our ability to imagine both environment and architecture.

In this sense it&#039;s also interesting to look at the recent Tales from the Loop, a (mostly static) nostalgic ride around mid-70s Americana, which looks like a Scandinavian version of rural Ohio, because itself adapted from Stålenhag&#039;s americanization of rural Sweden. How many layers are there? And how much of it is based on what American movies Stålenhag grew up with?]]></description>

Federico, thanks for this—sorry for the late reply. The idea of a permanent abandoned film set being absorbed into everyday life—let alone one depicting occupied France—has interesting ideological implications all over it. 

Hope you’re staying safe and sane in lockdown!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ll have seen it by now, but:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/paris-lockdown-leaves-streets-stuck-1942-abandoned-film-set

&quot;Residents confined to their homes in a corner of northern Paris have been plunged back to one of the darkest moments of the city’s past.

Two streets – Rue Berthe and Rue Androuet – in Montmartre in the shadow of the Sacré-Coeur basilica have been left in a timewarp of the Nazi occupation after they were returned to 1942 for a film set.&quot;

That&#039;s the next level of simulation: a period film set during a real pandemic. if it&#039;s a monitoring device, right about now it&#039;s monitoring silence.

But it&#039;s also interesting for future archaeologists: if all humans disappeared now, what would they make of that corner of the city? A monument? A strange Western version of a cargo cult? A 1:1 scale reconstruction, perhaps abandoned when it was just getting started?]]></description>

Moor means dark person or Black coming from the word moros and black originally meant pale and only a 500 year old word.Blacks were called moors in fact all melaninated people were called moors in all languages muur Dutch called us Moro the Philippine called us it goes on and on throughout the world.Also the word Mu’ur or Mo’or comes from Mu or Mo in short for LeMuria and the indigenous people there would be called lemurians or simply Mu’urs vowels are interchangeable do the research even the word Nuwaupian translates to Muur]]></description>
