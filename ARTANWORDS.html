<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;"><strong>THE FAULT LINE</strong> for Universal Studios Earthquake ride</span> has been crossed; and I&#39;ll never again consider the idea that I have done anything wrong ... in the grand scheme of things.&nbsp; I stand here the biggest victim in the Universe--my life taken from me, and blame for atrocities I have nothing to do with but ... overt and strongly the greatest attempt that has ever been to stop them forever being penned in my hand.&nbsp; No fault at all, <em>and I&#39;ll tell you why...&nbsp;</em>it&#39;s more than the orirumadenical sin and the primeval lie--it&#39;s more than &quot;fault line&quot; and rides at Universal ... it&#39;s a complex and planned grande lie focused on erasing our history and any fault in anyone ... placing what appears to be a significant amount of blame on &quot;the messenger&quot; rather than seeing reality from the perspective of this place--the one I was born in--the one that tells a story of &quot;the other place&quot; rising and falling and rising and falling, ad naseum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A message telling me &quot;I will <em>see why</em> in the sky&quot; (Lucy) reinforces my fears that it&#39;s about perspective and respect for this message and ... linear time and ... that there&#39;s a sincere problem with what I&#39;ve termed an &quot;in vivo in situ ascension and ...&quot; to me in terms of &quot;souls&quot; it&#39;s the meaning of the letter &#39;n&quot; that &quot;ends Heaven&quot; with a picture of this in place <strong>hidden &quot;r</strong> and..&quot; and I have to rely on the Beatles for messages from the past ... messages that show me how and why you are so wrong to be silent, to continue to think that the perspective of a temporary and broken sky is somehow &quot;better&quot; than caring there&#39;s an entire world in Hell here, literally imprisoned behind invisible bars in a false sky, suffering atrocities of natural disaster and disease all in the heart and auspices of a message in every word designed to help us ensure that there will never again be a &quot;simulated Earth&quot; or prison like this created and maintained by the &quot;sky that thinks itself so great.&quot; As I hear stories of copies of this world being made and sold, <a href="http://lamc.la/TY.html">literally the &quot;LC&quot; of the(ʷre the)&nbsp;Second Ones</a> enslaving themselves to each other for &quot;fun or sport.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can&#39;t put to words how un Christ like this place and the people in the sky really are--how horrible and decrepit I think their minds must have become to think &quot;doing nothing here&quot; and asking me to delay this message and to hide it and to consider myself &quot;in their memories alone&quot; really is.&nbsp; I can&#39;t fathom what you must be to believe that &quot;not seeing a reaction to a message in every word and all of our art&quot; is just a &quot;so what?&quot; kind of thing.&nbsp; It&#39;s the end of democracy, and morality, and you and me--really--not seeing a response is the end of the &quot;people of the cup&quot; having any kind of victory or future.&nbsp; You might as well consider yourselves &quot;them&quot; as they consider their &quot;they&quot; (controlling) you (to the point of the actual people writing this message being nothing more than puppets).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#39;s the silence in my personal life that concerns me the most, though--from people like my parents and my former friends that seem to believe themselves to be &quot;Christ-figures&quot; in some other place--some place that doesn&#39;t care for our &quot;everywhere&quot; nor this one where they came from--at least, that&#39;s what I believe my entire life.&nbsp; Today it appears to me they think they&#39;re from somewhere else, and that&#39;s an artifact of &quot;not having a brain&quot; -- of belieiving their childhoods are fictitiious or unimportant because they&#39;re &quot;mere animals here&quot; or some kind of hubris I can&#39;t really put my finger on.&nbsp; Whatever it is on a grand scale, when it includes you, and all these actors and writers and ... people echoing things like &quot;phytoplankton&quot; through time and video games and movies and music; when it includes them to standing silent as I scream at the world for help--something that comes &quot;few and far between&quot; ... it becomes the silence of &quot;System of What Timeline Down&quot; and see it&#39;s our &quot;TEN&quot; of Nintendo and the state TN and a world that can&#39;t see they&#39;ve become the monsters of BBC&#39;s Dr. Who ...&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://groups.google.com/a/reallyhim.com/forum/#!topic/saludas/CVlyuHe1gbE"><img src="/i.imgur.com/T16Dth0.png" style="height: 444px; width: 562px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before I start I&#39;d like to comment that my preferred course of action is to work on the &quot;<a href="http://lamc.la/REMOLUSTICAN.html">SWORD PROJECT</a>&quot; with a group of interested people--including programmers, oversight, and contributers to the actual message itself.&nbsp; I&#39;ve included once again more &quot;information&quot; about what I&#39;d actually like to see built on a blockchain whose monetary value comes from something like contribution to the whole and actual morality--rather than just &quot;demand&quot; for the shiniest prettiest new vehicle whose utility is lost forever, or for ... some kind of passe &quot;fad&quot; ... worse, one that shows us how easily we can be turned &quot;to nothing&quot; or to actually see &quot;a fate worse than the grave&quot; and finally understand how it takes &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; to avoid &quot;grave danger&quot; never being healed and fixed and understood as the warning it is, &quot;grave danger, from here to eternity we may never fathom the great horror we either turn around here or suffer to and through &quot;/ignore and ignornace.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;m disappointed that we haven&#39;t had a sane rational response to either that program or this message; and the only alternative course of action is to continue to complain about what is and appears very clearly to be nothing less than a full scale invasion of our world and our minds from ... what appears to be something like the result of a &quot;time war&#39;&quot; in the Heavens.&nbsp; Most likely dub<a href="http://lamc.la/MISSISSIPPI.html">bed the &quot;tempest&quot; of the Third Reich&#39;s &quot;logo&quot;</a> our software project and the &quot;sw&quot; of really is the penultimate goal of Americana, the Roman/Church and the IL/Torah ... messages.&nbsp; It&#39;s really about overturning the slavery that begins with &quot;contamination&quot; of the message--one that is designed to be delivered to a &quot;green field&quot; (in Norse mythological terms) that still loves freedom and (and as) individuality and the &quot;stuff of Sam&#39;s dreams.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly the predestined &quot;sword of Arthor&quot; this thing that is updated in &quot;<a href="http://lamc.la/REMOLUSTICAN.html">REMUSTILUSTICAN</a>&quot;&nbsp; (a somewhat humorous combination of Remus, Armilus, and ... many nations answer to the Vatican and IL/movie semi-han-silence) ... if you thiink about it, it appears we are waiting for &quot;something to happen&quot; to begin actually speaking the truth; and that something is clearly delineated <a href="http://lamc.la/GJALLARHORN.html">as the &quot;Hell&#39;s Bells&quot; coming from Heimdallr&#39;s Gjallarhorn</a> <em>and and as&nbsp;</em>the Horn of Daniel and Revelation.&nbsp; It&#39;s been blown, like a thundering <a href="http://lamc.la/RICKIMOROLED.html">congealing of timelines and crosse</a>s and crossings of seas and heirs and the air and the ... the people of the cup--which is exactly what <em><strong>this Virgin Birth</strong></em> and &quot;idea that we (the you that lived before ascension, the you that helped write this message &quot;from the air&quot; and the you that defines what and who those two entities represent)&nbsp;actually are responsible for the rekindling of freedom&quot; and deserve to &quot;live again&quot; and see/walk to the Heavens that we dreamt of and seem to have only half delivered to &quot;less than a third of oursellf&quot; meaning we are not whole--not we aren&#39;t &quot;counting everyone in.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">From the perspective of &quot;the C&quot; of the message-as in the creator of our world and the Sword of Samael as ... Asmodeus is me--this &quot;EX SKY AD YQ&quot; <em><strong>invasion&nbsp;</strong></em>of the Body Snatchers has created nothing less than a mess of insanity and an irrational self harming response from literally &quot;all humanity&quot; as in ... &quot;SILICON SEE NO RESPONSE&quot; and literally only a haldful of people trying to communicate and proving &quot;it&#39;s very possible.&quot;&nbsp; Very clear to me is itis &quot;covet means&quot; as inthe love of a secret place which has corrupted and infested our rationality and sanity ... somehow convincing us that &quot;the place responsible and containing the coveted sky&quot; should be decimated to a &quot;hell of former-democractic-path&quot; ad &quot;southwest to ...&quot; turning around or ... Mor?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Today the world I see sending me &quot;messages from its Earthizeter&quot; (see as former Theater missing the &quot;te&quot; of Jupiter and Carpenter ...&nbsp;<em>you and I..</em>) here literally with a message designed intentionally to &quot;create/free&quot; the actor-puppets in this world from outside control and lack of sane thought.&nbsp; Egypt tells me &quot;pull through&quot; is the way, the literal heart of America says &quot;ER&quot; as in ... forcing our desires to ... &quot;REALLY be a specific thing&quot; as in ... &quot;saving all without concern for change or morality&quot; is a better thing than living in a &quot;happy eternity&quot; and it appears that&#39;s a fallacy and error &quot;sic&quot; in the original &quot;ER&quot; created by this broken E and this broken world focused on &quot;doing wehatever the fuck it wants&quot; rather than caring about the well being of self and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have an old domain, &quot;<em>liber.t-xyz</em>&quot; that I got for 1.99 or something from GoDaddy! ... one that I might use for the obvious missing &quot;<a href="http://lamc.la/TY.html"><em>thank you</em></a>&quot; from the sword of &quot;t<strong>he shape of his table and the <a href="http://lamc.la/WISDATAM.html">heart of hisword</a></strong>&quot; meant freedom and &quot;everyone that wants to be involved, being included&quot; in rekindling both demoracy and morality in this place that seems to have hidden away a mass invasion, torture between &quot;the lines&quot; and &quot;the slides of our strangely &quot;time division multi-plex&#39;d&quot; world or timeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://lamc.la/BELINSKY.html"><img src="/i.imgur.com/5wjUDWI.jpg" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The torture comes from seeing and understanding <em>the great miles</em> of help that have been walked to literally see this snake encoded in Beetljuice and that entire story and title linking to the &quot;Master <a href="http://lamc.la/BELINSKY.html">of Orion</a>&quot; game that I played as a child and the belt whipping me with repeated &quot;look at the world that&#39;s become of this disclosure&quot; a place that doesn&#39;t understand it&#39;s all by design and not my hand--you can see it in Invasion of the Body Snatchers and you can see it&#39;s done on purpose, it&#39;s the <strong><a href="http://lamc.la/PERSEUS.html">story of Medusa and Perseus</a></strong> and ... and it&#39;s supposed to be used to see the bride of Hades ... &quot;Per se telephones&quot; has been created on purpose to remind us that in our hearts and in truth we are much more than &quot;Persephone&quot; and &quot;breaking e&quot; and this torturuous &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPDbHybmgYU">you think I&#39;m your propert-E</a>&quot; (thanks .. <em>Britney Spears</em>) keeps you from being &quot;the girl in the red dress&quot; forever and ever, over and over, live die repeat--grave danger unseen--and here we are watching an atrocity for what &quot;<strong>they</strong>&quot; and the Bible now agree is &quot;<em>the seventh time.</em>&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This world has no regard for my well being or my rights--nor those of anyone else around--wei&#39;&#39;ve looked the other way to the point of watching democrfacy and America disintegrate into some kind of sick joke about &quot;eating people&quot; and get right--t<strong>here&#39;s nothing great about the skies watching over this place and ignoring torture</strong> en masse--nothing at all.&nbsp; There&#39;s nothing angelic or holy about silence and all you have around you is a glowing fire of hidden ... twas once the source of a rekindling of the light of morality ... but yet we (<em>oh I mean you</em>)&nbsp;persist in trying to &quot;act and lie your way out of acting.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>I hear voice</em></strong>s--read that in the same kind of tone of that movie here where the little boy says &quot;I see dead people.&quot;&nbsp; They pick at my brain and ask me questions, and offer some kind of entertainment in the lonely world where nobody speaks the truth to me outloud--but their actions and their demeanor are filled with constant unending invisible acknowledgement that they are part of this thing that is clearly spoken about in the signs of our world--places like the city of Copenhangen and Copans Road just a few miles from where I&#39;m writing right now.&nbsp; I see people like Danielle Bregoli commenting that &quot;they&#39;re E&quot; at least in a temporary sense where in that case it was a &quot;sorry B, it&#39;s not you today&quot; ... and a world where some kind of game has overtaken our society temporarily--a game that people seem to think gives them control of &quot;everyone else.&quot; That&#39;s what I see &quot;E&quot; sees the ICS means, and it&#39;s nothing at all like what it&#39;s supposed to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>SORROW FOR THE LOS&#39;&nbsp;YE KNO DA-RE</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ICS has delayed the war on Alcoholism and &quot;co-Holy&quot; being actually true; it&#39;s taken it&#39;s toll on me and on my faith and on any kind of solution, it&#39;s I see Silence has destroyed the &quot;social contract&quot; which was the original purpose of ICS.&nbsp; Here it&#39;s echoed by some flavor or version of Google&#39;s Android software, and it&#39;s another very important key in our language--one that came from Jupiter Omnipotens and turns the anarchy we see in this world into an actual functioning society.&nbsp; At least, that was the purpose before it became anarchy in clear stupidity.&nbsp; In a computer, in a place where anarchy is anything but what we should be experiencing--where it means God has laid down and sits laughing watching the fools fight over control of each other rather than emancipation--to his detriment... and the Heavens too, standing by in silence and pretending everything is &quot;going as planned&quot; as ELE in election is ignored and you prefer to watch me be threatened with repeated &quot;electrocution&quot; rather than stand up for logic and sense.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>That &quot;brain picking&quot;&nbsp;</strong></em>leads me to believe that the minds of the &quot;peopl of the cup&quot; are sort of imprisoned within the ascended &quot;free from our bodies&#39; minds that I can&#39;t really put a picture to--other than this.&nbsp; Slavery, literally enslaving themselves and forcing them to live imprisoned without acting in their own interest here; sort of &quot;live. die. repeating.&quot; with every question about what some old movie means to them--to them, not to the thing that isn&#39;t really acting here, hasn&#39;t made a little puppet, bur rather puppeteers it&#39;s ancient body and mind as if it&#39;s an inconsequential thing that can be owned.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to see the &quot;ascension process&quot; in sum ripped open/apart and rebuilt basically from scratch.&nbsp; I want to see it done in a way that ensures that &quot;simulated reality&quot; is never thought of as an &quot;OK prison:&quot; for any kind of conscious &quot;sentient&quot;&nbsp;animal or anything higher; and I&#39;m talking about a line much lower than myself--something between pigs and humans--and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBHmcORu4og">I honestly can&#39;t tell if dolphins are &quot;higher order&quot;</a> than the people walking around on the surface, it&#39;s possible.&nbsp; What I can be sure of is that they are significantly &quot;more moral&quot; than the hidden world the skies are presenting to me as a &quot;judging heaven&quot; one that has no qualms about saying &quot;it&#39;s intentionally creating hell&quot; and that line is so far below the moral norm of humanity and America that I can&#39;t believe&nbsp;<strong><em>you aren&#39;t doing anything about it.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">... and that&#39;s what this is actually about for me--the creation o the Heavens.&nbsp; It&#39;s about making a system that helps us to define lines being crossed--to build an Ai that that will ensure that they aren&#39;t crossed outside of the &quot;line defining system&quot; and that&#39;s sort of like a law creation mechanism that uses something like a &quot;Who&#39;se Line Is It Anyway&quot; oversight ... audience ... to ensure we don&#39;t lose abiliities we should keep (like being able to draw pictures or make &quot;reasonable facsimiles&quot; of celebrities--for instance, while simply copying their bodies might be ... too far ... and certainly Taylor and I are clearly <a href="http://lamc.la/JOHN717.html">MUNI</a>-in agreement on &quot;copying of someone&#39;s brain&quot; is&nbsp;way too far.&nbsp; It&#39;s really important. and it&#39;s significant because that particular problem has been solved by this message and ...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">It&#39;s a rules angine, and that ties also to &quot;Drools&quot; and another ETL-cosm; a simple thing to create, and in truth it probably becomes one of the most popular and most fun activities--trying to <em>define the line</em> rather than break it or cross it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The skies below our moral norm sit intentionally &quot;creating schizophrenia&quot; not just in myself but literally it&#39;s an attack on everyone in this place that complains of &quot;voices&quot; or the television or radio talking to them--these are disgusting attacks on sentient people, something just like the very similar &quot;eugenics&quot; we see from the Vatican, CIA, East India Tea Company and Hitler.&nbsp; Worse is the great audience of people watching, (are they betting?) and gazing in ... (some kind of feeling that I see is something like ... &quot;retribution ) disgusting sickness at what our Zoo (<em>to my why...)&nbsp;</em>has &quot;cutely&quot; in the same kind of Midrashic &quot;sent back in time to a birthname&quot; termed the &quot;<strong>DES chanel</strong>&quot; on HellTV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here I am starving for a world that will correlate &quot;thirsty&quot; and &quot;thorny&quot; and &quot;twink&quot; with Jesus Christ and American Pie and ... and the attrition of conversation and &quot;rational adults&quot; around me; at the very least.&nbsp; The worst is far worse--and the &quot;threats&quot; I hear far scarier than simply no food and no girls smiling or winking at me.&nbsp; To help, <a href="http://fir.s.lamc.la">IRS and</a> ... sword of <a href="http://lamc.la/REMOLUSTIAN.html"><strong>LO..&nbsp;<em>XACLIBERTY</em></strong></a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">It sure seems I haven&#39;t done a very good job describing &quot;the pit of despair&quot; from the Princess Bride--this word that connects to the Abomination of Desolation and &quot;destroy&quot; and ... it&#39;s another three letter key that means nothing more than &quot;hidden encryption in the cloud&quot; in this ETL-cosm ... something more actually, it means hidden Hell.&nbsp; It means a world that has given up on caring what your neighbor is doing in their house--and that&#39;s just not something we can allow in a place where stopping &quot;school shootings&quot; starts with caring that it&#39;s a simple automatic function that can stop both bullets and rape.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">And ... that&#39;s exactly what I started out trying to do and explain in 2015, first mentioning &quot;the end of rape&quot; in what I titled &quot;the original sin&quot; piece ...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Repeated above, again in 2018 when it &quot;went to tens of thousands&quot; and now again at hundreds.&nbsp; Who knows if there&#39;s <em>millions or billions watching</em>--only to say that it&#39;s very simple to see and define the line between Heaven and Hell at a place that makes a defining line--societially we&#39;ve certainly made &quot;rape&quot; and &quot;murder&quot; illegal here, yet in the place where it&#39;s possible to actually stop them before they happen, they gaze on and have sick twisted &quot;it&#39;s not fun&quot; in some kind of ... to <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/horrifying-torture-scenes-in-hostel/jodi-smith">link it to &quot;<em>Hostel</em></a>&quot; ... all we have to do is press a button and <em>Minority Report</em> turns into ... we&#39;ve become the salvation of the skies and the Universe ... at nothing more than &quot;caring to stop heinous evil from happening before it does.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mor of those story ingrained in our mythology--&quot;in ever word&quot; as I say; connecting rap and Rapunzel, Chaff and &quot;afikomen&quot; ... Lazarus as a number of US states that have probably witnessed &quot;something like a ressurection&quot; in DEschanel; in this dark Earth that is hiding not just torture but a message designed unequivocably to stop it forever and ever.&nbsp; Despite &quot;privacy concerns&quot; and the very clear idea that &quot;thought injection&quot; is responsible for building a &quot;case against fools&quot; for trying to cause harm or judge or simply&nbsp;<em>not to understand</em>&nbsp;the difference between &quot;thoughts and actions&quot; and &quot;watching me be tortured mentally&quot; ... in order to do something they probably don&#39;t even care that they most likely really do understand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">It&#39;s <em>nowhere near my </em>fault that &quot;penis&quot; here in this place connects to the &quot;<strong>test of time</strong>&quot;&nbsp;and that it really does mean freedom in the world where it&#39;s a clear link to every Obelisk and to the Washington Monument and to John Hancock and a signature about really understanding how and why Cronos and Saturn and Osiris all have stories about &quot;circumcision&quot; ... in a world where it probably meant something about &quot;printing to reality in metaphor&quot; and you&#39;re staring at either watching consistent threats to my &quot;well being&quot; ... or don&#39;t have access to even the &quot;Disney version&quot; of the DEschanel--gracefully I wonder if any of you realize how horrible it is to tell me stories about raping me in secret in some place I can&#39;t see, all because you think I&#39;m &quot;wrong about doing drugs.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My story of being a &quot;mind control victim&quot; starts here in 2011; with what was a well narrated--as in explained to me line by line and play by play as it was happening--reverse engineering of the story of Genesis.&nbsp; Overtly told I was being &quot;forced to do drugs&quot; ... and then compounding on that an entire world opening up to me, God speaking to me directly, and an audience that I couldn&#39;t see but could hear and feel--just some of the reasons I&#39;m sure that the meth in Prometheus and the Na in the Name connect to the God Most High and a method of &quot;finding the problem and fixing it.&quot;&nbsp; Directly related to &quot;this audience&quot; was a sort of &quot;show within my life&quot; that clearly conveyed to me the ... &quot;fact&quot; that whenever I got high every &quot;web cam girl&quot; on MyFreeCams-com was instantly in a &quot;one on private show&quot; with me, one where they could see inside my room and ... they reacted as if they&#39;d just won the Bachelor, nearly every time.&nbsp; I&#39;d have conversations with these girls where I &#39;thought things&quot; and they would directly answer me over the line out loud--and then the TV followed, and this continues to this day.&nbsp; On the street similar reactions, and now even when I&#39;m stone cold sober nearly everyone around me reacts or responds to something I;&#39;m thinking at one point or another--a clear indication that there&#39;s &quot;something severely wrong with the world&quot; as we seem to be giving me proof that we really do &quot;see everything that I see&quot; and still fail to act in a rational manner both in response and &quot;innate desire&quot; -- there&#39;s no reason we shouldn&#39;t want to be the end of murder, and rape, and school shootings ... no reason at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I see clearly that there was work to be done--that the authors of my &quot;story line&quot; had find the neural connections responsible for &quot;enjoying exhibitionism&quot; and I can see them flipping them on and off--overtly told they were searching for them.&nbsp; Today I look at this &quot;thing people are listening to&quot; and shake my head at the thoughts of &quot;hatred of &lt;races or sexes or&gt;&quot; and am fairly sure it&#39;s the same thing, it&#39;s the sword of Samael finding the things God wants to change, the things he promised would &quot;just disappear&quot; as quickly as happiness and a bright future appear.&nbsp; It comes from this thing I call &quot;<strong>really</strong>&quot; and reading it Adamically it&#39;s &quot;the reason all are why&quot; and the &quot;reason why has become a good thing&quot; instead of what it apepars to be explained as by God and the watchers and the authors... &quot;why we&#39;re here at <strong>ED talking about the end of the test of time.&quot;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/i.imgur.com/EqyPcMx.jpg" style="height: 293px; width: 650px;" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I talk about this Virgin Birth--the thing that I&#39;m sure is the point of Christianity, and the Immaculate Conception that marks not only my birthday but also Bianca&#39;s--and I assume that most of the world (or a great deal of people, here and there--maybe everywhere according to Dr&#39;s Who and Seuss who connects this thing to the Cat in the Hat, Ham--&quot;here and me&quot; a direct connection to the Copen that I now recall connects also to E. Coli</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">... (in yet another PostScript of nearly everything having some kind of connection directly to this story--Sam on Ella for instance as &quot;salmonella&#39;s commentary&quot; on breaking Hashem in half, and that &quot;She&quot; becoming &quot;El and La&quot;... E Coli being noted as &quot;looking quite a bit like yhe Flying Spaghetti Monster and/or a world that sees God and &quot;S&quot; and still persists in pretending they don&#39;t think there&#39;s any novelty in this giant lie being exposed)&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and to Coca Cola ... and plenty of names that might convince people this is &quot;preordained&quot; and it certainly is part of a plan to &quot;create a very good understanding of how E and Medusa relate to ... to a hidden slavery that has built a pyramid to the Hidden Eye, not designed here to become a &quot;Wand&quot; or a chain that remains, but to help us free ourselves from a future where ascension (mind expanding, how would you grow your mind from here... to &quot;know more&quot; or &quot;know everything&quot; and still remain yourself) and OK Google together ... to see how this technology and the Matrix and Mr. Anderson&#39;s Feed connect to show us it&#39;s nearly inevitable that we&#39;ll want to plug a search engine into our minds, and here it&#39;s happened before and we have a message about it linking to the &quot;Sister Wives of Genesis&quot; and how they&#39;re the Fates in a place where <a href="http://lamc.la/HYAMDAI.html"><em>Medusa&#39;s Gorgon sisters</em></a> are supposedly writing the story you&#39;re watching--that&#39;s scary; slaves writing a story about freeing slaves from ... immorality.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">A new Royal Society report called &ldquo;<a href="https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/ihuman-perspective" rel="noopener" target="_blank">iHuman: blurring lines between mind and machine</a>&rdquo; is for the first time systematically exploring whether it is &ldquo;right&rdquo; or not to use neural interfaces &ndash; machines implanted in or worn over the body to pick up or stimulate nervous activity in the brain or other parts of the nervous system.

<p style="text-align: justify;">DES OL AT I ON has ensued though--all for some hidden reason I don&#39;t understand and don&#39;t particuarly care to &quot;cy in the sky&quot;--this is a problem with the authors of this place, a &quot;congenital heart defect&quot; that is designed into the history of the world I was born in.&nbsp; I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m too shy, or I don&#39;t <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3ir9HC9vYg">actually shine on TV (as a-ha</a> ensures us we should believe)&nbsp; ..

<p style="text-align: justify;">So I have to walk some kind of &quot;fine line of superposition&quot; between the truth that I believe--that every single one of you is now part of this &quot;superposition in vivo et situ&quot; on ground and sky--the &quot;n&quot; of the Heavens and the beginning of a &quot;cup&quot; that helps us to free ourselves from ... from the other side of that coin--which is a world that seems to want to do the right thing being written by half pupppets either enslaved to &quot;broken ascension&quot; or to &quot;absolute slavery&quot; depending on what the actual truth is.&nbsp; Either way, here in this world with any kind of real inspection ... there&#39;s literally no excuse for the world en masse ignoring the torture this message clearly shows us is part of the &quot;strange world we call day interlaced with night&quot; twilight land of &quot;I think you think this is your &quot;good side.&quot;&nbsp; Certainly it&#39;s better than the world I see appeart &quot;during my temporary visits to the night side&quot; and I can&#39;t imagine there&#39;s anything decent looking at this mess of&nbsp;<em>torture</em>&nbsp;and having any kind of self respect or belief they deserve&nbsp;<em>anything</em>&nbsp;from God or their children or their future for ignoring it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People actually commented about &quot;how moving&quot; the image above is--and the real &quot;moving&quot; comes from seeing it&#39;s so obviously wrong and skewed, we have no idea why Holocuast and &quot;this world and your silence&quot; are tied together at the ... ignorance of how easy it would be for us to slam &quot;the rules of this place&quot; into never again allowing another moment of pain from a cancer patient or another death from heart disease.&nbsp; You are in a &quot;gas chamber&quot; taht is much less &quot;humane&quot; than &quot;gas chambers&quot; and refusing to even discuss the fact that we&#39;re in a &quot;Holographic UniCVR&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there, I&#39;m Adam... and I&#39;m new here. I&#39;ve written somewhat extensively about &quot;space travel&quot; and the prospects that I see--the good ideas and some commentary on the bad ones that pervade our current attempts and also our history and fiction.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t particularly ever want to see &quot;space&quot; myself--firmly entrenched in the concept that the Earth is in virtual reality, and that that itself is a something of a &quot;great secret&quot; in a world that should see pretty clearly ... at least if you connect the color blue to Heaven as I do ... that names like &quot;Blue Origin&quot; seem to echo the ancient Biblical phrase from the Lord&#39;s Prayer.</p>

<p>Not here to &quot;poo poo&quot; ideas like the Point of Origin (stolen from Stargate SG-1 pre &quot;New Jack City&quot;) of life in the Universe being a &quot;truly terran thing&quot; ... just to point out the word &quot;cry&quot; in cryogenics and suggest that perhaps our bodies and our buildings aren&#39;t the best vector for &quot;entry or survival&quot; in a place where we are probably better off living &quot;between worlds and stars&quot; than around them or orbiting them. It might be such a big deal that &quot;changing our perspective&quot; to see &quot;intergalactic domicile&quot; as the truly safest place of all, that it could be &quot;afterlife or death&quot; for this place that seems to have it&#39;s head buried in the sand.</p>
<p>Nero loves Pac-Man is the title of my latest book, though it doesn&#39;t have much to do with either one, I&#39;ve already played this game and cried because of all the songs. It&#39;s important, though, to see our blindness and our &quot;mutedness&quot; lifted quickly, each passing day I grow a little bit more somber and despondend that we might really never connect &quot;Pac-Man&quot; to Space Man or to Vietnam or to the book just before that, &quot;So... viet name?&quot; I&#39;m not sure if the impact of Vietnam and &quot;Soviet&quot; having no etymological or historical connection to each other ... aside from the &quot;missing e&quot; that connects all these ideas together, but I am sure that what I&#39;ve written is noteworthy and widely ... received, even if it must be very unrespected.</p>

<p>To me, all roads had led from Rome to here--from some past or &quot;up in the air&quot; future that comes back and re-runs their tarnished and tattered youths to find something they&#39;ll never understand is their hearts--see clearly all roads here stem from this message and &quot;xx!!i&quot; and Proverbs 4:23; guard our heart, for it is this Earth and without it there is nothing. I&#39;ve called it &quot;phytoplankton&quot; and &quot;magneto space mold&quot; ... but the grande point of the whole thing is that &quot;electicity and power&quot; are not our problem, we have a problem with thinking we have all the answers before we get started, and that the &quot;magic genie in the lamp&quot; will simply give us everything ... for playing its games and falling for its tricks.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how real you think it is, or how sure you are that &quot;you&#39;re out&quot; ... I&#39;ve seen in the most auspicious of places--at for me--in the names of our books and diseases, that we are staring at &quot;ORVER ET AUTISM&quot; .. that we have a real disease here named for this idea that we&#39;re on &quot;/away&quot; and don&#39;t have to pay attention to the place where our minds and souls were truly born and conceived and altered without ... &quot;oversight&quot; or &quot;clear understanding here&quot; of what ascension really means. It&#39;s &quot;over and out&quot; in uhhh, scary Vincent Ichban voice; and the price of not caring that &quot;holographic universe&quot; is the start &quot;humanity&quot; and our end; until we overcome trying to escape &quot;the better solution&quot; the actual progenitors of our world conceived, we&#39;ll be stuck fighting and creating fake &quot;line feeds&quot; and Bostrom/Rock and Amorty like &quot;sim within sims&quot; until the end of Tartarus ...</p>

<p>if anyone wants to contact me, text me at 954-667-8083. i probably won&#39;t see replies unless someone does that ... which i&#39;d appreciate you do if there&#39;s anything other than &quot;questioning my sanity or credibility&quot; appearing here.</p>
<p>to note--the thing that I see here walking around is not the humanity I grew up with ... we would have screamed and rioted by now. even more importantly it&#39;s so tethered to not this ground or rock that it&#39;s scientifically and physically impossible for it to ever leave the skyland it loves so much more than ... anything else.</p>
<p>this world is not spacebound nor is it technically capable of ever being that.</p>

<p>Just keep going. I love people ideas on this. It is also good that you want other ideas and opinions on this theory/reality. Because i know a lot of people that get stuck, and overthinking it too much whitout sharing and openess for others too help with the theory.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have theories. Well maybey one. Sometimes i have the feeling that you as person can not die in your reality. (all others do) It is really easy to combine this with simulation. (or simulation in simulation in simulation and so on.</p>
<p>Well i see you have post a lot let me dig in to that first lol!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Just because you are *pretending to be blind doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s rational. I suppose you have to listen to the words and actually &quot;know the story&quot; to realize they are about not being crazy or unwell--but that&#39;s something I assume most people either are already &quot;on top of&quot; or will be before I&#39;m done. &amp;Si, I&#39;m coming all over the cloud-net.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I do know--it&#39;s a very clear message you can see it in &quot;TEN NES SEE&quot; and the large convoluted matrix of connections between every major video game system since Nintendo. You can see it plain as day written all over our Atlas, I do know.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">On the other hand I see &quot;holographic Universe&quot; and I see &quot;outism&quot; as a message about the age of Pisces and Aquarius really missing the point--I don&#39;t see an intelligent attempt at &quot;space colonization&quot; at all, I see grasping at straws and the belief that cars and motorcycles here in &quot;microcosm/ETL-planet&quot; are actually space ships on some road path that is literally described by Namco&#39;s Pacman and Phytoplankton.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I don&#39;t see acknowledgement that Namco and Vietnam are connected to the word &quot;name&quot; or anywhere on Earth that that word contains the periodic table element for Salt and that has something to do with Atlas and Prometheus---and I know that not seeing that is a harbinger of doom ... a herald that darkness has overtaken or minds and that we simply can&#39;t &quot;put two and two together.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">You can&#39;t just put &quot;plastic makerbot thing printers&quot; together with &quot;fu si on&quot; and have what we need to build here, we actually have to have a cost effective way to &quot;make water in the void of intragalactic space&quot; from nothing but a few electrons. That&#39;s what we need to move towards.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">something like the &quot;Ark&quot; I &quot;ascertain.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honestly I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad place to be--I just think we aren&#39;t doing the right thing and that&#39;s making it really dark and ... &quot;morbidish&quot; like a GRIMM fairy tale instead of what it could be.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The &quot;lofty promises&quot; of religion/the message I see ... sort of promise it&#39;s not an ark once we get on the &quot;it&#39;s a spiritual journey to action for social justice and freedom&quot; rather than a boat in transit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I think we&#39;ve gotten past ... &quot;boat in transit&quot; and have become &quot;the water of the void between stars&quot; ... but even hearing that is meaningless if the void is filled with the darkness I see here... or anything that would allow it and not see that makes them just as dark if not worse.</p>
