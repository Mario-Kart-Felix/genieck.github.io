<span style="font-family:Arial">Pope Leo XIII’s Vision</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;In 1884, after saying Mass on the morning of, 
according to at least one source, October 13th, as he was leaving the Altar, the 
74 year old and frail Pope Leo XIII fell to the ground as if dead. One version 
has it that those around him thought for a few moments that he may have passed 
away. According to this version, a few minutes later, his breathing returned to 
normal and he revived.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Another version has it that as he was leaving 
the altar after a weekday low Mass, he paused as if in a trance for about 10 
minutes, turning ashen white. And yet another states that Pope Leo went into 
this trance while kneeling in attendance of a mass of thanksgiving after his own 
Mass that morning. See Appendix II for sources of written documentation on this 
subject.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">The Pope (born Joachim Vincent Pecci in 1810), 
according to the most common and popular version, 
related that he had experienced a sort of vision, in which he heard two voices, 
one of which he took to be that of Christ, gentle and kind, and the other that 
of Satan, guttural and harsh.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Satan said, “I could destroy Your Church if I 
had the time, and more power over those who give themselves over to my service.” 
And then Pope Leo heard Christ to answer, “You have the power, you have the 
time: 100 years.” (While some versions say 75 to 100 years, and others do not 
include a time frame, 100 years seems to be the time frame used in the most 
common versions; for reasons that will be given near the end of this booklet, it 
seems to this writer that the 100 year time frame is reasonable to use in light 
of what we see before us in 2007.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">It must be remembered that prophetic visions are 
given to warn, encourage, and instruct the faithful. So this vision is given to 
Pope Leo XIII in terms that he and we can understand. Some people logically ask, 
“Why would Christ give Satan more power?” The answer is that, since mankind is 
endowed with free will (rather than being created as robots), God, in effect, 
respects the free will in men. This vision would indicate that the sins of 
mankind were such that God, who sees all things, was warning the Pope that 
mankind, as a whole, was in the process of choosing a very difficult period 
ahead, by rejecting grace for short term advantage, unwholesome power, illicit 
pleasure, etc. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">The vision given to Pope Leo XIII was to warn 
mankind, but especially those trying to be faithful to Divine grace, of what lie 
ahead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">The reason I am writing this analysis of this 
vision in May-June of 2007 is that, it seems to me, we are likely in the midst 
of the era which Pope Leo foresaw in 1884; that we may also be living in the 
very years during which Satan is reaching the zenith of destructive power in the 
“100 years of Satan’s increased power”, which many say Pope Leo’s vision 
foretold. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">We all need encouragement to hold fast through 
this period, especially those who are destined to make it into the Great 
Chastisement, which Yves Dupont (author of the book, “Catholic Prophecy”, 1970) 
and other analysts of Catholic prophecy say will be the end of this age, that 
is, the end of the fifth period of the Church. The fifth period of the Church, 
according to Venerable Bartholomew Holzhauser (1613-1658), began in 1517 at the beginning of the Protestant revolt, 
and will last until the time of the 
Great Chastisement and the beginning of the Period of Peace (the Peace of 
Fatima) and the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The sixth period&nbsp; of 
the Church, the Period of Peace, according to Venerable Hozhauser, will last until the coming of AntiChrist and the end of the world, which is the 
seventh period of the Church.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family: Arial">For a brief discussion and explanation of the 
seven periods of the Church as delineated by Venerable Bartholomew Holzhauser, 
see Appendix 1.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250"><b>
<span style="font-family:Arial">The Saint Michael’s Prayer</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Shortly thereafter (after his vision), Pope Leo 
XIII composed the St. Michael’s prayer, which was published in the Raccolta in 
1886. A shortened version of this prayer was also composed and Pope Leo ordered 
it to be said after low Masses throughout the world. In 1930, Pope Pius XI 
attached the intention of the conversion of Russia to these prayers. The prayers 
at the foot of the altar were abruptly removed without explanation by John</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> XXIII (Angelo Roncalli) in 1962.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;Here’s a part of the original prayer that may 
greatly surprise many:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">“These most crafty enemies have filled and 
inebriated with gall and bitterness the Church, the spouse of the Immaculate 
Lamb, and have laid impious hands on her most sacred possessions.&nbsp; In the Holy 
Place itself, <b>where has been set up the See of the most holy Peter and the 
Chair of Truth for the light of the world, they have raised the throne of their 
abominable impiety, with the iniquitous design that when the Pastor has been 
struck, the sheep may be scattered</b>.” (emphasis added)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Thus, after this extraordinary vision, Pope Leo 
felt compelled to ask for St. Michael the Archangel’s help against the agents of 
Satan on earth whom he recognized already then as having “raised the throne of 
their abominable impiety” in “the Holy Place itself” with the “iniquitous design 
that when the Pastor has been struck, the sheep may be scattered.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;In other words, Pope Leo wanted the faithful to 
pray that the Church would not be forced to undergo something like the painful exile of the 
Papacy from Rome, as in the time in the 12<sup>th</sup> century when for eight 
years an antipope, Anacletus II (Pierleoni), usurped the Vatican while the true 
Pope, Innocent II (Gregory Paparaschi), fled Rome into central Europe. In those 
days, it wasn’t until St. Bernard of Clairvoix rallied the faithful and some 
Christian princes that the tide began to turn, resulting in the true Pope being 
restored to the Vatican. By vigorously and energetically opposing the forces of 
antichrist in his day, and eventually evicting the usurpers from Rome, some say 
St. Bernard of Clairvoix did more to influence the history of the world than 
anyone since the time of the Apostles themselves.</span></p>

WORD ABOUT VISIONS AND PRIVATE PROPHECIES</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family: Arial">T</span><span style="font-family:Arial">he general rule of the Catholic Church 
is to flee from unapproved private visions and private prophecies as if from temptation, to 
paraphrase St. </span><span style="font-family:
   Arial">John</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> of the Cross. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">However, certain private prophecies or visions 
from recognized holy persons or saints have been recognized by the Church in one 
way or another as “worthy of belief.” This does not mean that these private 
prophecies are binding on anyone’s faith, as are the public revelations which 
come from the Old Testament and the New Testament up until the death of the Last 
Apostle, St. </span><span style="font-family:
   Arial">John</span><span style="font-family:Arial">, in 91 A.D.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">When approved prophecies (worthy of belief, that 
is, having nothing in them against Faith or morals), which give the same 
message, come from many different saints or holy persons in many different 
countries, and from many different centuries, then we might be wise to take at 
least a passing notice. St. Paul</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> tells us to “Despise not prophecy,” (I Thess. 5:20, 21), that is, 
despise not Scriptural prophecy, or prophecy declared by the Church as worthy of 
belief, or which is allowed to be published as “credible” when such prophecies 
emanate from saints, holy persons, or learned and recognized Catholic scholars.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">The same goes for a vision of a Holy Pope, such 
as the 1884 vision of Pope Leo XIII.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250"><b>
<span style="font-family:Arial">WHEN DID THE 100 YEARS BEGIN?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">After Vatican II, as the crisis in the 
structures of the Catholic Church deepened to the point of great confusion and 
demoralization for those who were alert to what was taking place, discussion 
grew about the meaning of the vision of Pope Leo XIII.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">From the 1970s (when I first heard the of this 
vision), until quite recently, the assumption of &nbsp;everyone I heard discuss the 
“100 years of Satan’s increased power” as foreseen by Pope Leo XIII – was that 
the 100 years began right at the time of the vision, in 1884. That would mean 
that Satan’s time would have been up circa 1984.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">But nothing significant happened in 1984, 1985, 
or even in the 70s, 80s, and 90s – except that the crisis in Church and state 
deepened and worsened. In fact, the reign of evil that had been intensifying in 
the 20<sup>th</sup> century was increasing exponentially, as it still is today. 
(But, as is written by J.R.R. Tolkein in “Lord of the Rings”, good continues to 
exist, and even thrive in some places, side by side with this ominous shadow of 
evil.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">A few years ago, a friend of mine pointed out 
that an article in <i>Catholic Family News</i> had suggested that the 100 years 
of Satan’s increased power began in 1922. Why did the author of that article say 
1922? The author had reasoned that 1922 was the year that the last major Catholic 
Emperor, Karl I of Austria, had died. He had not abdicated his crown to which he 
recognized that he was bound by sacred oath. But he had stepped aside and gone 
into exile due to overwhelming political pressures brought about deliberately by 
the top Freemasons, which Emperor Karl I of the House of Hapsburg could not 
overcome at the close of the First World War. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">One of the purposes of the First World War 
(1914-1918), from the point of view of the forces of darkness, -- which had 
grasped control of the money-issuing power of the USA in 1913 through the 
Federal Reserve Act, -- was to topple all Catholic Monarchs from their thrones 
in Europe</span><span style="font-family:
Arial">. With the exception of a few miniscule countries like </span>
<span style="font-family:Arial">Liechtenstein and Monaco, this was accomplished.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">So, as the reasoning of this author goes, the 
death of the last major Catholic Monarch was symbolic of the apostasy of the 
nations from the Kingship of Christ, and thus the beginning of the 100 years of 
Satan’s increased power as revealed to Pope Leo XIII in 1884.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Incidentally, according to the book the 
“Incorruptibles” by Joan Carroll Cruz, Emperor Karl’s body was exhumed in 1972 
and found to be incorrupt, a sign of Divine favor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">You can read about that and much else about 
Emperor Karl I here:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family: Arial; background-color: #FFFF00">In any case, this 
idea that the 100 years of Satan’s increased power may have started <i>later</i> 
than 1884 -- was a tremendous “light bulb” moment for me; a breakthrough. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Of course, I thought, after hearing about this 
article which had run in <i>Catholic Family News</i>: why did we all assume that 
the 100 years of Satan’s increased power over the world began in 1884? The 1884 
vision was a prophecy, meaning it was probably something that would start well 
after the year of 1884.</span></p>

<span style="font-family:Arial">The Case for 1914 as the beginning of Satan’s 
100 Years of Increased Power</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">There is a rationale to make the case that 1914 
was the beginning of the 100 years of Satan’s Increased Power. 1914 was the year 
in which the evil hierarchy of Judeo-Masonry actually took over the 
money-issuing power of the United States of America through the Federal Reserve 
Act.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">The Federal Reserve is actually a private 
organization which Congress has never audited since 1914. This means that the 
Jewish banksters who run the FED have been able to issue themselves and their 
projects all the money they have wanted, in secret, to advance their evil 
agenda. This is a subject in itself, and would not have been possible if modern 
means of mass production had not made material goods so universally available in 
the USA. As long as the money issued does not greatly exceed the goods and 
services available, then runaway inflation does not happen. The FED Banksters 
have been able to “skim the cream off the top” of the economy for their own 
projects. In the natural order, this is where the power of the evil hierarchy of 
Judeo-Masonry has come from since 1914. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Those familiar with history may object that the 
Federal Reserve Act (which delegated the money-issuing power of the </span>
<span style="font-family:
  Arial">USA</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> to this deceptively named private company) was passed in 1913. This is 
true. This bill was passed amidst whiskey bottles, bribes, arm twisting, and 
unwholesome revelry on </span><span style="font-family:Arial">December 23, 1913 
– right before the Christmas break, when many Senators and Congressman had left 
town already. But the FED banksters did not begin operating the money system of 
the USA until after New Year’s day of 1914, which is the salient point for this 
discussion. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">The FED was involved in funding the Communist 
takeover of Russia, causing the Great Depression in 1929 by contracting the 
currency overnight, funding Nazism, funding anti-Christ Zionism (takeover of 
Palestine in 1948), Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, the Woodrow Wilson Presidency, 
the FDR Presidency, etc., etc., etc. It also has funded many think tanks (Tavistock 
Institute, Brookings Institute, etc., etc., etc.) which have been the guiding 
forces behind the cultural subversion that the West has experienced over the 
last century.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">1914 was also the year that Pope St. Pius X 
died. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">After telling a group at a certain gathering 
(Sacred Heart Enthronement in a friend's local home) about the CFN article 
referenced above, and discussing the possibility that 1922 or 1917 may have been 
the beginning of the 100 years of Satan’s increased power, a priest who was 
there then suggested to me at the end of the evening, as the group of friends 
was breaking up, that the death of St. Pius X was one strong indication that the 
100 years of Satan’s increased power may have begun in that year.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">He also pointed out that this date would include 
World War I – which began in 1914. WW I was the most vicious of all the wars of 
the 20<sup>th</sup> century in one respect, that is, it entailed the most 
suffering for the soldiers. The weapons were crude. Soldiers lay dying for weeks 
with infections and open wounds in the trenches of Europe. (In WW II, the 
weapons were so powerful that people often died instantly, or at least more 
quickly.) </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">St. Malachy, who gave a phrase to all the Popes 
down through the centuries, had called Pope Benedict XV (1914-1922) “the 
depopulation of Christendom.” This would signify World War I, where Christians 
were killing Christians in an absolutely senseless war engineered by the 
Judeo-Masonic banksters. Pope St. Pius X had also indicated that, after he died, 
the depopulation of Christendom would begin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">There is another possible reason to suggest that 
1914 may be the year when Pope Leo’s vision began. 100 years after 1914 would be 
2014. Several of the ancient pagan/satanic religions, such as the Mayan culture, 
state that their “prophets” could not and can not see anything past the year 
2012. Many occultists today say the same thing, for whatever that is worth. This 
has been all the rage on shows that like to dabble in the occult, such as the 
Art Bell show (now hosted by George Noory), heard just about everywhere in the 
USA on overnight AM radio from 1997 until the present year of 2007. Now, while 
the devil cannot see the future, he can make deductions from that which is 
revealed somewhere by God to favored souls, such as Anna Catherine Emmerick, for 
instance. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">So, if the devil figured out through the 
revelations of some holy person, perhaps unknown to us, that the year of 2013 
was the year of the beginning of the Great Chastisement, or the year that began 
the count down to the Great Chastisement, which would be the end of this age, 
and a worldwide return to the True Faith, and the beginning of the Period of 
Peace (Peace of Fatima), -- then he might not want those he has deceived in 
those false religions to get any hint of any of this. Thus, perhaps, he does not 
help such occult “seers” to have visions of anything after that date, or perhaps 
God does not grant Satan the power to “inspire” these false seers to envision 
anything after that date.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">It must be said that the period from 1884 (Pope 
Leo’s vision) to 1914 (death of Pope St. Pius X and beginning of WW I) contained 
no major events to even compare with the evil turmoil that began for the world 
in 1914 – and which is still accelerating to this day, as this is written, in 
May and June of 2007.</span></p>

<span style="font-family:Arial">1917 --- YEAR OF DESTINY FOR OUR TIME</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">In 1917, the background Judeo-Masonic network 
finally succeeded in taking control of its first country: Russia. There had been 
many failed attempts, or partial successes, such as the French Revolution in 
1789, the revolutions of 1848, and the failed revolution in Russia in 1905. The 
Russian Empire was comprised of a tremendous land mass with astounding wealth. 
The Romanov family had ruled Russia for 500 years. The Communists (the 
police-tyranny arm for the background Judeo-Masonic banksters), captured the 
Romanov family as they took over Russia with the help of the evil administration 
of President Woodrow Wilson and New York financiers such as Jacob Schiff. They 
eventually forced the Czar, while in captivity with his family, to sign over 
ownership of all the mines, etc. in </span><span style="font-family:

to sell the riches of </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Russia to western 
Jewish bankers and businessmen. Cleveland businessman Armand Hammer was 
immediately working with his fellow Jews in Russia to arrange business deals in 
1918. This fact is often mentioned in history books or books about the career of

<span style="font-family:Arial">Finally, the Czar and his family were killed in

<span style="font-family:Arial">As all of the above was in the process of 
happening, from May 13<sup>th</sup> to October 13<sup>th</sup>, in 1917, Our 
Lady of Fatima appeared to the 3 shepherd children in Portugal. The Miracle of 
the Sun was witnessed by 70,000 people and took place on October 13, 1917. This 
astounding event, also witnessed and written up by secular newspaper men who had 
come to mock the day, was predicted well in advance by one of the seers, the 
young Lucy dos Santos. It has turned out to be the most dramatic public miracle 
in the entire Christian era, and some say it is referred to in the beginning of 
Chapter 12 of the Apocalypse, i.e., ‘the woman clothed with the sun.” </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial">What follows is an “off the cuff” HISTORY OF THE 
YEARS between 1914 and the present with regard to evil developments which 
favored the rule of Satan’s agents over this world, as well as the conditions 
which might cause people to fall into temptation and lose their immortal souls 
(Satan’s main goal.) Even this off-the-cuff list makes it clear that the march 
of events in the years since 1914 are the most dire in recorded history, and 
could believably be “Satan’s 100 years of increased power”, as foreseen by Pope 
Leo XIII in 1884.</span></p>

<span style="font-family:Arial">* World War I, resulting in the deaths of 
millions of Christians in Europe</span><span style="font-family:
Arial">, for no good reason whatsoever, although there were plenty of bad 
reasons why the Judeo-Masonic banksters had set up and funded this war.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">* All the major Catholic monarchies were toppled 
during or after World War I, including the Hapsburg Empire. This fulfilled a 
long goal of Judeo-Masonry.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">* The Jewish Banksters, such as Rothschild and 
Warburg, took control of the issuing of US money, and were allowed to do so in 
secret, and without audit. (1914) </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">* As World War I ended, the banksters funded 
primarily Jewish revolutionaries to topple the Czar and takeover Russia, making 
it the first Communist run country. (One of the dire predictions if not enough 
prayer and penance was done – was that “Russia would spread her errors 
throughout the world&quot;, which is still in the process of happening today.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">* The FED banksters were able to engineer the 
Great Depression in 1929 by manipulation of the currency. A top Communist 
Revolutionary, Rakovsky, said that when the history of the Communist revolution 
was finally written that the Great Depression in the United States would be 
looked at as more important than the Communist takeover of Russia. He said that 
this was the case because it destroyed the power of the Christians in the United 
States to resist the monetary power of the Jewish Banksters.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">* Christian Ukrainians were slaughtered and 
starved to death by the tens of millions by the Communists. The property and 
machinery of all the farmers was taken over by the Communist state, and thus the 
Russians and Ukrainians went from being proud independent farmers – to being 
“communized” or reduced to living as virtual slaves on the big “commune” called 
the Soviet Union.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">* The Jewish banksters funded the rise of Hitler 
and Nazism for several reasons: so that Hitler would begin screaming &quot;anti-semitism&quot; and 
eventually round up European Jews to force those selected down to Palestine, with 
a view to the takeover of Palestine (which happened in 1948), and to put those not chosen for Palestine 
into concentration camps for the “Holocaust.” The “Holocaust” was a preconceived 
plan of the Jewish Banksters for the purpose of fastening on the Germans and the 
rest of humanity an “eternal guilt trip.” 
Most of the top Nazi leaders were half Jewish. The top Jews who engineered the 
&quot;Holocaust&quot; also planned to supplant the Crucifixion of Christ with the 
“crucifixion of the Jewish people” as the central event in human history. In 
fact, many everyday Jewish people were caught up in this manufactured nightmare. Many were unjustly 
killed, and even one person unjustly killed is an infinite outrage in God's 
eyes. The &quot;Holocaust&quot; can best be understood by thinking of a psychopath trying 
to get sympathy for his family -- by killing part of his family. This is what 
the top anti-Christ Jewish banksters did to the everyday Jews of Europe.&nbsp; However, the true 
history is far different from the myth pushed by Hollywood and the Big Media 
(both owned by the top Zionist Jews). Those left in the concentration camps died 
primarily of malnutrition and disease as the war came to an end and food supply 
lines broke down. Best estimates 
are that somewhere between 
300,000 and 1.2 million everyday Jews were murdered, or left to die, by the 
Nazis and Communists (both, remember, financed by the same Rothschild/Warburg 
Jewish Bankster hierarchy)&nbsp; during World War II. The &quot;6 million&quot; Jewish 
victims of the Nazis, which is the “Holocaust” &quot;doctrine&quot;, is simply exaggerated 
and false. This truth about World War II is such a mind-boggling concept for most people who 
have been brainwashed by the Jewish-run major media today, that we refer the curious 
to these websites for more information about the real nature and purpose of 
“Nazism”:</span></p>

Yassin, in which 200 men, women, and children were killed by surprise 
attack. Then the Zionist invaders rode throughout Palestine in trucks with loud speakers 
telling the Arabs to leave or they would be killed also. This was the founding 
of “Israel”, born in lies and murder, and sustained by lies and murder (see St.

resisting the Soviet occupiers -- they found powdered milk. Here we see in 
action the greatest weapon used by the forces of evil once they take power: 
false opposition. The Hungarian freedom fighters expected help from the

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">* During the 1950s and 1960s, audio and video is developed 
to the point where television sets are bought by almost every home. At first the 
entertainment seems relatively harmless, but as the mid 1960s arrive, movies and 
television take a turn for the worse, which plummet continues to this day. (It 
is the judgement of this writer. the the top echelons of Judeo-Masonry knew that 
they had installed their men in the Vatican -- John XXIII, 1958-1963, and Paul 
VI, 1963-1978, -- and they knew that the occupied Vatican would step out of the 
way and allow the inundation of the world with immorality and anti-Christ 
propaganda to proceed without opposition. Thus the prediction of Our Lady of 
Lasallete seem to reach fulfillment: that immorality would fill the very air as 
a pestilence.&nbsp; The 
Judeo-Masonic hierarchy finally had a means to brainwash people on a daily 
basis, namely, via the television set in their home. (This is not to say that the 
technology of television is per se immoral, but that without any effective 
restraining forces this technology has been used for evil by Hollywood and the 
major television networks.)</span></p>

the aftermath of which will throw the Catholic faithful into total confusion, 
due to all the abrupt changes which break sharply from tradition and sanity. It 
is clear at this juncture that engineers of Vatican Council II were conducting a 
full scale demolition operation, not trying to implement benevolent changes 
which went awry.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">* 1965: President LB John</span><span style="font-family:

<span style="font-family:Arial">US immigration policy. After a basic moratorium 
on immigration from 1924 to 1965, </span><span style="font-family:
 Arial">John</span><span style="font-family:Arial">son moved the immigration 
ratio for 90% European to 90% third world. This is not to denigrate the third 
worlders who want to come to the USA, but the motivation of this change was the 
agenda of top Jewish Supremists to make the white peoples of European descent in 
the USA an eventual minority in the nation their forefathers had built. With the 
Jewish control of Europe after World War II, through the power of the US 
military, the Judeo-Masonic hierarchy opened the floodgates of immigration to 
Europe to Moslems and other third worlders, with a view to making white 
Europeans a minority  in Europe as well. By 2007, this process is far 
advanced, and President G.W. Bush is trying to finish off the white majority in 
the USA by giving amnesty to 20 million illegal immigrants from south of the 
border which are in the country. The significance of this is that, despite 
current disorientation, the European 
peoples have always been the advancers of the true Faith. As Hillaire Belloc 
said, “The Faith is </span><span style="font-family:
 Arial">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Arial">; and Europe</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> is the Faith.” The top Jews realize that they have a better chance of 
holding power if they cause each country to become a battle ground between 
competing ethnic groups, and they also realize that their main opposition, and 
eventual defeat, has always come historically through the European peoples.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">* 1967-71; Drugs are introduced to middle class 
families in the USA en masse through 
the senseless Vietnam War and through the evolution of “rock and roll” music 
into a full scale promotion and sanctioning of drugs about 1967. Groups such as the 
Beatles, having shown talent as entertainers, are sponsored and guided by the Tavistock 
institute in England. The full fury of degeneracy is unveiled in the Rolling 
Stones. In Vietnam, the soldiers, put under incredible psychological pressure 
by being prevented from following those attacking them beyond certain arbitrary 
lines imposed by those atop the US Government, and being sent out on patrols for 
8 hours at a time through thick jungles where they could be killed at any moment 
by Viet Cong camouflaged up in trees, were then offered drugs for the purpose of 
&quot;escaping&quot; at the end of the day. Many of these soldiers then, hooked on drugs 
in Vietnam, then bring drugs back into middle 
class America. Jewish operatives like Jerry Rubin Abby Hoffman, and Marc Rudd, 
(all of student age in the sixties) are paid by large foundations to introduce 
and promote 
drugs and “free sex” via birth control on college campuses as quickly as 
possible. (Jewish operative late Jerry Rubin told the college kids in the late 
1960s not to trust anyone over 30 -- a ploy to drive a wedge between Christian 
children and their parents; after Rubin turned 30, he became a Jewish stock 
broker on Wall Street -- simply taking up another, equally comfortable role for 
him, as a Jewish operative trying to destroy Christian America.)</span></p>

* Circa 1971, a combination of Jewish and Masonic forces destroy the remaining

“annulments” granted by the post-Vatican II authorities in the structures of the

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">* Circa 1973, the Judeo-Masonry hierarchy, with 
full cooperation of the Democratic and Republican parties at the local, state, 
and national levels, begin imposing computerized Vote-counting systems on the 
population through three major companies, all controlled by this same hierarchy. 
County election officials inexplicably delegate authority to count the votes to 
these mega-computer companies. Wherever these systems are imposed, ballots are 
snatched from the neighborhood polling places at closing time (in one way or 
another), and are counted in secret behind police guard which is instructed to bar candidates, 
news media, and citizens from observing what is happening during the &quot;count.&quot;. The process 
of computerized Votescam is pretty much completed by 1988. Today, in 2007, 49 
states and ½ of New Hampshire allow 4 major companies (Diebold, ES &amp; S, Hart, 
and Sequoia) to “count” the US vote. Thus, any state or national election can be 
easily rigged, in secret, by these four Judeo-Masonically controlled 
computer companies. (Recounts are allowed only after giving three weeks notice 
to the local Board of election, during which time all ballots can be switched to 
make the computer &quot;count&quot; seem correct.) </span></p>

<span style="font-family:Arial">* 1974, the last US President to significantly

<span style="font-family:Arial">* 1991: on February 24 the ground attack begins

it would be OK if he did that, as Kuwait was taken from Iraq in 1915 or so by 
the British for the oil on that land; this set-up of Hussein, gave Bush the excuse to attack, thus 
beginning the permanent presence of US troops in the Mideast to protect Israel, 
help Israel expand its borders, and try to bring the Arab states under the 
Jewish controlled Federal Reserve Bank. 10,000 US soldiers from the Gulf War 
eventually die of mysterious causes (thought to be the vaccines they were given, 
or radiation from depleted uranium used on&nbsp; equipment by the soldiers in Iraq) and 160,000 US soldiers file for 
disability after the 1991 Gulf War. This story is all but totally suppressed in

<span style="font-family: Arial">* Also, </span>
<span style="font-family:Arial">Clinton does 
away with all guards against monopolies, thus allowing the banksters to begin 
taking over all major industries in the nation without restraint. Since the 
banksters already have total monopoly on issuing money in secret to themselves, 
it was a small step to start taking over industries once the barriers to 
monopoly were again removed. The new monopolies operate behind three or four 
companies -- all controlled by the same crowd. An example would be Office Depot, 
Staples, and Office Max, three companies which wiped out 75% of the family and 
regionally owned office supply companies in the USA between their sudden 
appearance in 1987-88 and 1998 (all three companies are Jewish owned; all three 
companies got unlimited loans from the Jewish-controlled Fed banking system, 
came in with first class-everthing, and unlimited adverstising budgets -- and 
just lost money until they drove all the family operations out of business -- at 
which point they began to make money (!).&nbsp; People in 2007 would most 
quickly recognize the big Media monopoly, the oil Monopoly which keeps the local 
stations' 
gas prices rising and falling in unison (to the penny). and the usurious 
monopoly of banks and credit card companies, which has imposed on Americans in 
many cases 28% interest rates, and  $30+ fees for every 
bounced check -- at all banks. However, the banksters are grasping for a monopoly 
on all major industries, thus bringing in an updated version of Communism to the 
world, where ownership is in the hands of a very few at the top, with the vast majority of 
humanity drone workers, serfs, or slaves. For instance, the grandfather owned

witnesses the 
maturing of the internet, which came into general public awareness around 1996. While 
not evil in itself, the internet is again used for evil. Primarily the evil is 
the making available pervasively, over every computer potentially, gross sexual 
immorality. This immorality even goes beyond what anyone could have imagined 
when Our Lady of Fatima warned that many fashions would be introduced which 
would very much offend Our Lord. However, to repeat, the prophecy of Lasalette (1846), 
spoke of the very air carrying the pestilence of immorality and impurity (that’s 
a paraphrase), and this seems to have to come to fruition with the maturing of 
the internet. Now, in 2007, news reports indicate that with Ipods and even cell 
phones, immoral images will be accessible to any person who owns one. Needless 
to say, almost all teenagers in the USA now have these devices.</span></p>

<span style="font-family:Arial">THIS FITS WITH “CATHOLIC PROPHECY” BY YVES 
DUPONT</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">The book “Catholic Prophecy” was published by 
Yves Dupont through TAN books in 1970. Dupont warned that the confluence of 
Catholic prophecies from many holy persons, saints, countries and centuries – 
indicated that we were in the fifth period of the Church, which begins in 1517 
with the Protestant revolt led by Martin Luther. Dupont indicated that this 
fifth period would be marked by the precipitous decline of Church and state, 
ending with a Great Chastisement, possibly brought about by the tail of Comet 
passing through the earth’s atmosphere, causing the much talked about 3 days of 
darkness. After this catastrophe, or Great Chastisement, only 1/3 of the 
population of the earth would be found to survive. However, the powers of evil 
would be shattered, the Catholic Church would rise again under a Holy Pope and a 
Great Monarch, who would be the help and protection of the Church. The whole 
world would be converted to Catholicism, including the Muslims, Russia, and 
China.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">A word must be said here about a Chapter in 
Dupont’s “Catholic Prophecy” entitled “The End of the World.” Dupont argues, I 
think persuasively, that the end of the world comes in two phases. The first 
phase, he argues, is the period we are in which he suggests Christ Himself 
referred to when He said, “But the end is not yet” in St. Matthew 24:6, and when 
He said that, “But these things are the beginning of sorrows” in St. Matthew 
24:8. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Dupont argues that the signs of the “Beginning 
of the End” and the “actual end of the world” are very much the same, with the 
signs at the end of the world being even more intense than what we see unfolding 
today. Between the beginning of the end, and the actual end of the world, Dupont 
argues that the prophecy about “the Gospel is to be preached in the whole 
world”, Matthew 24:14, will be realized.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">This will happen, Dupont says, during the Great 
Peace which is to follow the Great Chastisement. This “Great Peace” would 
coincide with, and actually be, what has come to be called the “Peace of Fatima” 
since 1917. Some, including Dupont, say this peace would last only two or three 
generations, while others, such as Fr. Sylvester Berry, writing circa 1921, 
argues that it would last for 400 or 500 years, to equal and undo the damage 
done by the Protestant revolution, which would be 500 years old in 2017. I 
personally favor Fr. Berry’s view, if for no other reason that it would take two 
or three generations just to begin to restore the world back to where it was 
when the Great Chastisement hits and destroys most of the advancements of the 
modern world, returning the world for a time to a very agrarian society.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family: Arial">(It should be noted that as well as Luther 
started the Protestant Revolt in 1517, Freemasonry in its modern form re-emerged 
in 1717, and, as already noted, the Communists took over Russia in 1917. These 
years all ending in 17 could be viewed as a reason why 2017 might be an 
important year in the ending of the 100 years of Satan's increased power, and 
the emergence of the Peace of Fatima.)</span></p>

<span style="font-family:Arial">MOST COMPELLING REASON WHY THE GREAT 
CHASTISEMENT AND THE END OF THE ECLIPSE OF THE CHURCH MAY BE NEAR</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">However, all I have presented does not provide 
the most compelling reason why the end of the 100 years of Satan’s increased 
power may happen in the next 7 to 15 years, i.e., between 2014 and 2022. The 
next section explains the most compelling reason why the years of Satan’s 
increased power, which arguably begin circa 1914, are coming to and end in the 
relatively near future (circa 2014 to 2022).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Let’s look at this prophecy from St. Nicholas of 
Fluh, who lived in the 15<sup>th</sup> century: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">“The Church will be punished because the 
majority of her members, high and low, will become so perverted. The Church will 
sink deeper and deeper until she will at last seem to be extinguished, and the 
succession of Peter and the other Apostles will at last seem to have expired. 
But, after this, she will be victoriously exalted in the sight of all doubters.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">The above prophecy seems to talk of something 
which is from a Fairy Tale, or something that would happen far away, and far in 
the future. Maybe so. But if one view is correct, then we are living through it. 
This view is explained at
<a href="http://www.october1958.com/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
www.october1958.com</a> – and is beyond the scope of this paper, except for a 
brief summary.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">By this view we are living through the Eclipse 
of the Church, as predicted by Our Lady of Lasalette in 1846. This vision was 
approved by Pope Pius IX and a basilica was built on the spot of the Apparition 
by Pope Leo XIII. Part of the vision, as relayed by the primary seer, Melanie Calvet, was that “Rome will lose the Faith and become the Seat of Anti-Christ.” 
(Not necessarily THE Anti-Christ, but at least the forces of antichris</span><span style="font-family:
Arial">t.) </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Another part of the Lasalette message said, “The 
Church will be in Eclipse, the world will be in dismay.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Again we see the heavenly economy of language 
expressing profound truths. In an eclipse the sun (Church) remains in existence, 
but it is temporary blocked from view by the moon (counterfeit church, to use 
the phrase of Anna Catherine Emmerich, mystic nun, circa 1821).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Practically, this would mean, based on the 
history we have seen unfold, that the Vatican 
was taken over by a coup d’etat (sudden overthrow of a government by persons in 
authority or formerly in authority) during the conclave in 1958. This would mean 
that in 1958 a group of cardinals, themselves probably willingly having joined 
the freemasons, or Freemasons from the beginning, or blackmailed, cooperated in getting one cardinal elected Pope 
(evidence points to Cardinal Joseph Siri of Genoa), and then, with the help of 
pre-arranged outside threats (including a nuclear threat to end the Vatican 
States existence if Siri were not shoved aside, see oblique reference in Malachi 
Martin's book, &quot;Keys of this Blood&quot;, pages 600 10 610), overthrowing Siri and replacing 
him with an agent of Judeo-Masonry (Roncalli, who took the name of an anti-Pope, 
John</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> XXIII,1400-1415, an unheard of name choice for a Pope). Thus, the 
Eclipse of the Church would have begun in 1958, and all decisions coming out of 
the Vatican from that day until this (in May-June 2007) would have been 
illegitimate, coming from the Judeo-Masonic counterfeit church, and not from the 
true Church, which was now hidden from world view in the Vatican, -- and eventually 
hidden from world view in every parish in the world (by the time of the 
imposition of the New Mass in 1969). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Of all the illegitimate and anti-Catholic 
changes coming from the post-1958 Vatican, the one with the most devastating 
consequences would be the suppression of the true rite of Episcopal 
consecration, used in the making of Bishops. According to this view, this true 
rite was “eclipsed” by the mendacious rite put forth in 1969 by anti-pope Paul</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> VI.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Pope Pius XII, responding to requests from 
various bishops around the world, and no doubt under the inspiration of the Holy 
Ghost, defined the essential words for the rite of consecration of Bishops in 
1947. The words he defined had long been used in all the Episcopal consecration 
rites of the Church.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">So why would Paul</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> VI feel the need to eliminate these words 22 years later – and replace 
them with words that did not in any way refer explicitly to the making of 
Bishops?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">The answer is that Paul</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> VI was an agent of Judeo-Masonry, a spiritual descendant of Caiaphas the 
High Priest who engineered the crucifixion of Christ 2000 years ago. (</span><span style="font-family:Arial">St.
</span><span style="font-family:
   Arial">John</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> 11: 49, 50) By this view 
then, Paul</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> VI, who often wore in public the Jewish Ephod which Caiaphas wore, was 
trying to condemn Apostolic Succession to death (i.e. condemn the Church to 
death) by maliciously removing the essential words for Episcopal consecration, 
and putting in their place words which did not signify the grace of the 
sacrament (a necessity for validity according to the Church’s sacramental 
theology).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">And so, by this view, what are the consequences of this action 
by </span><span style="font-family:
 Arial">Paul</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> VI? The consequences are 
that all of the Bishops consecrated using the New Rite since 1969 – are invalid. This means that 
all the bishops made under Paul</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> VI, </span><span style="font-family:Arial">John </span>
<span style="font-family:
 Arial">Paul</span><span style="font-family:Arial">s I and II, and Benedict XVI 
are invalid. This means that all the priests made by these bishops are invalid. 
One astute analyst called the New Rite of Paul</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> VI “Caiaphas’s Revenge”, i.e., the attempt to bring an end to Apostolic 
succession – and make Christ’s promise to &quot;be with His Church always&quot; null and void, if 
such were possible.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Today, in 2007, the conclusion would be that there are approximately 70 
bishops appointed by Pope Pius XII still living. These are bishops with both 
validity and ordinary jurisdiction. The bishops made in the New Rite are 
invalid, and also lack jurisdiction. The bishops made in the Lefebvre, Thuc, and 
Mendez lines – have validity, but lack ordinary jurisdiction from a Pope. While 
traditionalists may protest that they have valid bishops, ordained in the old 
and true rite, the Freemasons can respond, “Yes, but you are no different than 
the Old Roman Catholic Bishops, because you have no jurisdiction from a Pope.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Therefore, with the Pius XII bishops dying off 
and with their numbers spiraling towards zero, it would seem necessary that God 
will move through Our Lady of Fatima to save His Church in the very near future. 
THIS is the strongest argument, in my mind, why the Great Chastisement may come 
in the next 7 to 22 years, bringing an end to the 5<sup>th</sup> period of the 
Church, and ushering in the Period of Peace which will be the triumph of the 
Immaculate Heart of Mary</span><span style="font-family:
Arial">, as promised by Our Lady at Fatima in 1917 (“In the end, my Immaculate 
Heart will triumph.”)</span></p>

<span style="font-family:Arial">SATANIC FORCES SEEMS TO BE GETTING FRANTIC</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Any one watching closely the progression of news 
events since the terror attacks of 9-11, can see that the forces of evil seem to 
be getting frantic. Talk of nuking Iran has even become commonplace on talk 
radio and elsewhere – as if it 
were a normal option to begin discussing. Some operations of the other side have 
failed: like the instantly discredited claim of James Cameron, director of the 
movie “Titanic”, that he and a group of archeologists had found a tomb with the 
bones of Jesus, as well as the bones of Mary</span><span style="font-family:
 Arial"> Magdalene</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> and a child named 
“Judas.” (This was to indicate that Judas was Christ’s favorite Apostle, so he 
named his kid after him! This was to be part of the absurd &quot;rehabilitation of Judas project&quot; 
which has failed to catch on.) There was also the attempt to 
foist upon the world, the Gospel of Judas, “discovered” in 1947 or so. While 
these attempts at faith-weakening deception were quickly slapped down, the mere 
fact that they are being attempted – seems to be proof that Satan realizes his 
time for his 100 years of increased power is about up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Within the structures of the Church, Benedict 
XVI seems have one program: put Light and darkness side by side, and have 
Catholics acknowledge both as legitimate. Seeing that there is no hope of having 
the average person at this point reject Jesus and the Church overtly, the best 
that can be done is to get most of these same people to acknowledge false rights 
and false doctrines as “legitimate” alongside the truths of the Church.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Thus, we hear a lot about the significance of Benedict XVI’s approval of the tridentine rite for 
more general use. While this sounds good 
if you don’t have a clue as to what is going on, the fact is that these tridentine Masses, where they are said, will now be said by younger “priests” 
who are not priests at all, because they were ordained by the New Rite Bishops 
of Paul VI. However, this ploy will serve to fool as many Catholics as possible 
to stay under Benedict XVI and the counterfeit church, as the forces of darkness 
try to “run out the clock” so that no one is left alive who even remembers the 
Church as it existed before Vatican II (1962-1965) and before the 1958 Conclave.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">And, indeed, this is another reason to postulate 
that the Great Chastisement may begin in the next 7 to 15 years. If we get much 
past 2022, no one will be left alive who remembers the Church up until the death 
of Pope Pius XII in 1958. It is difficult for young “traditional Catholics” to 
imagine that at one time every Latin Rite parish church throughout the world was saying the tridentine Mass in Latin, 
or one of the traditional liturgies in the case of the much smaller eastern 
rites.. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">While those around my age (born circa 1953), 
have memories of the Church in normal times, often up to about 1965, it was 
around that time when major changes, such as guitar masses and the “table” being 
placed in front of the altar facing the people, were imposed on Catholics 
worldwide by the Paul</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> VI controlled Vatican. Thus, it seems likely to me that God will act to 
save His Church while there are still individuals alive who can testify to 
realities of the 
Church in normal times in the 1950s,  to which the Church is to be restored  after the rise of the Great Monarch and the Holy Pope, who is to “restore all 
things.”</span></p>

<span style="font-family:Arial">WORST FEATURE OF THE LAST 100 YEARS?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">The Gospel tells us to fear not those who can 
kill the body, but those who can kill the soul. (St. Matthew, 10:28) Therefore, 
it is logical that Satan’s main goal would be to cut off the sources of 
sanctifying grace (the seven sacraments) by blocking the normal operation of the 
Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">How could this possibly be done? In light of Our 
Lady of Lasalette, the answer jumps out at us: “The Church will be in Eclipse, 
the world will be in dismay.” Overthrow the Pope, takeaway the Mass, and 
eventually takeaway as many of the other sacraments of the Church as possible 
via invalid bishops and invalid priests. As the Mass and sacraments are replaced 
(eclipsed) with counterfeit sacraments wherever possible, sanctifying grace is 
blocked, -- and the world as a whole experiences the greatest and most rapid 
cultural and freefall decline perhaps in history (1965 to 2007), i.e., the world 
is increasingly in dismay.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<font face="Arial">In this writer's opinion, the most insightful line written 
since the current, acute crisis in the Catholic Church began in 1958, comes from 
the pen of Gary Giuffre in the article, &quot;The Pope who will wear Red&quot; published 
in 1989: &quot;This false church of darkness could not deceive the faithful if it did 
not present to the world its own false “pope” or succession of “popes” as the 
“legitimate” authority in the Catholic Church.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Thus, with the usual channels of sanctifying 
grace slowed to a trickle from a few priests here and there, the world is 
largely deprived of the means given by Christ to overcome Satan, the prince of 
this world. In addition, more and more human beings are living habitually in 
mortal sin -- without caring about their condition, or even thinking about it as 
an issue. This is the greatest crisis of our time – and it is the reason why 
the world is in dismay.</span></p>

<span style="font-family:Arial">Likewise, the Church, the Mystical Body of

Benedictine monk, writing in 1974:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">“ The Church is the Mystical Christ and as such 
must relive through the ages the mysteries of the Saviour’s life, Good Friday 
not excepted. </span><span style="font-family:

<span style="font-family:Arial">“. . . those writers do a great disservice to 
souls who assert that this or that thing cannot happen to the Church, or the 
Papacy, or the majority of the faithful. When Peter spoke like that, the Lord 
said to him: ‘Get thee behind Me, Satan.’ Mutatis mutandis, anything can happen 
to the Church, and in fact may be predicted to happen, if it happened in the 
life of Our Lord. For the Church is His Mystical Bo</span><span style="font-family:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">“It follows therefore that the Church can be 
betrayed and made a prisoner; can be buffeted, spat upon, be made to look a 
fool; she can be defamed, abandoned, condemned; she can be damaged structurally 
and disfigured, like the Lord’s physical members were; in a word, she can be 
crucified and [seemingly] put to death – but not for long!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">“From three o’clock on Good Friday until three 
A.M. on Easter was only thirty-six hours. And as there was a faithful remnant 
left to Jesus even then, so will it be in the Good Friday of the Church; there 
will be a faithful few to wait in sorrow for the Church’s Resurrection, which 
will burst like lightning upon God’s enemies.” (From Kyrie Eleison Newsletter,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">In summary, there are many indicators that we 
are in 
the latter decades of the 100 years of Satan’s increased power, as foreseen by 
Pope Leo XIII in the vision granted to him in 1884.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">While St. </span>
<span style="font-family:
   Arial">Paul</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> tells us to “despise not 
prophecy” (that is, true prophecy from Scripture or from holy persons or saints 
deemed credible by Holy, Mother </span><span style="font-family:
  Arial">Church</span><span style="font-family:
Arial">), we must also be cautious in the application of prophecy. It is 
entirely possible that the thesis I have put forth in this paper is entirely

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">

become obvious exactly how a prophecy is fulfilled, until after it happens!” 
Wise words, these. Earlier in this paper we covered that private prophecies are 
never binding on our Faith, but that we may wish to pay heed when a recurring 
prophecy is found as coming from credible persons, Popes, or saints, especially 
if the same theme is found from many persons, from many centuries, and from many countries.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">For further research, a good summary of the 
Church’s view on how to view private prophecy was carried in the introduction to 
“Catholic Prophecy” by Yves Dupont.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">One of the problems with the Pope Leo vision of 
1884 is that it has been difficult to find sources in approved books which were 
written by Catholic Clergy. (Again, what we have found is in Appendix II.) Therefore, I am deeply grateful to a kind email 
correspondent who read some of this analysis and sent me the following passage 
from a book entitled, “Begone Satan&quot;, by Fr. Carl Vogl, written in 1935. This 
correspondent was quick to point out that even the time frame of 100 years 
(sometimes said to be 75 to 100 years) may not be an essential part of Pope 
Leo’s actual vision. While I don’t lean to this conclusion, it is a point worth 
noting. Here is the passage sent to me:<br>
<br>
&quot;After celebrating Mass one day, [Pope Leo] was in conference with the 
Cardinals. Suddenly he sank to the floor. A doctor was summoned and several came 
at once. There was no sign of any pulse-beating, the life seemed to have ebbed 
away from the already weakened and aged body. Suddenly he recovered and said: 
'What a horrible picture I was permitted to see!' He saw what was going to 
happen in the future, the misleading powers and the ravings of the devils 
against the Church. But St. </span><span style="font-family:
 Arial">Michael</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> had appeared in the nick 
of time and cast Satan into the abyss of Hell. Such was the occasion that caused 
Pope Leo XIII to have this prayer recited over the entire world at the end of 
the Mass,&quot; (<u>Begone Satan</u>, by Rev. Carl Vogl, 1935; an account of the 
exorcism undertaken in Earling, Iowa). <br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">This correspondent also wrote the following in 
the same email:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
”Vogl recounts in his book that Anna Catherine Emmerich is the one who said that 
50 or 60 years before the year 2,000 A.D., &quot;Lucifer would again be freed for a 
time.&quot; A possessed woman prophesied that after the year 2,000, not much time 
would be left . . .” End of quote.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">In any case, this paper was written in this 
spirit, as expressed by Yves Dupont in his introduction to “Catholic Prophecy”: 
“Indeed, prophecies are for our edification. They cast a light on many problems; 
they warn us against errors; they prepare us for dangers to come; and they are a 
manifestation of the power of God. At the same time, they are an encouragement 
and a consolation. The current crisis in the Church and in the world was 
predicted long ago, but the final victory of the Christian forces is also 
predicted; this is an encouragement and a consolation.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">So, please, keep all these principles and 
cautions in mind as the history of our time unfolds. To quote St. </span>
<span style="font-family:
   Arial">Paul</span><span style="font-family:Arial">, again, this time in full, 
“&quot;Despise not prophecies, but prove all things; hold fast to that which is 
good.&quot; (1 Thess. 5:20-21)</span></p>

<span style="font-family:Arial">CONCLUSION:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Circa 1981, Sister Monica Foltzer, the phonics 
nun (author of &quot;Professor Phonics Gives Sound Advice), met with a group of young 
interested people, whom I had helped to assemble, to discuss the times we were 
going through. The next day, Sister gave me a call was somewhat urgent that I 
call those who had attended and give them this message which she wanted them to 
hear: &quot;Live your spiritual life as if the world is going to end tomorrow; live 
your physical life as if the world is going to go on forever.&quot; Sister was 
concerned that going over the progress the forces of evil were making, and 
talking about a possible coming chastisement, would cause the young people to 
feel that they need not be so concerned with their careers, education, etc. This 
would, of course, be a totally wrong attitude.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">As always, each of us should work and pray according to 
our station in life. Each of us should strive to stay in the state of sanctifying grace. Wear the 
brown scapular. Do penance and pray the Rosary daily, as requested specifically by Our 
Lady of Fatima.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Almost everyone who might read this has probably 
had a pretty rough go, in one way or another, in recent years and decades. Fr. James Dunphy, the great 
priest from the midwest who in our time has spent the latter part of his life 
saying Mass, praying, and counseling troubled people and families, once stated 
that in the modern world (in the developed nations) we find that our 
circumstances have, in effect, traded the physical hardship of generations past 
-&nbsp; 
for mental hardship.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Many people, who have remained faithful to their 
Catholic Faith, nevertheless seem to have fallen into a kind of fatalism, or 
even despair. It was to help correct this attitude, or perhaps, in some 
instances, to try and prevent it, that this pamphlet was written. One valiant lady said to me about a year ago: 
“What is needed most in our time is HOPE.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
<span style="font-family:Arial">Now, if the analysis in this paper regarding the 
current crisis of Church and state is true, -- and if we are indeed at least 
trying to be counted amongst those “faithful few” who “wait in sorrow for the 
Church’s Resurrection”, then let us quit acting like we are on the side that is 
going to perpetually lose, and begin to prepare for when the triumph of the 
Church and of the Immaculate Heart of Mary</span><span style="font-family:

<span style="font-family:Arial">There is one account which I have read on the 
internet which claims that Pope Leo XIII had his 1884 vision precisely on the 
date of October 13 – exactly 33 years before the date of the Miracle of the Sun 
at Fatima, which took place on October 13, 1917. If this be true, it is an 
astounding fact, indicating a very special relationship between Pope Leo’s 
vision and Fatima. However, I could not find any other confirmation of this 
anywhere, nor did the website on which I found it appear to carry the 
credibility that one would want to rely upon. If anybody could confirm or deny 
this, I would greatly appreciate it if they could contact me at: </span>

possible without the painstaking work of Yves Dupont, author of <i>Catholic 
Prophecy</i>, and </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Gary Giuffre, whose 
unique research on the crisis in the Catholic Church since 1958 brought the 
meaning of many of the prophecies in Dupont’s book into clear focus as the 
1970s, 1980s, and 1990s progressed. Also, this pamphlet is built on many pieces 
of research outside of Dupont’s book which Mr. Giuffre pointed out to me over 
the years. In addition, Dupont’s book would never have seen the light of day 
without the efforts and vision of Mr. Thomas Nelson of TAN books. Finally, the 
seed which grew into this pamphlet was planted when Mr. Christopher Schaper, a 
dedicated Catholic father, business man, and activist, informed me several years ago about an 
article in <i>Catholic Family News</i> which suggested that the time of Satan’s 
increased power did not begin in 1884, the year in which Pope Leo XIII had his 
extraordinary vision, -- but that the 100 years of Satan’s increased power quite 
likely began at a later date. </span></p>

bloody persecution of the Church and sanctioned the public ministry of the

<span style="font-family: Arial"><b>Third Period:</b>

St. Sylvester to Pope Leo III</span>: In the year 800 A.D., on Christmas Day, in 
a solemn ceremony, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne the Emperor of all the 
Christian nations of Europe. From the time of Constantine to the time of 
Charlemagne, enough nations of the known world had been converted to 
Christianity that the leaders of these Christian nations recognized Charlemagne 
as the Emperor of all of Christendom due to his crowning by Leo III.</span></p>

which is still continuing today in 2007. The prophecies agree that the end of 
this Fifth Period of the Church will be marked by a disintegration of both 
Church and state, leading up to the Great Chastisement. </span></p>

three generations. Fr. Sylvester Berry, who wrote circa 1921, maintains that 
this period will last for around 500 years, to repair and rebuild after the 500

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 200; margin-right: 200">
Many people will remember that, before the reforms of the Second Vatican 
Council, at the end of every Mass the celebrant and the faithful knelt to recite 
a prayer to Mary and one to Michael the Archangel. This is a very beautiful 
prayer and brings great benefits to all those who pray it. <font color="#800000">
<i>(This writer's note: three Hail Marys and the St. Michael's Prayer were said 
at the end of low Masses up until 1962, when this practice was 
abruptly ended without explanation by John XXIII.)</i></font><br>
<br>
<i>Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protection against 
the [malice] and snares of the devil; may God rebuke him, we humbly pray; and do 
thou, O Prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God, [cast] into hell Satan 
and all the evil spirits who wander through the world [seeking] the ruin of 
souls. Amen. <br>

What are the origins of this prayer? Here is what the magazine <i>Ephemerides 
Liturgicae</i> reported in 1995 on pages 58-59:<br>

&quot;I do not remember the exact year. One morning the great Pope Leo XIII had 
celebrated a Mass and, as usual, was attending a Mass of thanksgiving. Suddenly, 
we saw him raise his head and stare at something above the celebrant's head. He 
was staring motionlessly, without batting an eye. His expression was one of 
horror and awe; the color and look on his face changing rapidly. Something 
unusual and grave was happening in him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Finally, as though coming to his senses, he lightly but firmly tapped his hand 
and rose to his feet. He headed for his private office. His retinue followed 
anxiously and solicitously, whispering: 'Holy Father, are you not feeling well? 
Do you need anything?' He answered: 'Nothing, nothing.' About half an hour 
later, he called for the Secretary of the Congregation of Rites and, handing him 
a sheet of paper, requested that it be printed and sent to all the ordinaries 
around the world. What was that paper? It was the prayer that we recite with the 
people at the end of every Mass. It is the plea to Mary and the passionate 
request to the Prince of the heavenly host, beseeching God to send Satan back to 
hell.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pope Leo XIII instructed [the priest and the faithful] to kneel during those 
prayers. What we just reported was published in the newspaper <i>La settimana 
Del Clero</i>, March 30, 1947, but it does not give the source of the 
information.</p>

<font color="#800000">(This writer's note: While this version would have to 
carry decisive weight if completely accurate, there are several things in it 
which would indicate further research is needed. While Fr. Amorth and other 
websites say that the journal Ephemerides Liturgicae published this account of 
Fr. Pechenino's in 1995, the author of the article on Wikipedia states that the 
year was actually 1955, and gives more accurate footnoting, namely, (V. LXIX, 
pages 54-60) -- so this is one legitimate question. Next, the quote from Fr. 
Pechenino says &quot;at the end of every Mass&quot;, when it  would have been well 
known to any and all priests of that era that this prayer was only recited after 
low masses. Also, there is no mention anywhere of Mary in the prayer to St. 
Michael recited after low masses. However, Mary is mentioned near the ended of 
the longer St. Michael's prayer in the Raccolta. On the website </font>
<a href="http://www.traditioninaction.com"><font color="#800000">
www.traditioninaction.com</font></a><font color="#800000">, they carry a version 
of the longer prayer which appeared in the Raccolta of 1898. With these few 
mistakes in the above passage attributed to Fr. Pechenino, my question would be 
whether Fr. Pechenino was actually an eye-witness to this event, or whether that 
also became garbled as the above passage was handed down. The much more common 
oral tradition is what we have carried at the beginning of this pamphlet, and 
what is carried in Fr. Carl Vogl's book, &quot;Begone Satan&quot;, quoted near the end of 
the body of the essay. A very 
similar but slightly different version is summarized on the Tradition in Action 
website as follows: &quot;One day, after celebrating Mass, the aged Pope Leo XIII was 
in conference with the Cardinals when suddenly he sank to the floor in a deep 
swoon. Physicians who hastened to his side could find no trace of his pulse and 
feared that he had expired. However, after a short interval the Holy Father 
regained consciousness and exclaimed with great emotion: &quot;Oh, what a horrible 
picture I have been permitted to see!&quot; He had been shown a vision of evil 
spirits who had been released from Hell and their efforts to destroy the Church. 
But in the midst of the horror the Archangel St. Michael appeared and cast Satan 
and his legions into the abyss of hell.&quot;)  </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 250; margin-right: 250">
However, we were able to verify that the prayer was indeed sent to the 
ordinaries in 1886, under unusual circumstances. A reliable witness, Cardinal Nasalli Rocca, in his 1946 Lenten Pastoral Letter to the Diocese of Bologna, 
wrote: &quot;Leo XIII himself wrote that prayer. The sentence 'The evil spirits who 
wander through the world for the ruin of souls' has an historical explanation 
that was many times repeated by his private secretary, Monsignor Rinaldo Angeli. 
Leo XIII truly saw, in a vision, demonic spirits who were congregating in the 
Eternal City (Rome). The prayer that he asked all the Church to recite was the 
fruit of that experience. He would recite that prayer with strong, powerful 
voice: we heard it many a time in the Vatican Basilica. Leo XIII also personally 
wrote an exorcism that is included in the Roman Ritual (1954 edition, XII, C. 
Ill, p. 863 and following). He recommended that bishops and priests read these 
exorcisms often in their dioceses and parishes. He himself would recite them 
often throughout the day.&quot; (Note: Paul VI, in direct contradiction of the 
acts and attitude of Pope Leo XIII and all the true Popes for 2000 years, 
suppressed the order of exorcism for new priests circa 1968. Now, are we 
supposed to believe that such a change came from Heaven, or from the pit of 
Hell? Are we supposed to believe that such a change came from a true Pope, or 
from an anti-pope?)<br>
<br>
Another interesting factor attests to the value of the prayers that we used to 
recite after every low Mass. Pius XI added a particular intention for the conversion 
of Russia (allocution of June 30, 1930). In this allocution, after reminding all 
to pray for Russia, and of the religious persecution in Russia, he closed with 
the following sentence: &quot;Let us proclaim the prayers that our great predecessor, 
Leo XIII, directed all priests and the faithful to pray at the end of the Mass, 
for the particular intention of the conversion of Russia. Let all bishops and 
clergy so inform everyone who is present at the Holy Sacrifice, and remind them 
often.&quot; (Civiltà Cattolica, 1930, vol. 3.)<br>

<font color="#800000">(This writer's note: after seeing this strong testimony 
and endorsement of Pope Pius XI regarding the exorcism prayer of Pope Leo XIII, 
I wish to emphasize again that, in the very year of 1962 when the Soviet Union 
and the United States came to the brink of a nuclear exchange, John XIII, who 
emerged from the conclave of 1958 -- two days after the white smoke confusion of 
October 26, 1958, -- discontinued the use of these prayers after 
low mass for the conversion of Russia throughout the world -- without 
explanation. Researcher Gary Giuffre has related to me that as a 13 year old 
server, he had asked the priest after the first Sunday Mass at which these 
prayers were omitted: &quot;Father, did Russia convert last week?&quot; To which his 
parish priest replied genially: &quot;I just do what they tell me.&quot;)</font></p>
