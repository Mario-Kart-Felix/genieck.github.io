It was an <em>exercise in resistance</em>.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;No thanks!&rdquo; you&rsquo;d say. &ldquo;I have homework to go do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d retort. Impressed with your delivery, he&rsquo;d decided to step up the simulated <em>peer pressure</em>. &ldquo;I thought you were cool.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Not doing drugs <em>is</em> cool,&rdquo; was your reply.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your classmates might have applauded, at the officer/teacher&rsquo;s prompting. Then you went back to your seat, and the officer would go over the things you did well in the exercise, so the class could learn by your example. In addition to teaching the other students, the officer was also building up your <em>self esteem</em>.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Self esteem and resistance were two major cornerstones of the Drug Abuse Resistance Education Program, also known as DARE. Through the 1980s and the 1990s, DARE swelled from a tiny local program to a massive, and massively expensive, national campaign against drugs in schools. At its peak, DARE was practiced in <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-new-d-a-r-e-program-this-one-works/"><span class="s2">75% of American schools</span></a>, and cost hundreds of millions of dollars to run. It had spiffy, 90s branded swag, and a baritone-voiced mascot, &ldquo;Daren the Lion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was just one problem: DARE didn&rsquo;t work.</span></p><p class="p4"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79dM70qJfWU"><span class="s3"><img class="cms-img" src="https://pix-media.priceonomics-media.com/blog/1037/image06.png" /></span></a></p><p class="p1">Students who went through DARE weren&rsquo;t any less likely to do drugs than the students who didn&rsquo;t. In fact, there&rsquo;s some well-regarded research that some groups of students were actually <em>more</em> likely to do drugs if they went through DARE.</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Scientists knew DARE was ineffective relatively early on, but the program grew anyways. The program&rsquo;s eventual reform was the result of a long and hard battle between evidence-based research, and popular opinion.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>DARE&rsquo;s Humble Beginnings</strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="cms-img" src="https://pix-media.priceonomics-media.com/blog/1037/image10.jpg" /></span></p><blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>The original &ldquo;Officer DARE&rdquo;: DARE&rsquo;s founder,</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Gates#/media/File:DarylGatescolorportrait.jpg"><span class="s2"><em> LAPD Chief Daryl Gates</em></span></a><em>, later became infamous for his handling of the Rodney King Riots</em></span></p></blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1">DARE got its beginnings in the city of Los Angeles in the early 1980s. Daryl Gates, the LA Police Department (LAPD) Chief of Police, helped create the program, and became its first figurehead. The story goes that when Gates noticed that the number of drug busts on school campuses was increasing, he had the idea to focus on preventative education instead of punishment. As Gates told the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-09/news/mn-33226_1_anti-drug-program"><span class="s2"><em>L.A. Times</em></span></a> in 1993:</span></p><blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>"We had 'buy programs' in the schools where undercover officers would buy drugs from students. We kept buying more and more. It was appalling, depressing. I finally said: 'This is crazy. We've got to do something.' "</em></span></p></blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The LAPD, in conjunction with the local rotary club and the LA Unified School District (LAUSD), came up with the Drug Abuse Resistance Education Program, DARE (also, incidentally, a pun with Chief Daryl Gates&rsquo; first name.)</span></p><div id="top-ad" class="article-ad"><script async="async" src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- Top Rectangle 25% --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:336px;height:280px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1943095553698263" data-ad-slot="9485818888"></ins><script>
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script></div><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dr. Ruth Rich, the district&rsquo;s health education specialist, was tasked with selecting the first curriculum. Research on drug prevention education was already underway at USC, under the title &ldquo;SMART.&rdquo; But there was a catch -- Gates wanted DARE to be taught by police officers themselves, not doctors or teachers. Rich agreed with him, on the grounds that cops are more familiar with criminal culture. <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-09/news/mn-33226_1_anti-drug-program"><span class="s2">As she told the <em>LA Times</em></span></a>, "There&rsquo;s a gap between the street and the classroom. Police officers are believable on this subject. When it comes to drugs, they're more credible than a teacher."</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of police officers in the classroom turned off some of SMART&rsquo;s original authors, including the head of the research team, Andy Johnson. <a href="https://reason.com/archives/1995/03/01/drug-prevention-placebo"><span class="s2"><em>Reason Magazine</em></span></a> reported, &ldquo;Though sympathetic to Rich's dilemma, Johnson had serious objections to handing an experimental educational program over to the local police.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Without Johnson&rsquo;s oversight, Rich took the SMART curriculum and patterned her own off of it. In 1993, there were two main versions of SMART: one that focused on developing personal goals and self esteem, and another that focused on resisting things like peer pressure and advertisements. Rich combined the two approaches.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="cms-img" src="https://pix-media.priceonomics-media.com/blog/1037/image05.jpg" /></span></p><blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>A DARE course taught by </em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US_Navy_031021-N-6362C-001_Master_at_Arms_2nd_Class_Aaron_M._Hendrickson,_Naples_area_Drug_Abuse_Resistance_Education_(DARE)_officer,_follows_along_with_Justin_Goldacker_as_they_work_to_complete_a_lesson_in_the_DARE_workbook.jpg"><span class="s2"><em>Naval officers</em></span></a></span></p></blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the school opened in September 1983, the LAPD took to the classroom to both teach kids about the dangers of substance abuse, boost their self-esteem, and help them practice &ldquo;just saying no&rdquo; (a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Say_No"><span class="s2">Nancy Reagan</span></a>). Within a few years, DARE was a regular fixture in LA schools. By the mid-nineties, it was a national organization with multi-million dollar annual revenue.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The program was popular among parents and students from its inception. It was also popular among politicians and bureaucrats, who saw DARE as a way to be proactive about, &ldquo;The Drug Problem.&rdquo; From the <a href="https://reason.com/archives/1995/03/01/drug-prevention-placebo"><span class="s2"><em>Reason Magazine</em></span></a>:</span></p><blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>"[People were] eager to find an easy solution to the problem of juvenile drug abuse. DARE became 'a rallying symbol to do something positive about the drug abuse problem.'"</em></span></p></blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This political status carried DARE far. In 1986, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) published the first <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1999-03346-017"><span class="s2">independent review of DARE</span></a>, reporting that the program had short-term results. Although it drew criticism from the scientific community, DARE earned NIJ funding as a result of the study. DARE also soon won a $140,000 grant from the Department of Justice to expand the program to the national level. And Congress passed the &ldquo;Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986,&rdquo; which set aside 10% of State Grants to Governors for police-staffed, in-school, drug education programs, and mentions DARE by name.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like that, DARE became a national, nationally funded movement. In 1988, U.S. presidents started recognizing National DARE Day, a practice that continued into the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/06/presidential-proclamation-national-dare-day"><span class="s2">Obama administration</span></a>. By 1992, the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act money accounted for almost <a href="http://www.monitor.net/monitor/12-3-95/dare.html"><span class="s2">$10 million nationally</span></a>. By 1995, DARE estimated its own costs at <a href="https://reason.com/archives/1995/03/01/drug-prevention-placebo"><span class="s2">$200 million</span></a>.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>DARE vs. The Research, I</strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="cms-img" src="https://pix-media.priceonomics-media.com/blog/1037/image07.jpg" /></span></p><blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>This pencil thing </em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/12/nyregion/slogan-causes-pencil-recall.html"><span class="s2"><em>actually happened.</em></span></a></span></p></blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1">That first independent review of DARE, which found that it had an effect on drug use, quickly started to look like an extreme anomaly. By 1991 there were already more than a dozen published studies claiming that DARE had absolutely no measurable effect on drug use. This negative finding proceeded to bear out through another two decades of research.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This came as no surprise to the social scientists behind DARE&rsquo;s original curriculum, the SMART program. A few years after DARE started, the USC researchers made an alarming discovery about SMART: early versions of the program didn&rsquo;t work. In fact, some of them had a &ldquo;boomerang effect,&rdquo; by which participation correlated to <em>higher</em> rates of drug use. But by the time of this discovery, the LAUSD had grown &ldquo;distant&rdquo;, according to SMART researcher, <a href="http://www.monitor.net/monitor/12-3-95/dare.html"><span class="s2">Bill Hansen</span></a>. Hansen and Johnson claim they reached out to DARE to help revise the curriculum, but were rejected.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;What they took was the prototype,&rdquo; Hansen <a href="http://www.monitor.net/monitor/12-3-95/dare.html"><span class="s2">has said</span></a>, &ldquo;we went through thirty versions of the curriculum, so a lot of the stuff they lifted was antiquated, in our view.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem was that, to a lot of people, it seemed like common sense that DARE would just <em>work</em>. &ldquo;Everyone believed that if you just told students how harmful these substances and behaviors were&mdash;they'd stay away from them," <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-new-d-a-r-e-program-this-one-works/"><span class="s2">Frank Pegueros</span></a>, the current president and CEO of DARE. America, has said.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This deep-seated, folksy belief in DARE&rsquo;s ability to combat a publicly reviled problem gave it a decades-long stranglehold on the American education system. ''We suspect that there are gaping holes in the program and that it may not be cost-effective, but legislators are politicians,'' a legislator told the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/01/nyregion/dare-program-sacred-cow-or-fatted-calf.html?_r=0"><span class="s2"><em>New York Times </em>in 2004</span></a>, on the condition that his name not be used. ''No one's going to risk their political future by doing anything other than standing up with the parents. Parents vote.''</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="cms-img" src="https://pix-media.priceonomics-media.com/blog/1037/image04.jpg" /></span></p><blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Drug use in high schools went down nationally in the 1980s and early 1990s. Some people who observed this trend in their local community might have misattributed it to DARE. (Via </em><a href="http://www.krusekronicle.com/kruse_kronicle/social_indicators_series/#.VgrYJyBViko"><span class="s2"><em>KruseKronicle</em></span></a><em>)</em></span></p></blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of the battle between DARE and its scientific critics played out in public. Research was met with anecdotes, or with pleas that the program was changing too fast for studies of old curricula to be relevant, or that DARE was so widespread, its effects so particular, that it couldn&rsquo;t be tested. "I don't have any statistics for you. Our strongest numbers are the numbers that don't show up,&rdquo; a DARE official <a href="https://reason.com/archives/2001/01/01/dare-aware"><span class="s2">once told a newspaper</span></a>. DARE supporters would regularly accuse critics of being in bed with drug cartels, or selfishly interested in taking over the drug resistance education industry. Negative media would inspire letters to the editor, supporting the program and calling for more funding.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">DARE executives often pointed to the program&rsquo;s popularity as evidence of its credibility. As Glenn Levant, the former LAPD officer who directed DARE in the early 1990s, told the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-09/news/mn-33226_1_anti-drug-program/2"><span class="s2"><em>LA Times</em></span></a> in 1993, "Knocking DARE is like kicking your mother or saying that apple pie doesn't taste good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">He went on, &ldquo;For 10 years, I've been living and breathing DARE, and it's all been about helping kids. That's our program, and that's what we're going to keep on doing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>DARE vs. The Research, II</strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="cms-img" src="https://pix-media.priceonomics-media.com/blog/1037/image00.png" /></span></p><blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>The NIJ commissioned a study from the prestigious </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTI_International#/media/File:Rti-logo.png"><span class="s2"><em>Research Triangle Institute</em></span></a><em>, and then refused to publish it</em></span></p></blockquote><div id="middle-ad" class="article-ad"><script async="async" src="//"></script><!-- Middle of Article 2016 --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:336px;height:280px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1943095553698263" data-ad-slot="2240034081"></ins><script>

  </script></div><p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was also a behind-the-scenes battle that played out between DARE and scientific research. While DARE was doing its best to publicly combat and distract the scientific naysayers, they also tried to silence critics before they reached the public spotlight at all.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the early 90s, the NIJ hired the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to do a meta-analysis of the existing evaluations of DARE&rsquo;s efficacy. In 1994, RTI concluded the study, announcing that DARE had no measurable effect on drug use, <em>and</em> that other, existing programs, seem to do better. DARE could be improved, and if it refused to improve, it could be replaced. From <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1615171/pdf/amjph00460-0036.pdf"><span class="s2">the study&rsquo;s conclusion</span></a>:</span></p><blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>"DARE&rsquo;s limited influence on adolescent drug use behavior contrasts with the program&rsquo;s popularity and prevalence. An important implication is that DARE could be taking the place of other, more beneficial drug use curricula that adolescents could be receiving."</em></span></p></blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, despite positive peer review, and despite the fact that the NIJ had closely reviewed the study throughout its development, the NIJ refused to publish the results. They did not elaborate on their refusal, beyond claiming the work did not meet their, &ldquo;high standards of methodological rigor.&rdquo; The NIJ then issued a press release, reporting on the unpublished study, including the positive findings that DARE is popular, and growing, and omitting the claims of ineffectiveness.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Not only is DARE widespread and popular, but demand for it is high," it read. "[DARE&rsquo;s] appeal cuts across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines [with] considerable support for expansion of the program."</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="cms-img" src="https://pix-media.priceonomics-media.com/blog/1037/image08.jpg" /></span></p><blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>A DARE class in 2005 -- 11 years after the RTI paper was published (</em><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ooocha/3051561996/in/photolist-dtZF7K-gDXteS-5wvLey-6qHdH1-M1MgW-6jFsyT-56Ks5W-azvG4R-56Fhyz-7XRYkQ-7iu7Se-5EoEjD-azvGjv-azymnN-azvGmp-azvGb4-azvGdR-azvFW4-azym2A-azvGoD-azym4Y-azymbY-bvsoxi-eHwMHV-bvxJHu-jR9gc-hyooP-vBPMm-6HQTTc-9APKSU-g3t14e-uaBz7X-fdtV6-5DE44S-a8CCkQ-8af8oW-6YwEJa-pt2v6x-57wHY7-cVu3o1-dLA49i-dVd8Bg-u6WHxv-6tM95t"><span class="s2"><em>Marion Doss</em></span></a><em>)</em></span></p></blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1">When RTI sought publication in an independent journal -- the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em> -- DARE pressured the journal against publishing. The<em> Journal&rsquo;s</em> editor, Sabine Beisler, told <em>USA Today, </em>"DARE has tried to interfere with the publication of this. They tried to intimidate us." The paper, which flew through peer review, was published anyways.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The paper&rsquo;s lead author commented on the fact that the concerns over methodological rigor were particularly problematic because the paper was a meta-analysis of <em>existing research</em>. RTI did not conduct any new experiments. As they told <a href="https://reason.com/archives/1995/03/01/drug-prevention-placebo"><span class="s2"><em>Reason</em></span></a><em>:</em></span></p><blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>"The results of all the studies used in the meta-analysis were consistent; it's not like the conclusions of these different studies were all over the place. We did not find any support for [a statistically significant] impact on drug use, and they show DARE has no effect at all on marijuana use."</em></span></p></blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1">When asked how the NIJ reviewers refused an article that the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em> reviewers &ldquo;uniformly appraised&rdquo; as &ldquo;first-rate,&rdquo; a DARE spokesperson told <em>Reason, </em>"It was hot and sexy for Public Health to criticize DARE."</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Makin&rsquo; it REAL</strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hot and sexy or not, the RTI study was by no means the last to find DARE completely ineffective. No matter how researchers sliced it -- by observing students exposed to more up-to-date versions of the curriculum, or who had taken DARE for multiple years -- they could not find any evidence that DARE reduced drug use. There was some evidence that it temporarily improved students&rsquo; self-esteem, or gave them negative attitudes towards drugs. But there wasn&rsquo;t <em>any</em> evidence that it actually had an effect on the behavior it was supposed to target.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">But these reports themselves seemed ineffective at reaching the public in a meaningful way. Nor were they effective at slowing DARE&rsquo;s growth. Then, nearly 20 years after DARE launched with a faulty curriculum, things started to change.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2000, the Department of Education did an audit of drug education programs. Only evidenced-based programs would be eligible for funding out of the Department of Education&rsquo;s drug education budget. <a href="https://reason.com/archives/2004/01/01/just-say-no-again"><span class="s2">DARE did not make the cut</span></a>.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2001, the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dope/dare/truth.html"><span class="s2">Surgeon General did its own evaluation</span></a>, concluding, "[D.A.R.E.'s] popularity persists despite numerous well-designed evaluations and meta-analyses that consistently show little or no deterrent effects on substance use."</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="cms-img" src="https://pix-media.priceonomics-media.com/blog/1037/image01.png" /></span></p><blockquote><p class="p4"><span class="s4"><em>The flag of the </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office"><span class="s5"><em>Government Accountability Office</em></span></a></span></p></blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, in 2003, another government organization evaluated DARE. This time, it was the Government Accountability Office (GAO) -- a federal watchdog on government spending of taxpayer money. GAO&rsquo;s interest in DARE was obvious. DARE was funded with federal, state, and local taxes. In 2003, DARE&rsquo;s cost was estimated at between $200 million and $2 billion.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">GAO selected six long-term evaluations for review -- studies that looked at kids 5 to 10 years after the DARE program and evaluated its effect. All of the studies found &ldquo;no significant differences in illicit drug use,&rdquo; between the DARE group and the control group. Five of the six reported on students attitudes towards drugs and found, &ldquo;no significant differences between the [DARE] and control groups over the long term.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although GAO left the detail out of its report, some of the research it included in its review found that DARE had the dreaded &ldquo;boomerang&rdquo; effect on some students. As the authors of the original paper wrote, &ldquo;Suburban students who were D.A.R.E. graduates scored higher than suburban students in the Control group on all four major drug use measures.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="cms-img" src="https://pix-media.priceonomics-media.com/blog/1037/image09.jpg" /></span></p><blockquote><p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rocky_Anderson_at_MLK.jpg"><em>Rocky Anderson</em></a></span></p></blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The DARE money finally started to ebb. Cities and districts started shutting down their DARE programs -- Rocky Anderson, as mayor of Salt Lake City, famously called the program a <a href="https://reason.com/archives/2001/01/01/dare-aware"><span class="s2">&ldquo;fraud on the people of America.&rdquo;</span></a> Threatened with extinction, the shrinking DARE <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dope/dare/"><span class="s2">got serious</span></a> about reforming itself into an evidenced-based practice. Suddenly, they needed and wanted the scientific community&rsquo;s help.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;It was state of the art when we launched it,&rdquo; Levant said in 2001, when he announced the planned curriculum overhaul. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s time for science to improve upon what we&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might have been too little, too late. By 2010, DARE&rsquo;s revenue was <a href="https://reason.com/blog/2012/12/03/dare-americas-most-famous-anti-drug-prog"><span class="s2">$3.7 million</span></a>, down from $10 million in 2002.

The replacement program, titled &ldquo;keepin&rsquo; it REAL,&rdquo; launched in 2011. Its developers say it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-new-d-a-r-e-program-this-one-works/"><span class="s2">&ldquo;not an anti-drug program,&rdquo;</span></a> but is more centered on decision-making skills, <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-new-d-a-r-e-program-this-one-works/"><span class="s2">&ldquo;things like being honest and safe and responsible.&rdquo;</span></a> But, unlike DARE, it&rsquo;s been demonstrated in a handful of studies <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-new-d-a-r-e-program-this-one-works/"><span class="s2">to reduce the risk of drug abuse</span></a>:</span></p><blockquote><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>&ldquo;The reports from students who completed keepin&rsquo; it REAL indicated that they sampled these substances less than those in a control group, and used a wider variety of strategies to stay sober. Their antidrug attitudes were also more likely to stick over time.&rdquo;</em></span></p></blockquote><p class="p6"><span class="s1">After two and a half decades of research, and the threat of extinction by defunding, DARE is finally friends with science.
