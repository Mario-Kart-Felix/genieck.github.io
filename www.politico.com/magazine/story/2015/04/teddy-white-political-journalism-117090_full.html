<p align="left">William F. Buckley once declared that White &ldquo;revolutionized the art of political reporting.&rdquo;</p> <p align="left">The conventional wisdom of 1960 held that a candidate&rsquo;s campaign began when he announced he was running and that reporters should follow him from stop to stop, dutifully recording all that was said and how the crowds responded. Instead, White covered campaigns with a novelist&rsquo;s eye, writing about what candidates ate and drank (&ldquo;his first drink of the day, a Daiquiri&rdquo;), the smell in the rooms they occupied (&ldquo;The hall stank of sweat and stale tobacco&rdquo;), even the amount of shine on their footwear (&ldquo;of his two shoes, one was glossily polished as usual&mdash;the other scuffed and dirty&rdquo;). He covered the inside-campaign dynamics: the strategy meetings, the internal polling, the publicity and marketing efforts. He recorded body language, the weather, the shifting moods of the candidates&mdash;and also of their aides, wives and families. He added sociological insight: Hyannis Port was not just the location of the Kennedy family compound but a place &ldquo;molded in the best and simplest of the old New England manner, its homes less ostentatious and snugger in style than the summer homes of the Long Island Hamptons.&rdquo; The Kennedys, White noted, had been &ldquo;the first of the Irish to invade its quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="widgetMagazineGlobalSponsoredContent" class="p3Global">

<p align="left">&ldquo;I read parts of it every four years,&rdquo; says Dan Balz, a longtime political reporter for the <em>Washington Post</em> who wrote books about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Battle-America-Extraordinary-Election/dp/014311770X">2008</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Collision-2012-Romney-Elections-America/dp/0670025941">2012</a> campaigns. &ldquo;I constantly go back to it&mdash;both to remind myself of the ambition of that book and also because it&rsquo;s just a pleasure to read.&rdquo; After <em>The Making of the President 1960</em>, news editors would routinely warn their reporters not to get beaten by White in a book appearing months after the election was over. It was the book that, to a large extent, created the drive for the &ldquo;scooplet,&rdquo; the attention to the small scene details that has transformed workaday trail reporting into dramatic narrative writing.</p> <p align="left">While he was writing <em>The Making of the President 1960</em>, however, White wasn&rsquo;t sure anyone would want to read a book about a long-finished campaign&mdash;and much of it about the guy who lost. A genre that is so much in demand today, one that often makes the <em>New York Times</em> best-seller lists and spawns <a href="http://www.hbo.com/movies/game-change#/">HBO movies</a> starring Julianne Moore and Ed Harris, seemed far from a sure thing. And White didn&rsquo;t seem like a journalist ready to transform presidential politics. He had spent his early professional life reporting in China during World War II and in Europe chronicling the Marshall Plan. Then he had taken up writing fiction.</p>

<p align="left">In the fall of 1959, White&mdash;who was then 44 years old and would have celebrated his 100th birthday this May&mdash;had just completed his latest novel, landing in the same doldrums he had occupied after finishing his three previous books. He was exhausted and lethargic, crashing every night at 9 or 10 o&rsquo;clock, waking up more tired than when he went to bed.</p> <p align="left">He was already a best-selling author, and Columbia Pictures had recently wrapped up production on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054095/"><em>The Mountain Road</em></a>, a war film starring Jimmy Stewart based on White&rsquo;s novel of the same name. His publisher, William Sloane Associates, had high hopes for his next novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/View-Fortieth-Floor-Theodore-White/dp/B000GQVEZ8"><em>The View from the Fortieth Floor</em></a>, a roman &agrave; clef about the demise of <em>Collier&rsquo;s</em> magazine. Hollywood superagent Irving Lazar was eagerly shopping <em>Fortieth Floor </em>around to film producersWhite, though, was despondent. &ldquo;I would so like to write The Book &hellip; and am so unsure of myself that I&rsquo;ve spent the past two or three weeks stewing in total lack of resolution,&rdquo; he wrote to a friend in the fall of 1959. &ldquo;One thing only is certain: no more fiction for me for another three or four years. I simply have got to make contact with reality again.&rdquo;</p> <p align="left">He had two book ideas. One was to write about the nuclear-missile experts at MIT who were convinced that no one in the White House or the Kremlin truly understood the destructive power of atomic weapons. The other was to write about the 1960 presidential campaign, what he described at the time as &ldquo;a sort of modern history of the way Americans choose their sovereign.&rdquo;</p> <p align="left">The campaign idea was not one that many friends or publishers thought promising. Who would read an entire book about a presidential race that was already long over? The smart choice would have been to write about the MIT atomic scientists. It was the end of the Eisenhower administration, just two years after Sputnik, and the Cold War was approaching its nadir.</p>

<p align="left">When Gary Cooper bought the film rights to&nbsp;<em>Fortieth Floor</em>&nbsp;for $80,000&mdash;the equivalent of almost $650,000 today&mdash;Teddy and his wife, Nancy, met with friends to celebrate at the posh Quo Vadis restaurant in Manhattan. Over dinner, White expressed interest in writing the campaign book to his friend Theo Bennahum, who was a little drunk at the time. The Hollywood money gave him the breathing room necessary to tackle an uncertain project. Bennahum, though, &ldquo;denounced the very idea of the book and told me I was foolish to write it,&rdquo; White recalled later. Elections were not the stuff of grand theater.</p> <p align="center">***</p> <p align="left"><strong>From an early age,</strong>&nbsp;White had been both curious about the world and tenacious in exploring it. He grew up a poor Jewish kid in Boston and graduated from Harvard with a degree in Chinese history. His earliest childhood memory &ldquo;was of the sound of his mother crying late one night, crying to his father because there was no money to buy shoes for the children,&rdquo; he recalled in his memoir.</p>

<p align="left">In his early 20s, he became a foreign correspondent in China, most notably for&nbsp;<em>Time</em>, and covered wars, famine and the rise of communism from the late 1930s through the end of World War II. In 1945, he wrote&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thunder-Out-China-Theodore-White/dp/0306801280"><em>Thunder Out of China</em></a>, which sold 450,000 copies in hardcover, making it at that point the best-selling nonfiction book about China ever published in the United States. He was so overjoyed at the success of the book&mdash;and his newfound literary celebrity&mdash;that he flew his mother and sister in from Boston to see it in the windows of bookstores up and down Fifth Avenue. In 1948, he moved to Paris to cover the rebuilding of Europe for several publications, including the&nbsp;<em>New York Times Magazine</em>, and he wrote&nbsp;<em>Fire in the Ashes</em>, a book about Europe during the Marshall Plan.</p> <p align="left">Teddy and Nancy White moved back to New York in 1953 with two young children in tow, and Teddy worked a series of magazine stints. He was covering the 1956 Democratic convention in Chicago for&nbsp;<em>Collier&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;when his editor called to tell him that the&nbsp;<em>American</em>, a sister publication, was shutting down and&nbsp;<em>Collier&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;was in trouble. White abandoned writing a deeply reported article for&nbsp;<em>Collier&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;that he had already decided to call &ldquo;The Making of the President 1956&rdquo; in order to consult with the magazine&rsquo;s publishers about a rescue plan&mdash;making the magazine smaller and drastically reducing its expenses. The plan was ultimately unsuccessful.&nbsp;<em>Collier&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;closed soon after the 1956 election.</p> <p align="left">Out of a job, White did what many frustrated journalists before and since have done: He turned his life experiences into novels, writing&nbsp;<em>The Mountain Road</em>, based on his time in China, and then&nbsp;<em>The View from the Fortieth Floor</em>, about the implosion of two great magazines.</p> <p id='page_02'></p> <p align="left">But he was eager to return to reporting&mdash;&ldquo;to get back to the journalism of important things,&rdquo; as he wrote to a friend. The choice, in the end, was easy&mdash;despite the warnings of his friends and publisher, he had plenty of Hollywood money to take a gamble. &ldquo;The idea,&rdquo; he wrote later, &ldquo;was to follow a campaign from beginning to end. It would be written as a novel is written, with anticipated surprises as, one by one, early candidates vanish in the primaries until only two final jousters struggle for the prize in November. Moreover, it should be written as a story of a man in trouble, of the leader under the pressure of circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="left">At the time, no one had attempted such a project. &ldquo;I want to get at the real guts of the process of making an American president&mdash;what the mechanics, the mystique, the style, the pressures are with which an American who hopes to be our President must contend. The Presidency is, I think, the most noble office on earth&mdash;yet the Grand Process of choosing a Presidency has almost never been realistically analyzed,&rdquo; White wrote to Estes Kefauver, the Democratic senator from Tennessee who had secured the 1956 vice presidential nomination on the ticket with Adlai Stevenson only to be stomped in the general election.</p> <p align="left">In early 1960, White finagled press credentials from&nbsp;<em>Saturday Review</em>&nbsp;and flew to Madison, Wisconsin, to begin reporting. At the time, he had no book contract; his own publisher and others were lukewarm on the idea. From Wisconsin, he set off to follow several of the primary candidates&mdash;John F. Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Nelson Rockefeller among them&mdash;around the country. He raced from one campaign stop to another at, as he put it, &ldquo;a murderous clip.&rdquo; Through it all, he was plagued by his own uncertainty and by the bewilderment of campaign reporters for the wire services, the newsweeklies and the powerful regional newspapers who couldn&rsquo;t imagine what would be left to tell when the election was over.</p> <p align="left">As it turned out, he had plenty.</p> <p align="left">White pioneered a reporting tactic that would become the mainstay of scores of journalists who followed in his footsteps: insider access. Lots of access. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about Teddy White is that this was the early days of access journalism,&rdquo; says Evan Thomas, a former&nbsp;<em>Newsweek</em>&nbsp;editor and writer who has authored biographies of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Robert-Kennedy-Life-Evan-Thomas/dp/0743203291">Robert Kennedy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ikes-Bluff-President-Eisenhowers-Secret/dp/0316091030">Dwight Eisenhower</a>, as well as several campaign books. &ldquo;[White] is totally dependent on access, and he makes the most of it.&rdquo; During the Wisconsin primary, Kennedy revealed anxieties to White that no daily journalist knew about. The candidate was preoccupied with the idea that winning the most delegates would not be sufficient&mdash;that he might get railroaded by Democratic Party bosses who were accustomed to picking the nominee themselves. He worried, moreover, that they would prefer a Protestant. &ldquo;If they turn me down, the primary system is finished for good,&rdquo; Kennedy told White.</p> <p align="left">Months into covering the campaign, however, White still doubted whether he was getting anything worth writing about. His letters and recorded comments veered repeatedly between deep empathy for the politicians he covered and weary cynicism. &ldquo;Any week of interviewing politicians in Washington is like swimming upstream against a torrent of horseshit,&rdquo; he wrote to journalist and sometime Nixon operative James Bassett in November 1960.</p> <p align="left">Later, amid the grind of the campaign trail, a different state every day, White was somewhat delirious when he wrote a fever dream of a letter to Bennahum. White saw nothing on his horizon but airplanes and buses and drab hotel rooms. The letter is three pages long, single-spaced, elegant, philosophical, deeply cynical about the election and bordering on paranoid about the dishonesty of everything from the campaign to Wall Street to late-night TV. &ldquo;The scenery of politics is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous,&rdquo; White wrote. &ldquo;Yet I must report all this as serious. This is the strain on me. That I must be serious, and I must exhaust myself trying to find out what is true and what is fraud and yet, even after I know, I must take them both seriously and write of them both as if I did not know the true distinctions between them.&rdquo;</p> <p align="left">White wrote an extended rant in the letter about wishing he had &ldquo;a pair of glasses with a particular phantasmagoric quality of seeing everything clearly without illusions.&rdquo; He likened the president&rsquo;s role to that of America&rsquo;s &ldquo;High Priest,&rdquo; and questioned whether Kennedy and Nixon were really committed to their campaign promises. He was critical of them for acting as though &ldquo;to become President &hellip; he must be elected on the illusion that somewhere there is an IBM machine that will respond to his touch and solve everything without requiring exertion of them.&rdquo;</p> <p align="left">In photographs from 1960, White looks older than his years. &ldquo;You know&mdash;here I am 45 years old and at this stage of the campaign I feel like 65,&rdquo; he wrote to a friend a month before the election. White smoked too much and drank too much, and he frequently suffered from exhaustion. &ldquo;I am tired, tired, tired, tired to the bone,&rdquo; White wrote near the end of the letter to Bennahum.</p> <p align="left">Little of White&rsquo;s cynicism would carry through into his writing. Even as his personal letters reflected the dispiriting grind of the political process up close,&nbsp;<em>The Making of the President 1960</em>&nbsp;focused on its strengths. The book is propelled by great sweep and grandeur&mdash;America as the modern manifestation of Greece and Rome, and the 1960 election as a powerful symbol to all the world that the United States is a democracy whose people gather every four years to assert a noble and collective wisdom. &ldquo;The general vote is an expression of national will, the only substitute for violence and blood,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Its verdict is to be defended as one defends civilization itself.&rdquo;</p> <p align="left">White captures the big revelations and the small&mdash;tracing the growth and maturation of the candidates but also bringing readers inside the campaign tent for the first time, explaining to them the intricacies known to trail veterans. &ldquo;Watch the smiles,&rdquo; he once commented, explaining how to judge campaign crowds. &ldquo;How long do they last after the candidate is gone? Watch a factory man shake hands. The better he likes a candidate, the harder he wipes off his hand before he sticks it out. Look at the babies in the crowd. They&rsquo;re a good omen for a candidate. It means those parents think he can win and want their kids to be able to say they were there when.&rdquo;</p> <p align="left">He became particularly close to the Kennedys, admitting years later that he had crossed the line from reporter to friend. In June 1960, after the Montana state nominating convention, White was traveling with Kennedy when the candidate learned that a news agency was reporting that he had offered a position in a future administration to Robert Meyner, the governor of New Jersey. Kennedy called the news desk at the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;and, flattening his Boston accent in imitation of press aide Pierre Salinger, provided a statement denying the report. That evening, White flew with Kennedy to Cape Cod. The two discussed books and Winston Churchill and whether JFK would pick Lyndon Johnson&mdash;that &ldquo;egomaniac,&rdquo; as Kennedy described him&mdash;to be his running mate. White left those anecdotes out of&nbsp;<em>The Making of the President 1960</em>, but he recalled them in his memoir years later. &ldquo;It was perhaps at this point that I think I moved or was drawn across the line of reporting to friendship,&rdquo; he said. As Evan Thomas says today, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s access journalism. He&rsquo;s sucking up to the people he needs to suck up to, and he&rsquo;s an artist at it. The lengths to which he went to cultivate and suck up to the Kennedys border on the comic, but they&rsquo;re also skillful and artful, and they worked.&rdquo;</p> <p id='page_03'></p> <p align="left">Whether you call it sucking up or mere flattery, White found it worked better with the Kennedy team&mdash;he watched JFK accept the Democratic nomination on TV with the campaign&rsquo;s inner circle&mdash;than with Nixon&rsquo;s crew. (Nixon&rsquo;s campaign identified him on travel manifests as &ldquo;Theodore White, Novelist.&rdquo;) Although White traveled with Nixon&rsquo;s press corps on several campaign swings, he wouldn&rsquo;t develop a full picture of the Republican nominee until he got greater access for his books about the 1968 and 1972 elections.</p> <p align="left">In the last week of October 1960, White traveled with Nixon in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. Then he descended on Boston with Kennedy&rsquo;s press corps. JFK&rsquo;s last speech of the campaign&mdash;&ldquo;a bad performance,&rdquo; White recalled&mdash;was at Boston Garden. White was not with Kennedy on Election Day, but he recreates the scene at the Kennedy compound at Hyannis Port in lush detail in the opening pages of his book.</p> <p align="left">In the months after the election, White interviewed Kennedy&rsquo;s advisers extensively about those things he could not see for himself, including the moment when Ted Sorensen told Kennedy on the morning after the election that he was to be the next president of the United States: As reported by White, Kennedy was wearing pajamas at the time, and there was a football resting on the lawn outside.</p> <p align="left">In the end, White got a bit lucky too&mdash;the 1960 campaign pitting Nixon against the upstart Kennedy turned out to be the closest election at that point in history and ushered in a glamorous new era in Washington that captivated readers, an era that White himself would give a name to in the coming years.</p> <p align="left">White began writing the book two days after the election and completed it in March. &ldquo;He asked me to report that he is gloomy, exhausted and nervous,&rdquo; his wife wrote to a friend during the months while he was writing. The editing process continued into April and May. As White wrote, &ldquo;I suppose my nerves are just plain shot from the exertion&mdash;I did 175,000 words in three and a half months&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll regret it for the next six months. Meanwhile I know I&rsquo;m impossible and difficult for everyone&mdash;for Nance, for the kids.&rdquo; The finished result was one part thrilling romp, one part heroic narrative and one part personal agenda&mdash;celebrating the rise of Kennedy and the loss of the glowering Nixon.</p> <p align="left">The public loved it. On June 30, a few days before the book was to go on sale, publisher Atheneum sent White a royalty statement showing that with the advance sales of 45,000 hardcover copies, an excerpt in&nbsp;<em>Reader&rsquo;s Digest</em>&nbsp;($25,000) and a fee for the paperback rights ($32,500), White had made more than $130,000 even before the book&rsquo;s publication, the equivalent of about $1 million today. &ldquo;This is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one,&rdquo; Orville Prescott of the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1961/07/05/issue.html">wrote in his review</a>. &ldquo;What might have been only warmed-over topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>Saturday Review</em>&nbsp;called the book &ldquo;an extraordinary performance by a shrewd interpreter of the American scene.&rdquo;</p> <p align="left">White&rsquo;s book was a huge commercial success, staying on best-seller lists for nearly a year, and it won the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1962">1962 Pulitzer Prize</a>&nbsp;for nonfiction. It is widely considered the godfather of the great presidential campaign narratives that followed. As Balz says, &ldquo;It was a great campaign. It was a great moment in the history of the country, and he was able to capture it so well.&rdquo;</p> <p align="center">***</p> <p align="left"><strong>During the campaign and soon after it ended,</strong>&nbsp;White became a trusted confidant of the Kennedy clan. So it&rsquo;s not altogether surprising that after JFK&rsquo;s assassination in November 1963, Jackie Kennedy reached out to White to help tell her story. Teddy traveled once again to Hyannis Port and, together with the still-grieving widow, hatched the article in&nbsp;<em>Life</em>&nbsp;that would define the Kennedy era. The magazine&rsquo;s editors held the issue open long past deadline so that White could dictate the story over the phone from the Kennedy compound.</p> <p align="left">On December 6, 1963,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.originallifemagazines.com/LIFE-Magazine-December-6-1963-P1784.aspx"><em>Life</em></a>&nbsp;published White&rsquo;s short essay, &ldquo;<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=T1IEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=LIFE+Dec+6,+1963+epilogue+white&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5n4uVY7cBa7jsATPj4DgDQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=LIFE%20Dec%206%2C%201963%20epilogue%20white&amp;f=false">An Epilogue for President Kennedy</a>.&rdquo; &ldquo;At night, before we&rsquo;d go to sleep,&rdquo; White quotes Jackie in the two-page essay, &ldquo;Jack liked to play some records; and the song he loved most came at the very end of this record. The lines he loved to hear were:&nbsp;<em>Don&rsquo;t let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot</em>.&rdquo;</p> <p align="left">&ldquo;You must think of him as this little boy,&rdquo; Jackie said, &ldquo;sick so much of the time, reading in bed, reading history, reading the Knights of the Round Table, reading Marlborough. For Jack, history was full of heroes. And if it made him this way&mdash;if it made him see the heroes&mdash;maybe other little boys will see. Men are such a combination of good and bad. Jack had this hero idea of history, the idealistic view.&rdquo;</p> <p align="left">As White would acknowledge later, Camelot was more legend than reality. But he was as caught up in the moment as anyone else close to the Kennedys. &ldquo;Quite inadvertently,&rdquo; White wrote years later, &ldquo;I was her instrument in labeling the myth.&rdquo;</p> <p align="left">White revisited his approach in&nbsp;<em>Making of the President</em>&nbsp;books about the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-President-1964-Theodore-White/dp/0061900613">1964</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-President-1968-Landmark-Political/dp/0061900648">1968</a>&nbsp;and<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-President-1972-Landmark-Political/dp/0061900672">&nbsp;1972</a>&nbsp;campaigns. All four books were commercial successes, but the first is considered the best and most influential. That is partly because White never again had the field to himself. His approach would be copied by Joe McGinnis in 1968, Hunter S. Thompson in 1972 and Richard Ben Cramer in 1988, among others.&nbsp;<em>Newsweek</em>&nbsp;in subsequent election cycles would devote whole teams to gathering the you-were-there color, tidbits and scoops that would see print only after the campaign&rsquo;s conclusion. Reporters would be labeled as having &ldquo;<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=rVjYU5EMDQoC&amp;pg=PT49&amp;lpg=PT49&amp;dq=%22Teddy+White+syndrome%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d0qNJ9aRhd&amp;sig=H6UlPEWk-7qNBFvgB1k2UgMY4Nc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gkglVca0CcaCsAX2gIG4Cg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Teddy%20White%20syndrome%22&amp;f=false">Teddy White syndrome</a>&rdquo; as they tried to out-scoop one another.</p>

<p align="left">White had helped turn the election campaign bus into such a place of fame and celebrity that by 1972, the reporters on the campaign trail were celebrated in their own rollicking narrative&mdash;Timothy Crouse&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Boys-Bus-Timothy-Crouse/dp/0812968204"><em>The Boys on the Bus</em></a>. Fittingly, in Crouse&rsquo;s pages White&rsquo;s doubts about his legacy crept out into the open. White admitted being torn about his up-close-and-personal style of journalism, believing the media scrum on the campaign trail had become too much of a circus. &ldquo;He sometimes felt that the methods he had pioneered had gotten out of control, had turned into a Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster,&rdquo; Crouse&nbsp;<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=rVjYU5EMDQoC&amp;pg=PT49&amp;lpg=PT49&amp;dq=%22He+sometimes+felt+that+the+methods+he+had+pioneered+had+gotten+out+of+control,+had+turned+into+a+Frankenstein%E2%80%99s+monster%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d0qNIcbLea&amp;sig=2kojZY-g0nwhamsFxSXgecUxwuM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gDgkVZeeDcOSsAWNqIGgCA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22He%20sometimes%20felt%20that%20the%20methods%20he%20had%20pioneered%20had%20gotten%20out%20of%20control%2C%20had%20turned%20into%20a%20Frankenstein%E2%80%99s%20monster%22&amp;f=false">wrote</a>. &ldquo;Thinking back to the early spring of 1960, he remembered watching a relaxed John Kennedy receiving the Wisconsin primary returns in a Milwaukee hotel room. White had been the only journalist present, except for a young filmmaker working on a documentary, and he had blended in with the Kennedy Mafia as unobtrusively as a distant in-law.&rdquo;</p> <p align="left">White then recalled being in George McGovern&rsquo;s hotel suite when he won the 1972 Democratic nomination in Miami Beach. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s appalling what we&rsquo;ve done to these guys,&rdquo; White&nbsp;<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=rVjYU5EMDQoC&amp;pg=PT49&amp;lpg=PT49&amp;dq=%22He+sometimes+felt+that+the+methods+he+had+pioneered+had+gotten+out+of+control,+had+turned+into+a+Frankenstein%E2%80%99s+monster%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d0qNIcbLea&amp;sig=2kojZY-g0nwhamsFxSXgecUxwuM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gDgkVZeeDcOSsAWNqIGgCA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22It%E2%80%99s%20appalling%20what%20we%E2%80%99ve%20done%20to%20these%20guys%22&amp;f=false">told Crouse</a>. &ldquo;McGovern was like a fish in a fishbowl. There were three different network crews at different times. The still photographers kept coming in in groups of five. And there were at least six writers sitting in the corner&mdash;I don&rsquo;t even know their names. We&rsquo;re all sitting there watching him work on his acceptance speech, poor bastard. He tries to go into the bedroom with Fred Dutton to go over the list of vice presidents, which would later turn out to be the fuck-up of the century, of course, and all of us are observing him, taking notes like mad, getting all the little details. Which I think I invented as a method of reporting and which I now sincerely regret. If you write about this, say that I sincerely regret it. Who gives a fuck if the guy had milk and Total for breakfast?&rdquo;</p> <p align="left">Today, of course, thanks in large part to Teddy White, everyone does.</p>
