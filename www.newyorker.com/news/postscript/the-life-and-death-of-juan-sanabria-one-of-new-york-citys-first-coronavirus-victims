The version below appears in the April 20, 2020, issue.*\n\n-=-=-=-\nAt 860 Grand Concourse, a residential apartment building in the Bronx, the doorman’s post is just inside the front door, on a landing between two flights of stairs. One of them leads up to the offices of a dentist and a lawyer, who, along with several physicians, rent commercial space. The other goes down past two pairs of gold-painted columns and into the main lobby, where an elevator services seven floors with a hundred and eleven apartments. Tuesday through Saturday, between eight in the morning and five in the evening, tenants going down to or coming up from the lobby could expect a greeting from a trim, punctilious man with close-cropped hair. He wore a navy-blue uniform that hung loosely off his narrow shoulders. His name was Juan Sanabria.\n\nThere was an art to Sanabria’s salutations. Dana Frishkorn, who’s lived in the building for three and a half years, appreciated that he called her by her first name when she entered, and never failed to tell her “Take care” when she left. Yet somehow Sanabria knew that Anthony Tucker, who has spent five years in the building, preferred to be called by his last name. “Hey, Tuck,” Sanabria would say, extending his hand for a fist bump. When Tony Chen, who runs a boutique tour company and lives on the seventh floor, limped into the building one morning, addled by plantar fasciitis, Sanabria showed him a foot stretch that helped. On another day, when a tenant showed up at the front door with a large couch to take up to his apartment, even though the building’s rules mandated the use of a side door, Sanabria stood watch to make sure a meddlesome neighbor didn’t wander over.\n\n\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5e6a8d2525cee1000833d9fd]||||||\n\n“With Juan, you always got the sense that he was more knowledgeable than he let on,” Georgeen Comerford, who has lived in the building for nearly fifty years, told me. A photography professor at *CUNY*{: .small}, she described Sanabria as a “mensch who appreciated the ironies.” He would call her *mámi*, and wink, when she passed through the lobby. It wasn’t just that you were glad to see him, she said. “If you didn’t see him, you wanted to know where he was. When he wasn’t around, you felt it.”\n\nUncharacteristically, Sanabria wasn’t around the last week of February. His eighty-two-year-old mother, with whom he shared an apartment on Ogden Avenue, was suffering from emphysema; he had taken her to a nearby hospital. When word spread in the building that Sanabria’s mother was ill, no one was surprised to learn that he was by her side. “It was who he was,” Jimmy Montalvo, one of the other doormen, told me. Montalvo and Sanabria were neighbors—Montalvo got his job at the building through Sanabria, three years ago—and frequently had breakfast together at their corner bodega; Sanabria was always bringing food back for his mother, Montalvo said. “He took good care of her.” Even when Sanabria was away from 860 Grand Concourse, during a break or on his days off, he gave the impression that he was never far. James Tirado, the youngest and newest doorman on staff, used to get calls and texts from Sanabria, checking up on him. “How’s the day going?” Sanabria would ask. “Is everything going O.K. for you?”\n\nBy the time his mother’s health had improved, and Sanabria returned to work, on March 3rd, he was beginning to feel ill himself. There were still very few publicly known *COVID*{: .small}\\-19 cases in New York City, and his symptoms—dizziness and fatigue—were not yet widely associated with the disease. He wasn’t coughing, and he didn’t have a fever. He went home anyway, to rest for a few days. On Monday, March 9th, his day off, he returned to 860 Grand Concourse, to consult with a doctor on the first floor—his “doctor friend,” he called him. He was feeling worse, and had developed a cough. Tirado noticed him wheezing as he passed the doorman’s post.\n\nWhile he waited for the doctor, Sanabria called one of his stepdaughters, Walkiris Cruz-Perez, a nurse at Columbia-Presbyterian. She was in the Dominican Republic at the time, getting dental work done, but she was concerned enough to call him an ambulance. “He would never call one for himself,” she said. “But I made him promise me one thing. I said to him, ‘Go to Columbia. Go to *my* hospital. Don’t go to Lincoln.’&nbsp;” She was referring to the Bronx hospital where Sanabria was born, and which he held in almost superstitiously high esteem. Lincoln was where he had taken his mother a week earlier, and where one of his best friends had died, a few years before. He’d even considered applying for a part-time job there as a security guard.\n\nIt took about twenty minutes for the ambulance to arrive and for the orderlies to load him into the back. Not yet feverish, he insisted—in his usual, stoic way—that he was feeling just fine. What was most telling, though, was the fact that he did not object to being taken to the hospital; almost compulsively protective of others, he was finally ceding control to someone else, which struck Walkiris as worrisome. She talked him through the situation on FaceTime, as Tirado watched from the door. It would be the last time anyone from the building saw Sanabria.\n\n-=-=-=-\nIn the days after Sanabria’s death, his former tenants and co-workers staggered between shock and grief. Contributing to the over-all sense of loss was their collective realization that, while they each felt close to him, most of them actually knew little about him. Montalvo, for instance, was vaguely aware that Sanabria had served in the military, yet he never learned any of the details. One tenant in the building, a thirty-eight-year-old nurse and Navy reservist named Frankie Hamilton, knew about Sanabria’s time in the Navy because they swapped stories about training at a facility near Throgs Neck, in the Bronx. But he didn’t know anything about Sanabria’s family. Another tenant told me, “I kept hearing that he had a daughter who was a nurse, but also that his daughter was a cop. Which was it?”\n\nHe had two stepdaughters, actually—a nurse *and* an N.Y.P.D. officer. He spoke about each of them constantly, with an unabashed and even grandiloquent sense of pride. Yet he shared stories about them in different ways to different people. Julia Donahue-Wait, a registered nurse herself, knew all about Walkiris’s career. But she would be at work during the day, when Sanabria’s other stepdaughter, Waleska, often dropped in to meet him for lunch. Waleska’s precinct, the Forty-fourth, includes the stretch of Grand Concourse where Sanabria worked. Several times a week, they went to a deli down the street and ate in his break room at the building. “When I didn’t have time, we would stand at the front door and talk about my son,” Waleska told me. Their conversations revolved around three things, she said: her child, her mother, and her work. “He loved that I was a cop. He was always telling me about things that would happen around the neighborhood.”\n\nSanabria, the son of Puerto Rican parents, grew up near the old Yankee Stadium, in the Bronx. After high school, he joined the Navy, where he served for the next twenty years. Travelling was an obsession of his—in the service, he spent time in the Philippines and the Bahamas—but he also loved structure and a sense of routine. “I used to say to him, ‘Juan, you’re just weird\\!’&nbsp;” Mimi Roman, his oldest friend, told me. (The two of them were born on the same day: August 13, 1967.) “He had to have everything in order. He’d always have his way of doing things.” After he was given a diagnosis of celiac disease, a digestive disorder that rendered him allergic to gluten, he adjusted his diet and stuck to it. “It was always everything in moderation,” Roman said.\n\nIn his mid-thirties, Sanabria retired from the military and returned home, finding a job as a janitor at a local elementary school. The youngest of four children, he was fanatically devoted to his parents; he worked overtime so that they’d have money to take vacations. In 2003, looking for an additional source of income, he began working part time at 860 Grand Concourse, covering odd shifts and filling in for the other doormen when they were sick or on vacation. He was perfectly suited for a job that rewarded dependability and charm. Unflaggingly serious about work, he also had a mischievous side, playing practical jokes and making people laugh. “He had goals in life,” Roman said. “He wanted to achieve things. He didn’t want to ever be stuck. He knew all about his surroundings. He was up on things. I used to call him ‘the news’ because he always knew what was going on.”\n\nHe met Raquel Ramos, his partner of eleven years, at a dominoes game across the street from his apartment. She was Dominican, and nine years his senior; she had two daughters, two sons, and three grandchildren, whom Sanabria immediately treated like family. I asked Waleska if it took time for her, her sister, and their children to respond in kind. “Not at all,” she said. “He was a great guy, and we saw how much he loved our mother.” When Waleska got married, he was there, presiding just as any father would, and when, in 2014, she got a divorce, he helped her find and pay for a lawyer. “He was the only one who helped me with that,” she said. “He was the type of man I’d want my son to become. The type of person I would love for my nieces to marry.”\n\nHe also grew close to Walkiris’s two daughters, who used to stay with their grandmother while Walkiris was at nursing school and, later, at the hospital. Sanabria was almost always there. After leaving 860 Grand Concourse, he’d stop off at his apartment to give his mother dinner, then travel to Washington Heights to be with the rest of his family. Walkiris’s younger daughter, Emeli, who’s now thirteen, came to expect a text message from him every day at three-thirty, just as she was leaving school, to make sure she was coming over for dinner. “His life was my mom, his mom, his grandchildren, and his job,” Walkiris told me.\n\n-=-=-=-\nA few hours after calling the ambulance for Sanabria, Walkiris checked in with him on FaceTime. He was in a hospital bed, but she didn’t recognize the walls and surroundings behind him. “Juan, I’m going to kick your ass\\!” she said. It wasn’t that she had any particular reason to distrust the care he would receive at Lincoln Hospital, as opposed to Columbia-Presbyterian; she just wanted him to be at the facility she knew, the place in which she had the greatest faith. “I was born here,” he replied. “Anyway, I just have a cough. You’re making too much of this.” She told him, “Your face is red. You clearly have a fever. This is serious.”\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5e8fa604d2568400081f30f5]\n\n+++\n\nA doctor in a hazmat suit entered the room and asked for Sanabria’s phone so he could speak to Walkiris outside. The test results hadn’t come back yet, he told her, but Sanabria’s symptoms, including the images of his lungs taken from a CT scan, matched the profile of *COVID*{: .small}\\-19, based on documented cases out of Wuhan, in China. Walkiris flew home that afternoon, and went straight to the hospital. When she arrived, with her suitcases in tow, Sanabria was in quarantine.\n\nSix years ago, Sanabria had asked Walkiris to be his health-care proxy. He was forty-six at the time, and in good health. She never understood why he raised the issue with her. But he insisted—“I know you’ll take good care of me,” he said—and she agreed. As a result, she was legally allowed to enter his room at Lincoln Hospital, though doing so would have been extremely dangerous under the circumstances. That Monday night, she spoke to him from outside his door, again on FaceTime, and they agreed that she would go home and return in the morning. By then, he had full-fledged pneumonia, and was getting oxygen through a tube inserted in his nose. His face had flushed to a deep red.\n\nAt eight o’clock the next morning, the doctor called Walkiris and asked her to help persuade Sanabria to be intubated. He’d deteriorated overnight, and now needed to be on a respirator. “Am I going to die?” Sanabria asked Walkiris. “No, *pápi*,” she told him. “They’re going to put you to sleep for a little while, so you can relax your lungs. You’re breathing too fast.” He seemed dazed. “I don’t feel sick,” he said calmly. “Will you be here when I wake up?”\n\n“I’ll see you on the other side,” she replied. “Let them do this.” As the nurses prepared to intubate him, he bragged about how his daughter was a nurse. Just before he went under, he sent Walkiris one last selfie.\n\nBy March 10th, Mayor Bill de Blasio had announced thirty-six confirmed *COVID*{: .small}\\-19 cases in New York City. It isn’t clear whether Sanabria was counted among them. Most likely, he wasn’t yet. It would be another four days before the first deaths in the city were made public. The patients were elderly—one was eighty-two, another seventy-nine—and they had underlying medical conditions. It seemed inconceivable that Sanabria would suffer a similar fate.\n\n+++feature-default\n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5e83bde9ba0e6f0009421c7e]\n\n+++\n{: legacyType=\"feature-small\"}\n\nWalkiris returned to the hospital around six that evening. The thought of Sanabria lying alone in the intensive-care unit had grown intolerable, and she was determined to see him, despite the risk of getting infected herself. “I figured I’d already been in contact with the virus anyway,” she said. “I may as well be exposed to family.” She approached his room, but a doctor, who had introduced herself as Dr.&nbsp;K., intercepted her. Walkiris was crying, and pleaded to be allowed inside. Dr. K. held her firmly by the arms, and told her to close her eyes. “I want you to visualize a conversation I’m going to have right now with your father,” the doctor told her. “Imagine I’m walking into his room as his doctor, and asking him if he would feel comfortable with you coming in to see him. I’m telling him about the risks to you and your family if you went in there. What would he say? Would he want you to say goodbye to his spirit in there, or out here?” Walkiris told me later that, in that moment, the doctor may have saved her life.\n\nThe reality fully set in on Thursday, March 12th, when a colleague invited her to join a private Facebook group of doctors and nurses at Columbia-Presbyterian. One of the doctors had shared a chart detailing the progression of fatal *COVID*{: .small}\\-19 cases. Patients who eventually died from the disease entered the emergency room with normal heart function, then suffered total respiratory failure. Under typical circumstances, such a failure would coincide with sepsis or shock, but that wasn’t the case for many with *COVID*{: .small}\\-19. These patients might appear to stabilize and even to improve. Yet within hours their condition would deteriorate once more, this time irreparably, and their heart function would swiftly decline. “It was his presentation exactly,” Walkiris said. “I can’t even explain it to you. That’s when I really knew. All I could do was cry.”\n\nThe next day, Juan’s blood pressure dropped precipitately. Walkiris’s sister and mother tried to visit him in the hospital, too, but were turned away. They told Walkiris to pray. “I kept telling them, ‘Look at this chart. He doesn’t even have a few days,’&nbsp;” Walkiris said. “My family didn’t want to hear it.” He never regained consciousness after being intubated; by the time he died, on March 17th, no one had been able to say goodbye.\n\n-=-=-=-\nThe management company at 860 Grand Concourse sent a notice to the building’s residents later that night. “We have been informed that Juan Sanabria, daytime Doorman has passed away this morning,” it said. “His family informed Management that he tested Positive for Coronavirus.” That was the only reference to him and his family that appeared in the notice; the rest of it listed a new battery of precautions that the building would be implementing—increased frequency of cleaning and daily disinfecting—along with recommendations from the New York City Health Department for how to avoid spreading or contracting the virus. Many of the residents were put off by the impersonal tone, one of them, a journalist named Alice Speri, told me. “I have been thinking about Juan non-stop since he passed,” Speri said. “He was such a regular, happy part of our daily lives. I know that every time I walk through the building’s door I won’t be able to not think about him.”\n\nGeorgeen Comerford was at home when she received the notice. A few days earlier, Jimmy Montalvo had told her that Sanabria was sick. “I thought immediately about the virus,” she told me. One morning, while Sanabria was in the hospital, she went downstairs to ask James Tirado, who was on duty, if he knew more about the situation. “I can’t even talk about it,” he had told her, choking back tears. She began to brace herself for the worst—“It was like you were letting air out of the balloon,” she said—but she was still unprepared for the announcement of his death. “It was a punch in the stomach,” she said.\n\nEarly the next day, Comerford listened to the news on the radio. By then, *CUNY*{: .small} had moved classes online. Isolated in her apartment, she found herself trying to piece together how Sanabria fit into the broader account of what was developing in the city. He’d been among the first fatalities. “Was he the eleventh person who died? I was trying to figure out if he was the tenth or the eleventh,” Comerford told me. “That made this whole thing very real. Before, the deaths were just statistics. Knowing that one of them was Juan, it gave the thing a face.”\n\nAt 860 Grand Concourse, everyone’s anguish is now tinged with fear. A week after Sanabria died, there was another confirmed case of *COVID*{: .small}\\-19 in the building. Montalvo and Tirado were growing uncomfortable working the door, and were trying to scale back their hours without management docking their pay. When we last spoke, at the end of March, Montalvo was in touch with a union representative to figure out whether staying home would count against his sick days. There was money but also safety to consider, he told me. They’d been exposed to Sanabria themselves, and yet, in some ways, that was the least of it. “We have a friend, not just our co-worker, who died, too,” he told me.\n\nMeanwhile, because the cause of death was *COVID*{: .small}\\-19, none of the mortuaries that Walkiris and her family called were willing to pick up Sanabria’s body; his corpse remained in the hospital morgue for nine days before one service finally agreed to help. A funeral was out of the question. All of Sanabria’s family members spent fourteen days in quarantine. The only one of them to show any symptoms was his mother, who had stomach pain and a low-grade fever. She ultimately tested positive for *COVID*{: .small}\\-19, but her symptoms remained mild; she’s since recovered. Waleska went back to work on Sunday, March&nbsp;29th. She had been nervous about returning to her beat—not because of the coronavirus or anything specific about the job. She would have to patrol past 860 Grand Concourse. “And that is where I’ll see him,” she said.\n\nSanabria’s cell phone, which the hospital gave to Walkiris, was full of voice memos and missed calls. Listening to them, Walkiris heard friends of his, most of whom she’d never met, calling him Juanito and Juancho. “Everyone had a distinctive thing,” she said. She realized that he’d been as reliable and routine-oriented with his friends as he’d always been with his family; people were calling because he used to check up on them regularly, and, when they hadn’t heard from him, they worried that something was wrong. Eventually, Walkiris signed on to his Facebook account to post the news. “Juan Sanabria passed away due to coronavirus,” she wrote. “My dad was a loving man who was a respected son, father, and grandfather. Please in light of what is going on in the world please tell your loved ones how much you love them.

April 1, 2020, at 6 <em class="small">A</em>.<em class="small">M</em>. The version below appears in the April 20, 2020, issue.</em></p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">At 860 Grand Concourse, a residential apartment building in the Bronx, the doorman’s post is just inside the front door, on a landing between two flights of stairs. One of them leads up to the offices of a dentist and a lawyer, who, along with several physicians, rent commercial space. The other goes down past two pairs of gold-painted columns and into the main lobby, where an elevator services seven floors with a hundred and eleven apartments. Tuesday through Saturday, between eight in the morning and five in the evening, tenants going down to or coming up from the lobby could expect a greeting from a trim, punctilious man with close-cropped hair. He wore a navy-blue uniform that hung loosely off his narrow shoulders. His name was Juan Sanabria.</p><div class="consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit--no-failsafe"><div class="consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content"></div></div><div class="ad ad--in-content"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"></div></div><p>There was an art to Sanabria’s salutations. Dana Frishkorn, who’s lived in the building for three and a half years, appreciated that he called her by her first name when she entered, and never failed to tell her “Take care” when she left. Yet somehow Sanabria knew that Anthony Tucker, who has spent five years in the building, preferred to be called by his last name. “Hey, Tuck,” Sanabria would say, extending his hand for a fist bump. When Tony Chen, who runs a boutique tour company and lives on the seventh floor, limped into the building one morning, addled by plantar fasciitis, Sanabria showed him a foot stretch that helped. On another day, when a tenant showed up at the front door with a large couch to take up to his apartment, even though the building’s rules mandated the use of a side door, Sanabria stood watch to make sure a meddlesome neighbor didn’t wander over.</p><div class="external-link-embed external-link-embed--inline"><div class="external-link-embed__text external-link-embed__text--col-size-large"><a aria-label="&lt;em&gt;The New Yorker’s&lt;/em&gt; coronavirus news coverage and analysis are free for all readers." class="external-link external-link-embed__hed-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><p class="external-link-embed__hed"><em>The New Yorker’s</em> coronavirus news coverage and analysis are free for all readers.</p></a></div></div><p>“With Juan, you always got the sense that he was more knowledgeable than he let on,” Georgeen Comerford, who has lived in the building for nearly fifty years, told me. A photography professor at <em class="small">CUNY</em>, she described Sanabria as a “mensch who appreciated the ironies.” He would call her <em>mámi</em>, and wink, when she passed through the lobby. It wasn’t just that you were glad to see him, she said. “If you didn’t see him, you wanted to know where he was. When he wasn’t around, you felt it.”</p><p>Uncharacteristically, Sanabria wasn’t around the last week of February. His eighty-two-year-old mother, with whom he shared an apartment on Ogden Avenue, was suffering from emphysema; he had taken her to a nearby hospital. When word spread in the building that Sanabria’s mother was ill, no one was surprised to learn that he was by her side. “It was who he was,” Jimmy Montalvo, one of the other doormen, told me. Montalvo and Sanabria were neighbors—Montalvo got his job at the building through Sanabria, three years ago—and frequently had breakfast together at their corner bodega; Sanabria was always bringing food back for his mother, Montalvo said. “He took good care of her.” Even when Sanabria was away from 860 Grand Concourse, during a break or on his days off, he gave the impression that he was never far. James Tirado, the youngest and newest doorman on staff, used to get calls and texts from Sanabria, checking up on him. “How’s the day going?” Sanabria would ask. “Is everything going O.K. for you?”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-1 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>By the time his mother’s health had improved, and Sanabria returned to work, on March 3rd, he was beginning to feel ill himself. There were still very few publicly known <em class="small">COVID</em>-19 cases in New York City, and his symptoms—dizziness and fatigue—were not yet widely associated with the disease. He wasn’t coughing, and he didn’t have a fever. He went home anyway, to rest for a few days. On Monday, March 9th, his day off, he returned to 860 Grand Concourse, to consult with a doctor on the first floor—his “doctor friend,” he called him. He was feeling worse, and had developed a cough. Tirado noticed him wheezing as he passed the doorman’s post.</p><p>While he waited for the doctor, Sanabria called one of his stepdaughters, Walkiris Cruz-Perez, a nurse at Columbia-Presbyterian. She was in the Dominican Republic at the time, getting dental work done, but she was concerned enough to call him an ambulance. “He would never call one for himself,” she said. “But I made him promise me one thing. I said to him, ‘Go to Columbia. Go to <em>my</em> hospital. Don’t go to Lincoln.’ ” She was referring to the Bronx hospital where Sanabria was born, and which he held in almost superstitiously high esteem. Lincoln was where he had taken his mother a week earlier, and where one of his best friends had died, a few years before. He’d even considered applying for a part-time job there as a security guard.</p><p>It took about twenty minutes for the ambulance to arrive and for the orderlies to load him into the back. Not yet feverish, he insisted—in his usual, stoic way—that he was feeling just fine. What was most telling, though, was the fact that he did not object to being taken to the hospital; almost compulsively protective of others, he was finally ceding control to someone else, which struck Walkiris as worrisome. She talked him through the situation on FaceTime, as Tirado watched from the door. It would be the last time anyone from the building saw Sanabria.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">In the days after Sanabria’s death, his former tenants and co-workers staggered between shock and grief. Contributing to the over-all sense of loss was their collective realization that, while they each felt close to him, most of them actually knew little about him. Montalvo, for instance, was vaguely aware that Sanabria had served in the military, yet he never learned any of the details. One tenant in the building, a thirty-eight-year-old nurse and Navy reservist named Frankie Hamilton, knew about Sanabria’s time in the Navy because they swapped stories about training at a facility near Throgs Neck, in the Bronx. But he didn’t know anything about Sanabria’s family. Another tenant told me, “I kept hearing that he had a daughter who was a nurse, but also that his daughter was a cop. Which was it?”</p><p>He had two stepdaughters, actually—a nurse <em>and</em> an N.Y.P.D. officer. He spoke about each of them constantly, with an unabashed and even grandiloquent sense of pride. Yet he shared stories about them in different ways to different people. Julia Donahue-Wait, a registered nurse herself, knew all about Walkiris’s career. But she would be at work during the day, when Sanabria’s other stepdaughter, Waleska, often dropped in to meet him for lunch. Waleska’s precinct, the Forty-fourth, includes the stretch of Grand Concourse where Sanabria worked. Several times a week, they went to a deli down the street and ate in his break room at the building. “When I didn’t have time, we would stand at the front door and talk about my son,” Waleska told me. Their conversations revolved around three things, she said: her child, her mother, and her work. “He loved that I was a cop. He was always telling me about things that would happen around the neighborhood.”</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><aside class="persistent-aside" style="position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></aside></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>Sanabria, the son of Puerto Rican parents, grew up near the old Yankee Stadium, in the Bronx. After high school, he joined the Navy, where he served for the next twenty years. Travelling was an obsession of his—in the service, he spent time in the Philippines and the Bahamas—but he also loved structure and a sense of routine. “I used to say to him, ‘Juan, you’re just weird!’ ” Mimi Roman, his oldest friend, told me. (The two of them were born on the same day: August 13, 1967.) “He had to have everything in order. He’d always have his way of doing things.” After he was given a diagnosis of celiac disease, a digestive disorder that rendered him allergic to gluten, he adjusted his diet and stuck to it. “It was always everything in moderation,” Roman said.</p><p>In his mid-thirties, Sanabria retired from the military and returned home, finding a job as a janitor at a local elementary school. The youngest of four children, he was fanatically devoted to his parents; he worked overtime so that they’d have money to take vacations. In 2003, looking for an additional source of income, he began working part time at 860 Grand Concourse, covering odd shifts and filling in for the other doormen when they were sick or on vacation. He was perfectly suited for a job that rewarded dependability and charm. Unflaggingly serious about work, he also had a mischievous side, playing practical jokes and making people laugh. “He had goals in life,” Roman said. “He wanted to achieve things. He didn’t want to ever be stuck. He knew all about his surroundings. He was up on things. I used to call him ‘the news’ because he always knew what was going on.”</p><p>He met Raquel Ramos, his partner of eleven years, at a dominoes game across the street from his apartment. She was Dominican, and nine years his senior; she had two daughters, two sons, and three grandchildren, whom Sanabria immediately treated like family. I asked Waleska if it took time for her, her sister, and their children to respond in kind. “Not at all,” she said. “He was a great guy, and we saw how much he loved our mother.” When Waleska got married, he was there, presiding just as any father would, and when, in 2014, she got a divorce, he helped her find and pay for a lawyer. “He was the only one who helped me with that,” she said. “He was the type of man I’d want my son to become. The type of person I would love for my nieces to marry.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-2 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>He also grew close to Walkiris’s two daughters, who used to stay with their grandmother while Walkiris was at nursing school and, later, at the hospital. Sanabria was almost always there. After leaving 860 Grand Concourse, he’d stop off at his apartment to give his mother dinner, then travel to Washington Heights to be with the rest of his family. Walkiris’s younger daughter, Emeli, who’s now thirteen, came to expect a text message from him every day at three-thirty, just as she was leaving school, to make sure she was coming over for dinner. “His life was my mom, his mom, his grandchildren, and his job,” Walkiris told me.</p><div class="cne-interlude-embed"></div><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">A few hours after calling the ambulance for Sanabria, Walkiris checked in with him on FaceTime. He was in a hospital bed, but she didn’t recognize the walls and surroundings behind him. “Juan, I’m going to kick your ass!” she said. It wasn’t that she had any particular reason to distrust the care he would receive at Lincoln Hospital, as opposed to Columbia-Presbyterian; she just wanted him to be at the facility she knew, the place in which she had the greatest faith. “I was born here,” he replied. “Anyway, I just have a cough. You’re making too much of this.” She told him, “Your face is red. You clearly have a fever. This is serious.”</p><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed callout--content-type--cartoon"><figure class="asset-embed"><div

Walkiris outside. The test results hadn’t come back yet, he told her, but Sanabria’s symptoms, including the images of his lungs taken from a CT scan, matched the profile of <em class="small">COVID</em>-19, based on documented cases out of Wuhan, in China. Walkiris flew home that afternoon, and went straight to the hospital. When she arrived, with her suitcases in tow, Sanabria was in quarantine.</p><p>Six years ago, Sanabria had asked Walkiris to be his health-care proxy. He was forty-six at the time, and in good health. She never understood why he raised the issue with her. But he insisted—“I know you’ll take good care of me,” he said—and she agreed. As a result, she was legally allowed to enter his room at Lincoln Hospital, though doing so would have been extremely dangerous under the circumstances. That Monday night, she spoke to him from outside his door, again on FaceTime, and they agreed that she would go home and return in the morning. By then, he had full-fledged pneumonia, and was getting oxygen through a tube inserted in his nose. His face had flushed to a deep red.</p><p>At eight o’clock the next morning, the doctor called Walkiris and asked her to help persuade Sanabria to be intubated. He’d deteriorated overnight, and now needed to be on a respirator. “Am I going to die?” Sanabria asked Walkiris. “No, <em>pápi</em>,” she told him. “They’re going to put you to sleep for a little while, so you can relax your lungs. You’re breathing too fast.” He seemed dazed. “I don’t feel sick,” he said calmly. “Will you be here when I wake up?”</p><p>“I’ll see you on the other side,” she replied. “Let them do this.” As the nurses prepared to intubate him, he bragged about how his daughter was a nurse. Just before he went under, he sent Walkiris one last selfie.</p><p>By March 10th, Mayor Bill de Blasio had announced thirty-six confirmed <em class="small">COVID</em>-19 cases in New York City. It isn’t clear whether Sanabria was counted among them. Most likely, he wasn’t yet. It would be another four days before the first deaths in the city were made public. The patients were elderly—one was eighty-two, another seventy-nine—and they had underlying medical conditions. It seemed inconceivable that Sanabria would suffer a similar fate.</p><inline-embed childTypes="image" name="feature-default"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="A text conversation between a hospitalized Sanabria and his stepdaughter." class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e83bde9ba0e6f0009421c7e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Blitzer-JuanSanabria-2wide.jpg" srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e83bde9ba0e6f0009421c7e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Blitzer-JuanSanabria-2wide.jpg 1600w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e83bde9ba0e6f0009421c7e/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Blitzer-JuanSanabria-2wide.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e83bde9ba0e6f0009421c7e/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Blitzer-JuanSanabria-2wide.jpg 1024w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e83bde9ba0e6f0009421c7e/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Blitzer-JuanSanabria-2wide.jpg 768w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e83bde9ba0e6f0009421c7e/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Blitzer-JuanSanabria-2wide.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption caption-shade--light"><span class="caption__text">Sanabria was hospitalized on Monday, March 9th, but by the time one of his stepdaughters, Walkiris Cruz-Perez, arrived at the hospital he was already in quarantine.

The thought of Sanabria lying alone in the intensive-care unit had grown intolerable, and she was determined to see him, despite the risk of getting infected herself. “I figured I’d already been in contact with the virus anyway,” she said. “I may as well be exposed to family.” She approached his room, but a doctor, who had introduced herself as Dr. K., intercepted her. Walkiris was crying, and pleaded to be allowed inside. Dr. K. held her firmly by the arms, and told her to close her eyes. “I want you to visualize a conversation I’m going to have right now with your father,” the doctor told her. “Imagine I’m walking into his room as his doctor, and asking him if he would feel comfortable with you coming in to see him. I’m telling him about the risks to you and your family if you went in there. What would he say? Would he want you to say goodbye to his spirit in there, or out here?” Walkiris told me later that, in that moment, the doctor may have saved her life.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>The reality fully set in on Thursday, March 12th, when a colleague invited her to join a private Facebook group of doctors and nurses at Columbia-Presbyterian. One of the doctors had shared a chart detailing the progression of fatal <em class="small">COVID</em>-19 cases. Patients who eventually died from the disease entered the emergency room with normal heart function, then suffered total respiratory failure. Under typical circumstances, such a failure would coincide with sepsis or shock, but that wasn’t the case for many with <em class="small">COVID</em>-19. These patients might appear to stabilize and even to improve. Yet within hours their condition would deteriorate once more, this time irreparably, and their heart function would swiftly decline. “It was his presentation exactly,” Walkiris said. “I can’t even explain it to you. That’s when I really knew. All I could do was cry.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-3 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>The next day, Juan’s blood pressure dropped precipitately. Walkiris’s sister and mother tried to visit him in the hospital, too, but were turned away. They told Walkiris to pray. “I kept telling them, ‘Look at this chart. He doesn’t even have a few days,’ ” Walkiris said. “My family didn’t want to hear it.” He never regained consciousness after being intubated; by the time he died, on March 17th, no one had been able to say goodbye.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">The management company at 860 Grand Concourse sent a notice to the building’s residents later that night. “We have been informed that Juan Sanabria, daytime Doorman has passed away this morning,” it said. “His family informed Management that he tested Positive for Coronavirus.” That was the only reference to him and his family that appeared in the notice; the rest of it listed a new battery of precautions that the building would be implementing—increased frequency of cleaning and daily disinfecting—along with recommendations from the New York City Health Department for how to avoid spreading or contracting the virus. Many of the residents were put off by the impersonal tone, one of them, a journalist named Alice Speri, told me. “I have been thinking about Juan non-stop since he passed,” Speri said. “He was such a regular, happy part of our daily lives. I know that every time I walk through the building’s door I won’t be able to not think about him.”</p><p>Georgeen Comerford was at home when she received the notice. A few days earlier, Jimmy Montalvo had told her that Sanabria was sick. “I thought immediately about the virus,” she told me. One morning, while Sanabria was in the hospital, she went downstairs to ask James Tirado, who was on duty, if he knew more about the situation. “I can’t even talk about it,” he had told her, choking back tears. She began to brace herself for the worst—“It was like you were letting air out of the balloon,” she said—but she was still unprepared for the announcement of his death. “It was a punch in the stomach,” she said.</p><p>Early the next day, Comerford listened to the news on the radio. By then, <em class="small">CUNY</em> had moved classes online. Isolated in her apartment, she found herself trying to piece together how Sanabria fit into the broader account of what was developing in the city. He’d been among the first fatalities. “Was he the eleventh person who died? I was trying to figure out if he was the tenth or the eleventh,” Comerford told me. “That made this whole thing very real. Before, the deaths were just statistics. Knowing that one of them was Juan, it gave the thing a face.”</p><p>At 860 Grand Concourse, everyone’s anguish is now tinged with fear. A week after Sanabria died, there was another confirmed case of <em class="small">COVID</em>-19 in the building. Montalvo and Tirado were growing uncomfortable working the door, and were trying to scale back their hours without management docking their pay. When we last spoke, at the end of March, Montalvo was in touch with a union representative to figure out whether staying home would count against his sick days. There was money but also safety to consider, he told me. They’d been exposed to Sanabria themselves, and yet, in some ways, that was the least of it. “We have a friend, not just our co-worker, who died, too,” he told me.</p><p>Meanwhile, because the cause of death was <em class="small">COVID</em>-19, none of the mortuaries that Walkiris and her family called were willing to pick up Sanabria’s body; his corpse remained in the hospital morgue for nine days before one service finally agreed to help. A funeral was out of the question. All of Sanabria’s family members spent fourteen days in quarantine. The only one of them to show any symptoms was his mother, who had stomach pain and a low-grade fever. She ultimately tested positive for <em class="small">COVID</em>-19, but her symptoms remained mild; she’s since recovered. Waleska went back to work on Sunday, March 29th. She had been nervous about returning to her beat—not because of the coronavirus or anything specific about the job. She would have to patrol past 860 Grand Concourse. “And that is where I’ll see him,” she said.</p><p>Sanabria’s cell phone, which the hospital gave to Walkiris, was full of voice memos and missed calls. Listening to them, Walkiris heard friends of his, most of whom she’d never met, calling him Juanito and Juancho. “Everyone had a distinctive thing,” she said. She realized that he’d been as reliable and routine-oriented with his friends as he’d always been with his family; people were calling because he used to check up on them regularly, and, when they hadn’t heard from him, they worried that something was wrong. Eventually, Walkiris signed on to his Facebook account to post the news. “Juan Sanabria passed away due to coronavirus,” she wrote. “My dad was a loving man who was a respected son, father, and grandfather. Please in light of what is going on in the world please tell your loved ones how much you love them. Once the city allows us to have a service in his name I will make sure to let everyone know.” ♦</p><hr/><h2>A Guide to the Coronavirus</h2><ul><li>How to practice <a

.small}.*M*{: .small}. The version below appears in the April 20, 2020, issue.*\n\n-=-=-=-\nAt 860 Grand Concourse, a residential apartment building in the Bronx, the doorman’s post is just inside the front door, on a landing between two flights of stairs. One of them leads up to the offices of a dentist and a lawyer, who, along with several physicians, rent commercial space. The other goes down past two pairs of gold-painted columns and into the main lobby, where an elevator services seven floors with a hundred and eleven apartments. Tuesday through Saturday, between eight in the morning and five in the evening, tenants going down to or coming up from the lobby could expect a greeting from a trim, punctilious man with close-cropped hair. He wore a navy-blue uniform that hung loosely off his narrow shoulders. His name was Juan Sanabria.\n\nThere was an art to Sanabria’s salutations. Dana Frishkorn, who’s lived in the building for three and a half years, appreciated that he called her by her first name when she entered, and never failed to tell her “Take care” when she left. Yet somehow Sanabria knew that Anthony Tucker, who has spent five years in the building, preferred to be called by his last name. “Hey, Tuck,” Sanabria would say, extending his hand for a fist bump. When Tony Chen, who runs a boutique tour company and lives on the seventh floor, limped into the building one morning, addled by plantar fasciitis, Sanabria showed him a foot stretch that helped. On another day, when a tenant showed up at the front door with a large couch to take up to his apartment, even though the building’s rules mandated the use of a side door, Sanabria stood watch to make sure a meddlesome neighbor didn’t wander over.\n\n\n\n[#externallink: \u002Fexternallinks\u002F5e6a8d2525cee1000833d9fd]||||||\n\n“With Juan, you always got the sense that he was more knowledgeable than he let on,” Georgeen Comerford, who has lived in the building for nearly fifty years, told me. A photography professor at *CUNY*{: .small}, she described Sanabria as a “mensch who appreciated the ironies.” He would call her *mámi*, and wink, when she passed through the lobby. It wasn’t just that you were glad to see him, she said. “If you didn’t see him, you wanted to know where he was. When he wasn’t around, you felt it.”\n\nUncharacteristically, Sanabria wasn’t around the last week of February. His eighty-two-year-old mother, with whom he shared an apartment on Ogden Avenue, was suffering from emphysema; he had taken her to a nearby hospital. When word spread in the building that Sanabria’s mother was ill, no one was surprised to learn that he was by her side. “It was who he was,” Jimmy Montalvo, one of the other doormen, told me. Montalvo and Sanabria were neighbors—Montalvo got his job at the building through Sanabria, three years ago—and frequently had breakfast together at their corner bodega; Sanabria was always bringing food back for his mother, Montalvo said. “He took good care of her.” Even when Sanabria was away from 860 Grand Concourse, during a break or on his days off, he gave the impression that he was never far. James Tirado, the youngest and newest doorman on staff, used to get calls and texts from Sanabria, checking up on him. “How’s the day going?” Sanabria would ask. “Is everything going O.K. for you?”\n\nBy the time his mother’s health had improved, and Sanabria returned to work, on March 3rd, he was beginning to feel ill himself. There were still very few publicly known *COVID*{: .small}\\-19 cases in New York City, and his symptoms—dizziness and fatigue—were not yet widely associated with the disease. He wasn’t coughing, and he didn’t have a fever. He went home anyway, to rest for a few days. On Monday, March 9th, his day off, he returned to 860 Grand Concourse, to consult with a doctor on the first floor—his “doctor friend,” he called him. He was feeling worse, and had developed a cough. Tirado noticed him wheezing as he passed the doorman’s post.\n\nWhile he waited for the doctor, Sanabria called one of his stepdaughters, Walkiris Cruz-Perez, a nurse at Columbia-Presbyterian. She was in the Dominican Republic at the time, getting dental work done, but she was concerned enough to call him an ambulance. “He would never call one for himself,” she said. “But I made him promise me one thing. I said to him, ‘Go to Columbia. Go to *my* hospital. Don’t go to Lincoln.’&nbsp;” She was referring to the Bronx hospital where Sanabria was born, and which he held in almost superstitiously high esteem. Lincoln was where he had taken his mother a week earlier, and where one of his best friends had died, a few years before. He’d even considered applying for a part-time job there as a security guard.\n\nIt took about twenty minutes for the ambulance to arrive and for the orderlies to load him into the back. Not yet feverish, he insisted—in his usual, stoic way—that he was feeling just fine. What was most telling, though, was the fact that he did not object to being taken to the hospital; almost compulsively protective of others, he was finally ceding control to someone else, which struck Walkiris as worrisome. She talked him through the situation on FaceTime, as Tirado watched from the door. It would be the last time anyone from the building saw Sanabria.\n\n-=-=-=-\nIn the days after Sanabria’s death, his former tenants and co-workers staggered between shock and grief. Contributing to the over-all sense of loss was their collective realization that, while they each felt close to him, most of them actually knew little about him. Montalvo, for instance, was vaguely aware that Sanabria had served in the military, yet he never learned any of the details. One tenant in the building, a thirty-eight-year-old nurse and Navy reservist named Frankie Hamilton, knew about Sanabria’s time in the Navy because they swapped stories about training at a facility near Throgs Neck, in the Bronx. But he didn’t know anything about Sanabria’s family. Another tenant told me, “I kept hearing that he had a daughter who was a nurse, but also that his daughter was a cop. Which was it?”\n\nHe had two stepdaughters, actually—a nurse *and* an N.Y.P.D. officer. He spoke about each of them constantly, with an unabashed and even grandiloquent sense of pride. Yet he shared stories about them in different ways to different people. Julia Donahue-Wait, a registered nurse herself, knew all about Walkiris’s career. But she would be at work during the day, when Sanabria’s other stepdaughter, Waleska, often dropped in to meet him for lunch. Waleska’s precinct, the Forty-fourth, includes the stretch of Grand Concourse where Sanabria worked. Several times a week, they went to a deli down the street and ate in his break room at the building. “When I didn’t have time, we would stand at the front door and talk about my son,” Waleska told me. Their conversations revolved around three things, she said: her child, her mother, and her work. “He loved that I was a cop. He was always telling me about things that would happen around the neighborhood.”\n\nSanabria, the son of Puerto Rican parents, grew up near the old Yankee Stadium, in the Bronx. After high school, he joined the Navy, where he served for the next twenty years. Travelling was an obsession of his—in the service, he spent time in the Philippines and the Bahamas—but he also loved structure and a sense of routine. “I used to say to him, ‘Juan, you’re just weird\\!’&nbsp;” Mimi Roman, his oldest friend, told me. (The two of them were born on the same day: August 13, 1967.) “He had to have everything in order. He’d always have his way of doing things.” After he was given a diagnosis of celiac disease, a digestive disorder that rendered him allergic to gluten, he adjusted his diet and stuck to it. “It was always everything in moderation,” Roman said.\n\nIn his mid-thirties, Sanabria retired from the military and returned home, finding a job as a janitor at a local elementary school. The youngest of four children, he was fanatically devoted to his parents; he worked overtime so that they’d have money to take vacations. In 2003, looking for an additional source of income, he began working part time at 860 Grand Concourse, covering odd shifts and filling in for the other doormen when they were sick or on vacation. He was perfectly suited for a job that rewarded dependability and charm. Unflaggingly serious about work, he also had a mischievous side, playing practical jokes and making people laugh. “He had goals in life,” Roman said. “He wanted to achieve things. He didn’t want to ever be stuck. He knew all about his surroundings. He was up on things. I used to call him ‘the news’ because he always knew what was going on.”\n\nHe met Raquel Ramos, his partner of eleven years, at a dominoes game across the street from his apartment. She was Dominican, and nine years his senior; she had two daughters, two sons, and three grandchildren, whom Sanabria immediately treated like family. I asked Waleska if it took time for her, her sister, and their children to respond in kind. “Not at all,” she said. “He was a great guy, and we saw how much he loved our mother.” When Waleska got married, he was there, presiding just as any father would, and when, in 2014, she got a divorce, he helped her find and pay for a lawyer. “He was the only one who helped me with that,” she said. “He was the type of man I’d want my son to become. The type of person I would love for my nieces to marry.”\n\nHe also grew close to Walkiris’s two daughters, who used to stay with their grandmother while Walkiris was at nursing school and, later, at the hospital. Sanabria was almost always there. After leaving 860 Grand Concourse, he’d stop off at his apartment to give his mother dinner, then travel to Washington Heights to be with the rest of his family. Walkiris’s younger daughter, Emeli, who’s now thirteen, came to expect a text message from him every day at three-thirty, just as she was leaving school, to make sure she was coming over for dinner. “His life was my mom, his mom, his grandchildren, and his job,” Walkiris told me.\n\n-=-=-=-\nA few hours after calling the ambulance for Sanabria, Walkiris checked in with him on FaceTime. He was in a hospital bed, but she didn’t recognize the walls and surroundings behind him. “Juan, I’m going to kick your ass\\!” she said. It wasn’t that she had any particular reason to distrust the care he would receive at Lincoln Hospital, as opposed to Columbia-Presbyterian; she just wanted him to be at the facility she knew, the place in which she had the greatest faith. “I was born here,” he replied. “Anyway, I just have a cough. You’re making too much of this.” She told him, “Your face is red. You clearly have a fever. This is serious.”\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F5e8fa604d2568400081f30f5]\n\n+++\n\nA doctor in a hazmat suit entered the room and asked for Sanabria’s phone so he could speak to Walkiris outside. The test results hadn’t come back yet, he told her, but Sanabria’s symptoms, including the images of his lungs taken from a CT scan, matched the profile of *COVID*{: .small}\\-19, based on documented cases out of Wuhan, in China. Walkiris flew home that afternoon, and went straight to the hospital. When she arrived, with her suitcases in tow, Sanabria was in quarantine.\n\nSix years ago, Sanabria had asked Walkiris to be his health-care proxy. He was forty-six at the time, and in good health. She never understood why he raised the issue with her. But he insisted—“I know you’ll take good care of me,” he said—and she agreed. As a result, she was legally allowed to enter his room at Lincoln Hospital, though doing so would have been extremely dangerous under the circumstances. That Monday night, she spoke to him from outside his door, again on FaceTime, and they agreed that she would go home and return in the morning. By then, he had full-fledged pneumonia, and was getting oxygen through a tube inserted in his nose. His face had flushed to a deep red.\n\nAt eight o’clock the next morning, the doctor called Walkiris and asked her to help persuade Sanabria to be intubated. He’d deteriorated overnight, and now needed to be on a respirator. “Am I going to die?” Sanabria asked Walkiris. “No, *pápi*,” she told him. “They’re going to put you to sleep for a little while, so you can relax your lungs. You’re breathing too fast.” He seemed dazed. “I don’t feel sick,” he said calmly. “Will you be here when I wake up?”\n\n“I’ll see you on the other side,” she replied. “Let them do this.” As the nurses prepared to intubate him, he bragged about how his daughter was a nurse. Just before he went under, he sent Walkiris one last selfie.\n\nBy March 10th, Mayor Bill de Blasio had announced thirty-six confirmed *COVID*{: .small}\\-19 cases in New York City. It isn’t clear whether Sanabria was counted among them. Most likely, he wasn’t yet. It would be another four days before the first deaths in the city were made public. The patients were elderly—one was eighty-two, another seventy-nine—and they had underlying medical conditions. It seemed inconceivable that Sanabria would suffer a similar fate.\n\n+++feature-default\n\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5e83bde9ba0e6f0009421c7e]\n\n+++\n{: legacyType=\"feature-small\"}\n\nWalkiris returned to the hospital around six that evening. The thought of Sanabria lying alone in the intensive-care unit had grown intolerable, and she was determined to see him, despite the risk of getting infected herself. “I figured I’d already been in contact with the virus anyway,” she said. “I may as well be exposed to family.” She approached his room, but a doctor, who had introduced herself as Dr.&nbsp;K., intercepted her. Walkiris was crying, and pleaded to be allowed inside. Dr. K. held her firmly by the arms, and told her to close her eyes. “I want you to visualize a conversation I’m going to have right now with your father,” the doctor told her. “Imagine I’m walking into his room as his doctor, and asking him if he would feel comfortable with you coming in to see him. I’m telling him about the risks to you and your family if you went in there. What would he say? Would he want you to say goodbye to his spirit in there, or out here?” Walkiris told me later that, in that moment, the doctor may have saved her life.\n\nThe reality fully set in on Thursday, March 12th, when a colleague invited her to join a private Facebook group of doctors and nurses at Columbia-Presbyterian. One of the doctors had shared a chart detailing the progression of fatal *COVID*{: .small}\\-19 cases. Patients who eventually died from the disease entered the emergency room with normal heart function, then suffered total respiratory failure. Under typical circumstances, such a failure would coincide with sepsis or shock, but that wasn’t the case for many with *COVID*{: .small}\\-19. These patients might appear to stabilize and even to improve. Yet within hours their condition would deteriorate once more, this time irreparably, and their heart function would swiftly decline. “It was his presentation exactly,” Walkiris said. “I can’t even explain it to you. That’s when I really knew. All I could do was cry.”\n\nThe next day, Juan’s blood pressure dropped precipitately. Walkiris’s sister and mother tried to visit him in the hospital, too, but were turned away. They told Walkiris to pray. “I kept telling them, ‘Look at this chart. He doesn’t even have a few days,’&nbsp;” Walkiris said. “My family didn’t want to hear it.” He never regained consciousness after being intubated; by the time he died, on March 17th, no one had been able to say goodbye.\n\n-=-=-=-\nThe management company at 860 Grand Concourse sent a notice to the building’s residents later that night. “We have been informed that Juan Sanabria, daytime Doorman has passed away this morning,” it said. “His family informed Management that he tested Positive for Coronavirus.” That was the only reference to him and his family that appeared in the notice; the rest of it listed a new battery of precautions that the building would be implementing—increased frequency of cleaning and daily disinfecting—along with recommendations from the New York City Health Department for how to avoid spreading or contracting the virus. Many of the residents were put off by the impersonal tone, one of them, a journalist named Alice Speri, told me. “I have been thinking about Juan non-stop since he passed,” Speri said. “He was such a regular, happy part of our daily lives. I know that every time I walk through the building’s door I won’t be able to not think about him.”\n\nGeorgeen Comerford was at home when she received the notice. A few days earlier, Jimmy Montalvo had told her that Sanabria was sick. “I thought immediately about the virus,” she told me. One morning, while Sanabria was in the hospital, she went downstairs to ask James Tirado, who was on duty, if he knew more about the situation. “I can’t even talk about it,” he had told her, choking back tears. She began to brace herself for the worst—“It was like you were letting air out of the balloon,” she said—but she was still unprepared for the announcement of his death. “It was a punch in the stomach,” she said.\n\nEarly the next day, Comerford listened to the news on the radio. By then, *CUNY*{: .small} had moved classes online. Isolated in her apartment, she found herself trying to piece together how Sanabria fit into the broader account of what was developing in the city. He’d been among the first fatalities. “Was he the eleventh person who died? I was trying to figure out if he was the tenth or the eleventh,” Comerford told me. “That made this whole thing very real. Before, the deaths were just statistics. Knowing that one of them was Juan, it gave the thing a face.”\n\nAt 860 Grand Concourse, everyone’s anguish is now tinged with fear. A week after Sanabria died, there was another confirmed case of *COVID*{: .small}\\-19 in the building. Montalvo and Tirado were growing uncomfortable working the door, and were trying to scale back their hours without management docking their pay. When we last spoke, at the end of March, Montalvo was in touch with a union representative to figure out whether staying home would count against his sick days. There was money but also safety to consider, he told me. They’d been exposed to Sanabria themselves, and yet, in some ways, that was the least of it. “We have a friend, not just our co-worker, who died, too,” he told me.\n\nMeanwhile, because the cause of death was *COVID*{: .small}\\-19, none of the mortuaries that Walkiris and her family called were willing to pick up Sanabria’s body; his corpse remained in the hospital morgue for nine days before one service finally agreed to help. A funeral was out of the question. All of Sanabria’s family members spent fourteen days in quarantine. The only one of them to show any symptoms was his mother, who had stomach pain and a low-grade fever. She ultimately tested positive for *COVID*{: .small}\\-19, but her symptoms remained mild; she’s since recovered. Waleska went back to work on Sunday, March&nbsp;29th. She had been nervous about returning to her beat—not because of the coronavirus or anything specific about the job. She would have to patrol past 860 Grand Concourse. “And that is where I’ll see him,” she said.\n\nSanabria’s cell phone, which the hospital gave to Walkiris, was full of voice memos and missed calls. Listening to them, Walkiris heard friends of his, most of whom she’d never met, calling him Juanito and Juancho. “Everyone had a distinctive thing,” she said. She realized that he’d been as reliable and routine-oriented with his friends as he’d always been with his family; people were calling because he used to check up on them regularly, and, when they hadn’t heard from him, they worried that something was wrong. Eventually, Walkiris signed on to his Facebook account to post the news. “Juan Sanabria passed away due to coronavirus,” she wrote. “My dad was a loving man who was a respected son, father, and grandfather. Please in light of what is going on in the world please tell your loved ones how much you love them. Once the city allows us to have a service in his name I will make sure to let everyone know.”&nbsp;♦\n\n***\n## A Guide to the Coronavirus\n- How to practice [social

One of them leads up to the offices of a dentist and a lawyer, who, along with several physicians, rent commercial space. The other goes down past two pairs of gold-painted columns and into the main lobby, where an elevator services seven floors with a hundred and eleven apartments. Tuesday through Saturday, between eight in the morning and five in the evening, tenants going down to or coming up from the lobby could expect a greeting from a trim, punctilious man with close-cropped hair. He wore a navy-blue uniform that hung loosely off his narrow shoulders. His name was Juan Sanabria."],["cm-unit"],["native-ad",{"position":"in-content","shouldDisplayLabel":false}],["p","There was an art to Sanabria’s salutations. Dana Frishkorn, who’s lived in the building for three and a half years, appreciated that he called her by her first name when she entered, and never failed to tell her “Take care” when she left. Yet somehow Sanabria knew that Anthony Tucker, who has spent five years in the building, preferred to be called by his last name. “Hey, Tuck,” Sanabria would say, extending his hand for a fist bump. When Tony Chen, who runs a boutique tour company and lives on the seventh floor, limped into the building one morning, addled by plantar fasciitis, Sanabria showed him a foot stretch that helped. On another day, when a tenant showed up at the front door with a large couch to take up to his apartment, even though the building’s rules mandated the use of a side door, Sanabria stood watch to make sure a meddlesome neighbor didn’t wander over."],["inline-embed",{"props":{"dangerousDek":"","dangerousHed":"\u003Cem\u003EThe New Yorker’s\u003C\u002Fem\u003E coronavirus news coverage and analysis are free for all readers.","rubric":"","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fcoronavirus"},"ref":"5e6a8d2525cee1000833d9fd","type":"externallink"}],["p","“With Juan, you always got the sense that he was more knowledgeable than he let on,” Georgeen Comerford, who has lived in the building for nearly fifty years, told me. A photography professor at ",["em",{"class":"small"},"CUNY"],", she described Sanabria as a “mensch who appreciated the ironies.” He would call her ",["em","mámi"],", and wink, when she passed through the lobby. It wasn’t just that you were glad to see him, she said. “If you didn’t see him, you wanted to know where he was. When he wasn’t around, you felt it.”"],["p","Uncharacteristically, Sanabria wasn’t around the last week of February. His eighty-two-year-old mother, with whom he shared an apartment on Ogden Avenue, was suffering from emphysema; he had taken her to a nearby hospital. When word spread in the building that Sanabria’s mother was ill, no one was surprised to learn that he was by her side. “It was who he was,” Jimmy Montalvo, one of the other doormen, told me. Montalvo and Sanabria were neighbors—Montalvo got his job at the building through Sanabria, three years ago—and frequently had breakfast together at their corner bodega; Sanabria was always bringing food back for his mother, Montalvo said. “He took good care of her.” Even when Sanabria was away from 860 Grand Concourse, during a break or on his days off, he gave the impression that he was never far. James Tirado, the youngest and newest doorman on staff, used to get calls and texts from Sanabria, checking up on him. “How’s the day going?” Sanabria would ask. “Is everything going O.K. for you?”"],["p","By the time his mother’s health had improved, and Sanabria returned to work, on March 3rd, he was beginning to feel ill himself. There were still very few publicly known ",["em",{"class":"small"},"COVID"],"-19 cases in New York City, and his symptoms—dizziness and fatigue—were not yet widely associated with the disease. He wasn’t coughing, and he didn’t have a fever. He went home anyway, to rest for a few days. On Monday, March 9th, his day off, he returned to 860 Grand Concourse, to consult with a doctor on the first floor—his “doctor friend,” he called him. He was feeling worse, and had developed a cough. Tirado noticed him wheezing as he passed the doorman’s post."],["p","While he waited for the doctor, Sanabria called one of his stepdaughters, Walkiris Cruz-Perez, a nurse at Columbia-Presbyterian. She was in the Dominican Republic at the time, getting dental work done, but she was concerned enough to call him an ambulance. “He would never call one for himself,” she said. “But I made him promise me one thing. I said to him, ‘Go to Columbia. Go to ",["em","my"]," hospital. Don’t go to Lincoln.’ ” She was referring to the Bronx hospital where Sanabria was born, and which he held in almost superstitiously high esteem. Lincoln was where he had taken his mother a week earlier, and where one of his best friends had died, a few years before. He’d even considered applying for a part-time job there as a security guard."],["p","It took about twenty minutes for the ambulance to arrive and for the orderlies to load him into the back. Not yet feverish, he insisted—in his usual, stoic way—that he was feeling just fine. What was most telling, though, was the fact that he did not object to being taken to the hospital; almost compulsively protective of others, he was finally ceding control to someone else, which struck Walkiris as worrisome. She talked him through the situation on FaceTime, as Tirado watched from the door. It would be the last time anyone from the building saw Sanabria."],["p",{"class":"has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading"},"In the days after Sanabria’s death, his former tenants and co-workers staggered between shock and grief. Contributing to the over-all sense of loss was their collective realization that, while they each felt close to him, most of them actually knew little about him. Montalvo, for instance, was vaguely aware that Sanabria had served in the military, yet he never learned any of the details. One tenant in the building, a thirty-eight-year-old nurse and Navy reservist named Frankie Hamilton, knew about Sanabria’s time in the Navy because they swapped stories about training at a facility near Throgs Neck, in the Bronx. But he didn’t know anything about Sanabria’s family. Another tenant told me, “I kept hearing that he had a daughter who was a nurse, but also that his daughter was a cop. Which was it?”"],["p","He had two stepdaughters, actually—a nurse ",["em","and"]," an N.Y.P.D. officer. He spoke about each of them constantly, with an unabashed and even grandiloquent sense of pride. Yet he shared stories about them in different ways to different people. Julia Donahue-Wait, a registered nurse herself, knew all about Walkiris’s career. But she would be at work during the day, when Sanabria’s other stepdaughter, Waleska, often dropped in to meet him for lunch. Waleska’s precinct, the Forty-fourth, includes the stretch of Grand Concourse where Sanabria worked. Several times a week, they went to a deli down the street and ate in his break room at the building. “When I didn’t have time, we would stand at the front door and talk about my son,” Waleska told me. Their conversations revolved around three things, she said: her child, her mother, and her work. “He loved that I was a cop. He was always telling me about things that would happen around the neighborhood.”"],["ad",{"position":"mid-content"}],["p","Sanabria, the son of Puerto Rican parents, grew up near the old Yankee Stadium, in the Bronx. After high school, he joined the Navy, where he served for the next twenty years. Travelling was an obsession of his—in the service, he spent time in the Philippines and the Bahamas—but he also loved structure and a sense of routine. “I used to say to him, ‘Juan, you’re just weird!’ ” Mimi Roman, his oldest friend, told me. (The two of them were born on the same day: August 13, 1967.) “He had to have everything in order. He’d always have his way of doing things.” After he was given a diagnosis of celiac disease, a digestive disorder that rendered him allergic to gluten, he adjusted his diet and stuck to it. “It was always everything in moderation,” Roman said."],["p","In his mid-thirties, Sanabria retired from the military and returned home, finding a job as a janitor at a local elementary school. The youngest of four children, he was fanatically devoted to his parents; he worked overtime so that they’d have money to take vacations. In 2003, looking for an additional source of income, he began working part time at 860 Grand Concourse, covering odd shifts and filling in for the other doormen when they were sick or on vacation. He was perfectly suited for a job that rewarded dependability and charm. Unflaggingly serious about work, he also had a mischievous side, playing practical jokes and making people laugh. “He had goals in life,” Roman said. “He wanted to achieve things. He didn’t want to ever be stuck. He knew all about his surroundings. He was up on things. I used to call him ‘the news’ because he always knew what was going on.”"],["p","He met Raquel Ramos, his partner of eleven years, at a dominoes game across the street from his apartment. She was Dominican, and nine years his senior; she had two daughters, two sons, and three grandchildren, whom Sanabria immediately treated like family. I asked Waleska if it took time for her, her sister, and their children to respond in kind. “Not at all,” she said. “He was a great guy, and we saw how much he loved our mother.” When Waleska got married, he was there, presiding just as any father would, and when, in 2014, she got a divorce, he helped her find and pay for a lawyer. “He was the only one who helped me with that,” she said. “He was the type of man I’d want my son to become. The type of person I would love for my nieces to marry.”"],["p","He also grew close to Walkiris’s two daughters, who used to stay with their grandmother while Walkiris was at nursing school and, later, at the hospital. Sanabria was almost always there. After leaving 860 Grand Concourse, he’d stop off at his apartment to give his mother dinner, then travel to Washington Heights to be with the rest of his family. Walkiris’s younger daughter, Emeli, who’s now thirteen, came to expect a text message from him every day at three-thirty, just as she was leaving school, to make sure she was coming over for dinner. “His life was my mom, his mom, his grandchildren, and his job,” Walkiris told me."],["inline-embed",{"type":"cneinterlude","props":{"brand":"newyorker","embeddedVideos":[],"hasExcludedEmbed":false,"playerBase":"https:\u002F\u002Fplayer.cnevids.com","isRightRail":false}}],["p",{"class":"has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading"},"A few hours after calling the ambulance for Sanabria, Walkiris checked in with him on FaceTime. He was in a hospital bed, but she didn’t recognize the walls and surroundings behind him. “Juan, I’m going to kick your ass!” she said. It wasn’t that she had any particular reason to distrust the care he would receive at Lincoln Hospital, as opposed to Columbia-Presbyterian; she just wanted him to be at the facility she knew, the place in which she had the greatest faith. “I was born here,” he replied. “Anyway, I just have a cough. You’re making too much of this.” She told him, “Your face is red. You clearly have a fever.

Walkiris was crying, and pleaded to be allowed inside. Dr. K. held her firmly by the arms, and told her to close her eyes. “I want you to visualize a conversation I’m going to have right now with your father,” the doctor told her. “Imagine I’m walking into his room as his doctor, and asking him if he would feel comfortable with you coming in to see him.

He’d been among the first fatalities. “Was he the eleventh person who died? I was trying to figure out if he was the tenth or the eleventh,” Comerford told me. “That made this whole thing very real. Before, the deaths were just statistics. Knowing that one of them was Juan, it gave the thing a face.”"],["p","At 860 Grand Concourse, everyone’s anguish is now tinged with fear.

A funeral was out of the question. All of Sanabria’s family members spent fourteen days in quarantine. The only one of them to show any symptoms was his mother, who had stomach pain and a low-grade fever. She ultimately tested positive for ",["em",{"class":"small"},"COVID"],"-19, but her symptoms remained mild; she’s since recovered. Waleska went back to work on Sunday, March 29th.

She realized that he’d been as reliable and routine-oriented with his friends as he’d always been with his family; people were calling because he used to check up on them regularly, and, when they hadn’t heard from him, they worried that something was wrong. Eventually, Walkiris signed on to his Facebook account to post the news. “Juan Sanabria passed away due to coronavirus,” she wrote. “My dad was a loving man who was a respected son, father, and grandfather. Please in light of what is going on in the world please tell your loved ones how much you love them.

inequality, housing insecurity, debt accumulation, and health care continues, now against the grim backdrop of the raging [coronavirus](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fcoronavirus). It is difficult to articulate the speed with which the U.S. and, indeed, the world, has descended into an existential crisis. We are experiencing an unprecedented public-health event whose diminution and potential resolution rests with a series of prescriptions, including settlement-in-place orders, that will annihilate the economy. The deadly spread of *COVID*{: .small}-19 demands enclosure as a way to starve the searching virus of bodies to inhabit. The consequences of doing so removes workers from work and consumers from consumption; no economy can operate under these conditions. \n\nAmerican life has been suddenly and dramatically upended, and, when things are turned upside down, the bottom is brought to the surface and exposed to the light. In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath ravaged the Gulf Coast, it, too, provided a deeper look into the darkness of U.S. inequality. As the actor Danny Glover [said](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.fyicomminc.com\u002Fgaianews\u002Fkatrinawords.htm) then, “When the hurricane struck the Gulf and the floodwaters rose and tore through New Orleans, plunging its remaining population into a carnival of misery, it did not turn the region into a Third World country, as it has been disparagingly implied in the media; it revealed one. It revealed the disaster within the disaster; gruelling poverty rose to the surface like a bruise to our skin.”\n\nFor years, the United States has gotten away with persistently chipping away at its weak welfare state by hiding or demonizing the populations most dependent on it. The poor are relegated as socially dysfunctional and inept, unable to cash in on the riches of American society. There are more than forty million poor people in the U.S., but they almost never merit a mention. While black poverty is presented as exemplary, white poverty is obscured, and Latinos and other brown people’s experiences are ignored. As many as four in five Americans [say](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.usnews.com\u002Fnews\u002Fthe-report\u002Farticles\u002F2019-01-11\u002Fstretched-thin-majority-of-americans-live-paycheck-to-paycheck) they live paycheck to paycheck. Forty per cent of Americans [say](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.federalreserve.gov\u002Fnewsevents\u002Fpressreleases\u002Fother20170519a.htm) that they cannot cover an unexpected four-hundred-dollar emergency expense. \n\n[#externallink: \u002Fexternallinks\u002F5e6a8d2525cee1000833d9fd]|||\n\nThis is a virus that will thrive in the intimacy of American poverty. For years now, even in the midst of the economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, rising rents and stagnant salaries and wages have forced millions of families to improvise housing; nearly four million households live in [overcrowded](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.urban.org\u002Furban-wire\u002Famericas-housing-getting-more-crowded-how-will-affect-children) homes. This is the cruel irony of the San Francisco Bay Area’s shelter-in-place mandate: the region is at the epicenter of the U.S. housing crisis, as exemplified by its growing [unsheltered homeless](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fcalifornia-chronicles\u002Fthe-coronavirus-spurs-a-movement-of-people-reclaiming-vacant-homes) population. How do you practice [social isolation](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fdispatch\u002Fhow-do-you-shelter-in-place-when-you-dont-have-a-home) without privacy or personal space? There are the crowded public offices that poor people congregate in to navigate access to services and income. There are the emergency rooms that function as primary health-care providers—not to mention the county jails and state prisons. \n\nEconomic inequality is exacerbated by racial injustice, both held in place by a threadbare social-safety net. Black and brown populations are particularly vulnerable to infection because poverty is a fount of underlying conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary disease, and heart disease, that make it more likely that the virus will be deadly. They are also more vulnerable because greater rates of poverty and under-employment have hindered access to health care. In Milwaukee, the most segregated city in the U.S., where black unemployment is four times the rate of white unemployment, the [majority](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.jsonline.com\u002Fstory\u002Fnews\u002Flocal\u002Fmilwaukee\u002F2020\u002F03\u002F24\u002Fmilwaukee-coronavirus-cases-majority-middle-aged-african-american-men\u002F2904634001\u002F) of diagnosed coronavirus cases are middle-aged black men. And as anyone who has ever had to wonder how they will make their rent payment knows, the stress of economic uncertainty is corrosive, eating into the capability of the immune system.  \n\nBut the danger of contracting the coronavirus will hardly be the problem of the poor and working class alone. Those who, because of poverty and insecurity, are most vulnerable to infection also have disproportionate contact with the broader public, through their low-wage retail and service work. Consider the plight of the home health-care worker. Millions of such workers attend to a largely elderly and homebound population for meagre hourly wages and often without health insurance. In 2018, home [health-care workers](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cnbc.com\u002F2019\u002F04\u002F09\u002Fus-home-healthcare-system-is-in-crisis-as-worker-shortages-worsen.html), eighty-seven per cent of whom are women and sixty per cent of whom are black or Latino, made an average of about eleven dollars and fifty cents an hour. These workers are the sinews of our society: they *must* work to insure that our society continues to function, even as that work poses potential threats to their clients and the general public. Their insecurity, combined with the failure of meaningful action by the federal government, will make the suppression of the virus nearly impossible. \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThus far, the [Trump Administration](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fdonald-trump) has predictably bungled the response to the coronavirus. But the Democratic Party’s response has been hampered by its shared hostility to unleashing the power of the state, through the advance of vast universal programs, to attend to an unprecedented, devolving catastrophe. About half of American workers receive health insurance through their employer. As job losses mount, millions of workers will lose their insurance while the public-health crisis surges. In the last Democratic debate, former [Vice-President Joe Biden](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fjoe-biden) insisted that the U.S. doesn’t need single-payer health care because the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in Italy proved that it doesn’t work. Strangely, he simultaneously insisted that all testing and treatment of the virus should be free because we are in crisis. This insistence that health care should only be free in an emergency reveals a profound ignorance about the ways that preventive medicine can mitigate the harshest effects of an acute infection. By mid-February, a Chinese government study of that country’s coronavirus-related deaths found that those with preëxisting conditions accounted for at least a third of all *COVID*{: .small}-19 fatalities.  \n\nDismissing the necessity of universal health care also shows an obliviousness to the power of medical expenses to alter the course of one’s life. Two-thirds of Americans who file for bankruptcy say that medical debt or losing work while they were sick contributed to their need to do so. The costs of medical treatment become a reason for postponing visits to the doctor. A 2018 poll found that forty-four per cent of Americans [delayed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.westhealth.org\u002Fpress-release\u002Fsurvey2018\u002F) seeing a doctor due to its cost. Already, half of Americans polled have said that they worry about the costs of the testing and treatment of *COVID*{: .small}-19\\. In a situation like the one we are in, it becomes easy to see the ways that encumbered access to health care exacerbates a public-health breakdown. [N.B.A. players, celebrities](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fculture\u002Fcultural-comment\u002Ffrom-steph-curry-to-madonna-celebrity-in-the-age-of-the-coronavirus), and the wealthy have access to the coronavirus test, but attending nurses and frontline health-care workers, community health centers, and public hospitals do not. Health-care inequalities are problems that have been left unattended, creating so many small, imperceptible fractures that, in the midst of a full-scale crisis, the structure is collapsing, shattering under its own weight. \n\nThe case has never been clearer for a transition to Medicare for All, but its achievement clashes with the Democratic Party’s decades-long hostility to funding the social-welfare state. At the heart of this resistance is the pernicious glorification of “personal responsibility,” through which success or failure in life is seen as an expression of personal fortitude or personal laxity. The American Dream, we are told, is anchored in the promise of unfettered social mobility, a destiny driven by self-determination and perseverance. This ingrained thinking evades the fact that it was the New Deal, in the nineteen-thirties, and the G.I. Bill, in the nineteen-forties, that, through a combination of federal work programs, subsidies, and government-backed guarantees, created a middle-class life style for millions of white Americans. In the nineteen-sixties, as a result of prolonged black protest, Lyndon Johnson authored the War on Poverty and other Great Society programs, which were intended to lessen the impact of decades of racial discrimination in jobs, housing, and education. By 1969, with Richard Nixon at the helm, during an economic downturn that ended what was then the longest economic expansion in American history, the conservatives attacked the notion of the “social contract” embedded in all of these programs, claiming that they rewarded laziness and were evidence of special rights for some. When Nixon ran for reëlection, in 1972, he claimed that his campaign pitted the “work ethic” against the “welfare ethic.” \n\nThis was an attack not only on public aid and subsidized housing but also on the people using those programs. Republicans successfully tapped into the racial resentments of white suburbanites, who decried “their” tax dollars going to unruly, rioting African-Americans. They resented “forced integration,” “forced busing,” and “the bureaucrats,” as Nixon derisively called the previous Democratic Administrations. It is important to understand that this was not demonization for its own sake or because of some irrational antipathy toward African-Americans. This was about keeping the corporate tax rate low and reëstablishing the profitability of capital in the aftermath of  another, longer economic downturn. It is hard for businesses and their political representatives to counsel ordinary workers to do more with less. It was easier to blame welfare queens, welfare cheats, and an oblique, yet black, underclass for the end of these “wasteful” programs. In 1973, Nixon unceremoniously declared an end to the “urban crisis”—the catalyst for much of Johnson’s welfare state. This created the pretext for his gutting of the Office of Economic Opportunity, the office that managed the web of anti-poverty programs created by the War on Poverty.\n\nThe eventual defection of ordinary white voters from the Democratic Party to the Republicans meant that the Democrats soon aped the right’s strategy of downplaying the structural roots of inequality while portraying black communities as ultimately responsible for their own hardships. By the end of the nineteen-eighties, the Democratic Party was championing law-and-order politics and harsh, racist attacks on welfare entitlements. In a 1988 column for the *Post* of Newark, Delaware, titled “Welfare System About to Change,” the then Senator Biden [wrote](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.thedailybeast.com\u002Fwhen-joe-biden-worried-about-welfare-mothers-driving-luxury-cars), “We are all too familiar with the stories of welfare mothers driving luxury cars and leading lifestyles that mirror the rich and famous. Whether they are exaggerated or not, these stories underlie a broad social concern that the welfare system has broken down—that it only parcels out welfare checks and does nothing to help the poor find productive jobs.” This statement was hardly extraordinary; it reflected widespread efforts to transform public perceptions of the Democratic Party. By the early nineties, President Bill Clinton was promising to “end welfare as we know it,” which he succeeded in doing by the end of the decade. \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThis is the historical backdrop to the hypocrisy of U.S. government-spending priorities today. Bipartisan denunciations of big government do not apply to the obscene amounts spent on the military or the maintenance of the nation’s criminal-justice system. The U.S., across all levels of government, spends more than eighty billion dollars annually to operate jails and prisons and to maintain probation and parole. The budget for the U.S. armed forces topped out at a stunning seven hundred and thirty-eight billion dollars for this year alone—more than the next seven largest military budgets in the world.  Meanwhile, social-welfare programs—from food stamps to Medicaid, to subsidized and assisted housing, to public schools—are forced to provide on the thinnest margin, triaging crises, rather than actually pulling people out of poverty.\n\nWhen [Bernie Sanders’s](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fbernie-sanders) critics mocked his platform as  just a bunch of “free stuff,” they were drawing on the past forty years of bipartisan consensus about social-welfare benefits and entitlements. They have argued, instead, that competition organized through the market insures more choices and better quality. In fact, the surreality of market logic was on clear display when, on March 13th, Donald Trump held a press conference to discuss the *COVID*{: .small}-19 crisis with executives from Walgreens, Target, Walmart, and CVS, and a host of laboratory, research, and medical-device corporations. There were no social-service providers or educators there to discuss the immediate, overwhelming needs of the public.  \n\nThe crisis is laying bare the brutality of an economy organized around production for the sake of profit and not human need. The logic that the free market knows best can be seen in the prioritization of affordability in health care as millions careen toward economic ruin. It is seen in the ways that states have been thrown into frantic competition with one another for personal protective equipment and ventilators—the equipment goes to whichever state can pay the most. It can be seen in the still criminally slow and inefficient and inconsistent testing for the virus. It is found in the multi-billion-dollar bailout of the airline industry, alongside nickel-and-dime means tests to determine which people might be eligible to receive ridiculously inadequate public assistance. \n\nThe argument for resuming a viable social-welfare state is about not only attending to the immediate needs of tens of millions of people but also reëstablishing social connectivity, collective responsibility, and a sense of common purpose, if not common wealth. In an unrelenting and unemotional way, *COVID*{: .small}-19 is demonstrating the vastness of our human connection and mutuality. Our collectivity must be borne out in public policies that repair the friable welfare infrastructure that threatens to collapse beneath our social weight. A society that allows hundreds of thousands of home health-care workers to labor without health insurance, that keeps school buildings open so that black and brown children can eat and be sheltered, that allows millionaires to stow their wealth in empty apartments while homeless families navigate the streets, that threatens eviction and loan defaults while hundreds of millions are mandated to stay inside to suppress the virus, is bewildering in its incoherence and inhumanity. \n\nNaomi Klein has written about how the political class has used social catastrophes to create policies that allow for private plunder. She calls it “disaster capitalism,” or the “[shock doctrine](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FShock-Doctrine-Rise-Disaster-Capitalism\u002Fdp\u002F0312427999).” But she has also written that, in each of these moments, there are also opportunities for ordinary people to transform their conditions in ways that benefit humanity. The class-driven hierarchy of our society will encourage the spread of this virus unless dramatic and previously unthinkable solutions are immediately put on the table. As Sanders has counselled, we must think in unprecedented ways. This includes universal health care, an indefinite moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, the cancellation of student-loan debt, a universal basic income, and the reversal of all cuts to food stamps. These are the basic measures that can staunch the immediate crisis of deprivation—of millions of layoffs and millions more to come.  \n\nThe Sanders campaign was an entry point to this discussion. It has shown public appetite, even desire, for vast spending and new programs. These desires did not translate into votes because they seemed like a risky endeavor when the consequence was four more years of Trump. But the mushrooming crisis of *COVID*{: .small}-19 is changing the calculus. As federal officials announce new trillion-dollar aid packages daily, we can never go back to banal discussions of “How will we pay for it?” How can we not? Now is a moment to remake our society anew. \n\n----------\n##A Guide to the Coronavirus  \n- How to practice [social distancing](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fq-and-a\u002Fthe-vital-importance-of-isolation?itm_content=footer-recirc), from responding to a sick housemate to the pros and cons of ordering food.  \n- How people cope and [create new customs](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Four-columnists\u002Fcoping-camaraderie-and-human-evolution-amid-the-coronavirus-crisis?itm_content=footer-recirc) amid a pandemic.   \n- What it means to [contain and mitigate](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnews-desk\u002Fwhat-it-means-to-contain-and-mitigate-the-coronavirus?itm_content=footer-recirc) the coronavirus outbreak.  \n- How much of the world is [likely to be quarantined](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Four-columnists\u002Fhow-much-of-the-world-will-be-quarantined-by-the-coronavirus?itm_content=footer-recirc)?  \n- Donald Trump in [the time of coronavirus](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fdaily-comment\u002Ftrump-in-the-time-of-the-coronavirus?itm_content=footer-recirc).  \n- The coronavirus is [likely to spread for more than a year](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnews-desk\u002Fhow-long-will-it-take-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine?itm_content=footer-recirc) before a vaccine could be widely available.  \n- We are all [irrational panic shoppers](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fculture\u002Fannals-of-gastronomy\u002Fwe-are-all-irrational-panic-shoppers?itm_content=footer-recirc).  \n- The strange terror of [watching the coronavirus take Rome](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fdispatch\u002Fthe-strange-terror-of-watching-coronavirus-take-rome?itm_content=footer-recirc).  \n- How pandemics [change history](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fq-and-a\u002Fhow-pandemics-change-history?itm_content=footer-recirc).

There’s no prescribed path for a candidate to trek down, just a set of practices that have evolved over time: the arena rally, the theatre-in-the-round town hall, the flapjack-diner visit, the fancy-dinner fund-raiser, et cetera. On Wednesday, [Joe Biden](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fjoe-biden) did none of those things. Instead, he held a press conference on Zoom. He sent out an e-mail [newsletter](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FRob_Flaherty\u002Fstatus\u002F1242924311981297675). He announced in that newsletter that he was launching a podcast. He [blogged](https:\u002F\u002Fcrooked.com\u002Farticles\u002Fafter-coronavirus-biden\u002F). He hosted a “[happy hour](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FSymoneDSanders\u002Fstatus\u002F1242868421710184448)” “virtual roundtable” focussed on “the issues Young Americans care about.” \n\nThe [coronavirus outbreak](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fcoronavirus) has upended all corners of America, including the Presidential campaign. The timing of the emergency means that it hasn’t exactly interrupted the Democrats’ nominating process—Biden’s [victory](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fcurrent\u002Fbernie-sanderss-electability-argument-falls-apart-in-michigan) over [Bernie Sanders](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fbernie-sanders) in Michigan, on March 10th, pretty much ended the race—but it has, at the moment of Biden’s triumph, resurfaced many of the questions that dogged him from the start of his campaign. Is he up for the enormity of the task before him? Can he find a voice to meet this moment? Can he cut through the sheer amount of noise that [Donald Trump](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fdonald-trump) makes?\n\nAs states and cities began to shut down earlier this month, scientists and doctors began speaking out about what measures were necessary to combat the coronavirus. Lawmakers began debating government measures that could both fund the medical response and account for the devastating economic fallout. Trump began appearing at daily White House press briefings, which have become, day by day, more like campaign rallies. Andrew Cuomo, New York’s governor, has held his own daily briefings, projecting a sleeves-rolled-up-in-a-crisis style of leadership. Many of Biden’s erstwhile opponents have found roles for themselves. Sanders, still running for the Democratic nomination, has, from the vantage of his seat in the Senate, tried to exert [some pressure](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fhandleyzo\u002Fstatus\u002F1242985531119632385) on Washington from the left. His campaign, meanwhile, has made use of its facility with and reach on digital platforms to host all manner of live-stream content for supporters. [Elizabeth Warren](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Felizabeth-warren) has tried to play lefty referee, as well, while Amy Klobuchar has stood up for [election reforms](https:\u002F\u002Fthehill.com\u002Fpolicy\u002Fcybersecurity\u002F489113-democrats-press-stimulus-funding-boost-mail-in-voting) that might be needed if the pandemic is still with us in the fall. Barack Obama, Biden’s old boss, has used his Twitter account to highlight news articles he deems helpful. Many members of the Obama-Biden Administration have been visible online or on television as issue experts. Ron Klain, the longtime Biden aide who managed the White House’s Ebola response in 2014 and 2015, has been [doing](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.stitcher.com\u002Fpodcast\u002Fdr-celine-gounder\u002Fepidemic-with-dr-celine-gounder-and-ronald-klain) a podcast on the coronavirus since late February. \n\nAs all this has been happening, Biden was slow to find his footing. On Wednesday, during his Zoom press conference, he said that it had taken four days for his campaign to set up live-streaming equipment in his rec room. “I wish I were still in the Senate, being able to impact on some of these things, but I am where I am,” he told reporters. “My main focus, believe it or not—it’s not a political focus—is to make sure we handle this crisis well.” This week, Biden spent time speaking about the need for Washington to take care of millennials and Generation Z in its legislative response to the crisis—talk aimed at the demographic that voted overwhelmingly for Sanders in the primaries to date. He’s talked about the need to protect gig workers, and called for forgiving student debt and listening to scientists. Where he’s sounded most assured is when he has touted his experience overseeing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, under Obama. “Implementing this bill is going to take a whole lot of flyspecking, a whole lot of work,” Biden said on Wednesday, referring to the two-trillion-dollar relief package working its way through Congress. “That’s what we had to do when I was in charge of executing the Recovery Act.” But a potential Biden Administration, if it ever comes, is at best ten months away. He’s not in a position to oversee anything. His job now is to cut through.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2020 Election","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2020-election"},{"id":"5c2e1d8f397f5b30646d0724","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Joe Biden","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"joe-biden"},{"id":"5e306853a5be110008e2ea00","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Coronavirus","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"coronavirus"},{"id":"5c2e1d79b75f002c8941e589","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Leadership","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"leadership"},{"id":"5c2e1ffc41c92e2c9b85dcd9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Democratic Primary","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"democratic-primary"}],"sections":[{"id":"5d56db80261a1a0008b126a4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Campaign Chronicles","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"campaign-chronicles"},{"id":"5e6a54911785a2000935d0c4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Coronavirus","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"coronavirus"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a69d2e2e17730741c68c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Eric Lach is a staff writer at The New Yorker.

Richard Pyle, the Associated Press’s Saigon bureau chief, called the press conferences “the longest-playing tragicomedy in Southeast Asia’s theater of the absurd,” which, minus the “Southeast Asia” part, is not a bad description of the scene currently playing out each evening in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, in the White House. We now have the Trump Follies, the nightly briefings at which [President Trump](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fdonald-trump) has lied and bragged, lamented and equivocated, about [the global pandemic](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Ftag\u002Fcoronavirus) that poses an existential threat to his Presidency. Just as the Vietnam briefings became a standard by which the erosion of government credibility could be measured then, historians of the future will consult the record of Trump’s mendacious, misleading press conferences as an example of a tragic failure of leadership at such a critical moment. There will be much material for them; the transcripts from just the first three days of this week run to more than forty thousand words.\n\nSince Trump began making the press conferences a daily ritual, a couple of weeks ago—an eternity in the pandemic era—his more memorable lines are already featuring in political attacks against him. “I don’t take responsibility at all,” Trump insisted, two weeks ago. When asked to assess his own performance, he said, “I’d rate it a ten.” This Wednesday, with members of his coronavirus task force joining him onstage, he added, “We’ve done one hell of a job. Nobody has done the job that we’ve done. And it’s lucky that you have this group here right now for this problem or you wouldn’t even have a country left.” \n\n[#externallink: \u002Fexternallinks\u002F5e6a8d2525cee1000833d9fd]|||\n|||\n\nThe disconnect between Trumpian reality and actual reality has never been on starker display than in the past few days, as the true face of the horror we are facing in the United States has shown itself, in New York City, with overwhelmed morgues and emergency rooms, a governor pleading for ventilators and face masks from the federal government, and heartbreaking first-person accounts reminiscent of the open letters sent from Italy a few weeks back, which warned Americans: this is what is coming for you—don’t make our mistakes. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said that the United States was emerging as the “epicenter” of the global pandemic, which makes the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room the emerging epicenter of the failure to respond to it.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, it seemed as if maybe that would not be the case. Although the Trump Administration had faltered and delayed and denied through the initial stages of the virus, when it raged outside our borders, it looked like it might finally get its act together and take this public-health menace seriously, now that it was hitting in force inside the U.S. Trump declared a national emergency, stepped up testing, and, on March 16th, agreed to his crisis committee’s plan for a fifteen-day countrywide slowdown, in order to “flatten the curve” of the disease’s trajectory. Barely a week into the fifteen days, however, Trump began signalling an abrupt change of course—at just the moment when the disease was accelerating its deadly progress through a wealthy nation that turned out to be surprisingly ill-prepared for it. \n\nThroughout this long, strange March, Trump has often framed the fight against the pandemic in martial terms: a “battle” to be won, a victory to be achieved, a shared sacrifice against “this invisible enemy” which would go on “until we have defeated the virus.” But the Commander-in-Chief did something extraordinary this week: he rebelled against his own clichés, essentially declaring that he no longer wanted to be at war with the virus after all.\n\nOn Sunday, he prefigured this pivot, apparently after watching the Fox News host Steve Hilton complain about the treatment—a shut-down country and a cratered economy—being worse than the disease. “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,” Trump tweeted, shortly before midnight. By the Monday-night edition of the Follies, which are usually scheduled for 5 *P.M.*{: .small} but often not started until later, Trump was repeating this line over and over again. “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,” he said. “We’re not going to let the cure be worse than the problem.” Later, he added, “We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem,” and also, “We can’t let that happen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We can’t let this continue to go on.” America, he said, would be “open for business” soon.\n\nOn Tuesday, which marked a month since a now-infamous tweet in which the President claimed that “the Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA,” Trump was even more specific. He announced that afternoon, on a Fox News special from the White House lawn, that he wanted to get the country reopened and the church pews “packed” by Easter, on April 12th, at just the time when New York and other states were predicted to face the maximum pressure on their overstretched medical facilities. A few hours later, at the nightly press briefing, he was asked about this seemingly arbitrary timetable by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins. \n\n“Who suggested Easter?” Collins asked. “Who suggested that day?” \n \nTrump replied, “I just thought it was a beautiful time. It would be a beautiful time, a beautiful timeline. It’s a great day.”\n \nCollins followed up: “So that wasn’t based on any of the data?”\n \n“I just think it would be a beautiful timeline,” Trump responded.\n\nThis was painfully revealing: the President, under questioning by an independent reporter, was admitting that he wanted to do something with no basis in science. In fact, within minutes, some of the nation’s leading experts on pandemics panned the suggestion as dangerous and ill conceived. By Wednesday, Trump was still talking about an Easter deadline, but only promising a new “recommendation” at that time. “I’m not going to do anything rash or hastily,” he said, which is as close to a reassuring statement from the President as he will ever offer.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump appeared before the cameras just before 5:30 *P.M.*{: .small}, minutes after the *Times* reported that the United States now had more than eighty-one thousand recorded cases of the coronavirus, surpassing China as the world’s No. 1 country in terms of confirmed infections. When asked about the statistic, Trump acted as though this, too, was some sort of an achievement of his to be praised, saying that the high number was “a tribute to our testing.” Despite the day’s grim news, with his Administration reporting a record-high week of unemployment claims, Trump continued his upbeat tone. The world “is going to end up better than ever,” he said, before reading out all the names of the members of the G-20 world leaders with whom he had spoken that morning, listing the provisions of the two-trillion-dollar [emergency-aid package](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Four-columnists\u002Fthe-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-the-two-trillion-dollar-stimulus) that Congress is finalizing, and even reciting the number of gloves that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has sent to individual states. Eventually, he got around to his main point, which is that “we’ve gotta go back to work.” Earlier on Thursday, his Administration had sent a letter to governors, saying it would soon issue new guidelines rating U.S. counties by their varied levels of risk for the disease and suggesting that those with lower risk could resume business more quickly. Trump offered no specifics, but touted it as a needed step. “I think it’s going to happen pretty quickly,” he said. He never mentioned the word “Easter.” \n\nAfter all that, it was hard not to think of Trump’s whole “beautiful timeline” as yet another monumental act of Presidential flimflammery, a distracting week of misdirection to keep us all occupied while those of us who are still working do so from home. Trump’s open-by-Easter pledge may well be as quickly forgotten as his other lies during the coronavirus crisis thus far, such as when he said that the cases would go down to near zero in a few days, that the disease would simply disappear, and that it would never make it to our shores in significant numbers.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThese daily Presidential briefings have understandably become controversial among the national media, which is wary of being played by an attention-seeking President. Neither the *Times* nor the Washington *Post* is sending reporters to them, citing the health risk. (A journalist who had attended several of the sessions has reportedly contracted the virus; even so, the President refuses to follow the social-distancing dictates that his government is urging others to practice.) Sources at various television networks have said that the networks were considering no longer airing them, although they have so far continued to do so. The *Post* columnist Margaret Sullivan has argued that the briefings should not be broadcast live anymore, citing the fact that the President was using them as a platform for “self-aggrandizement,” “media-bashing,” and “exaggeration and outright lies.” \n\nTrump will keep doing them, however, because they work. According to the *Times*, ratings for Trump’s briefings rival those for “hit reality shows and prime-time football.” Trump, whose [star turn](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2019\u002F01\u002F07\u002Fhow-mark-burnett-resurrected-donald-trump-as-an-icon-of-american-success) on NBC’s “The Apprentice” arguably had as much to do with his election to the Presidency as anything else, is obsessed with ratings. His other metrics are good, too, including a Gallup poll showing him with the highest approval rating of his Presidency (forty-nine per cent, versus a forty-five per cent disapproval rating). Even more striking were the results of a CBS\u002FYouGov poll, released this week, in which respondents were asked what sources of information about the coronavirus they found most credible. Democrats rated medical professionals and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention most highly. Trump came in last among this group, at fourteen per cent. But, for Republicans, Trump came in at the top, with ninety per cent saying that they trusted the President’s information about the coronavirus, making him tied for first place with medical professionals. The poll shows that, even when their own lives are literally at stake, a significant subset of the American population no longer believes in almost anything other than the President.\n\nThis, in the end, is why Trump’s nightly Follies matter. Even if he cannot reopen the country by Easter, and governors and mayors ignore him, as they surely will. Even if what he says is so contradictory and at times patently false that his own followers could not possibly heed his advice as a practical guide to action. \n\nIn the long course of the Vietnam War, which lasted a full decade, some fifty-eight thousand Americans died. With the pandemic, many scientific models publicized in recent days have projected that U.S. deaths could reach far beyond that figure by the time the coronavirus has run its course, depending at least in part on what decisions Trump and other leaders make in the coming months. But this week’s Follies have shown an irresolute leader who does not want to fight the war or even, on many days, admit that it exists. He is a cartoon caricature of a wartime President, not a real one. \n\nA Vietnam draft-dodger who used a phony foot problem to get out of that war, Trump this week has reminded us that he would like to be a coronavirus draft-dodger, too. But the fight is not a hoax, no matter how often he suggests it is, and the President, like it or not, is already in the fight. On Tuesday, he told the country that he would soon be reopening it, “as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy.” By the time you read this, though, the battle will not be over, or even really begun. As soon as Trump finished speaking on Thursday, CNN interrupted the briefing to broadcast the news that it had been the deadliest day yet in the pandemic for the United States, with at least two hundred and thirty-seven dead, and hours more to go.\n\n----------\n##A Guide to the Coronavirus\n- How to practice [social distancing](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fq-and-a\u002Fthe-vital-importance-of-isolation?itm_content=footer-recirc), from responding to a sick housemate to the pros and cons of ordering food.\n- How people cope and [create new customs](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Four-columnists\u002Fcoping-camaraderie-and-human-evolution-amid-the-coronavirus-crisis?itm_content=footer-recirc) amid a pandemic.\n- What it means to [contain and mitigate](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnews-desk\u002Fwhat-it-means-to-contain-and-mitigate-the-coronavirus?itm_content=footer-recirc) the coronavirus outbreak.\n- How much of the world is [likely to be quarantined](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Four-columnists\u002Fhow-much-of-the-world-will-be-quarantined-by-the-coronavirus?itm_content=footer-recirc)?\n- Donald Trump in [the time of coronavirus](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fdaily-comment\u002Ftrump-in-the-time-of-the-coronavirus?itm_content=footer-recirc).\n- The coronavirus is [likely to spread for more than a year](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnews-desk\u002Fhow-long-will-it-take-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine?itm_content=footer-recirc) before a vaccine could be widely available.\n- We are all [irrational panic shoppers](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fculture\u002Fannals-of-gastronomy\u002Fwe-are-all-irrational-panic-shoppers?itm_content=footer-recirc).\n- The strange terror of [watching the coronavirus take Rome](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fdispatch\u002Fthe-strange-terror-of-watching-coronavirus-take-rome?itm_content=footer-recirc).\n- How pandemics [change history](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fnews\u002Fq-and-a\u002Fhow-pandemics-change-history?itm_content=footer-recirc).","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5e306853a5be110008e2ea00","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Coronavirus","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"coronavirus"},{"id":"5c2e1d6f22d4972cd5b83380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Press Conferences","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"press-conferences"},{"id":"5c2e1cb7397f5b30646d063d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Vietnam War","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"vietnam-war"}],"sections":[{"id":"5abaab1276329f082506d466","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Letter from Trump’s Washington","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"letter-from-trumps-washington"},{"id":"5e6a54911785a2000935d0c4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Coronavirus","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"coronavirus"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"59d6671a65b89d2e73804d42","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Susan B.
