Despite government officials and health agencies thanking Musk for his generosity, the billionaire has not followed through. Some ventilators are waiting to be shipped to individual hospitals; others turned out to not be the life-saving devices Musk had pledged.</p><p>Just about a month ago, Tesla CEO and self-professed superhero Elon Musk said <a class href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/musk-says-hell-produce-ventilators-if-needed-but-mocks-covid-19-preparations">he would use his resources to make ventilators</a> “if there is a shortage.” (At the time, the ventilator shortage was already deemed imminent by experts.)</p><p>COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc across the United States, killing thousands of people each day. Musk’s many promised ventilators would surely help the country now — and in the immediate future — as numbers of serious cases in the country crescendo.</p><p>And yet: almost none of Musk’s ventilators have arrived at the hospitals that sorely need them. For all intents and purposes, the ventilators are entirely missing in action. Musk continues to push the narrative that he’s stepping in to help save lives at a time when his resources are needed most. So where are his promised ventilators?</p><p><u>Let’s break it down, shall we? —</u> It may be an understatement to say that Elon was slow to show support for measures being taken to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
