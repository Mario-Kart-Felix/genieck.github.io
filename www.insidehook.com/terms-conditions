<p>You also warrant that any “moral rights” in posted materials have been waived.</p>
<p><strong>Linked Sites</strong><br />
You may be able to link to third parties’ websites (“Linked Sites”) from the InsideHook Web Site. Linked Sites are not, however, reviewed, controlled, or examined by InsideHook in any way and InsideHook is not responsible for the content, availability, advertising, products or other materials of any such Linked Sites, or any additional links contained therein. These links do not imply InsideHook’s endorsement of or association with the Linked Sites. It is your sole responsibility to comply with the appropriate terms of service of the Linked Sites as well as with any other obligation under copyright, secrecy, defamation, decency, privacy, security and export laws related to the use of such Linked Sites and any content contained thereon. In no event shall InsideHook be liable, directly or indirectly, to anyone for any loss or damage arising from or occasioned by the creation or use of the Linked Sites or the information or material accessed-through these Linked Sites. You should direct any concerns to that site’s administrator or webmaster. InsideHook reserves the exclusive right, at its sole discretion, to add, change, decline or remove, without notice, any feature or link to any of the Linked Sites from the Web Site and/or introduce different features or links to different users.</p>
<p>SPECIAL NOTICE: THE LINKED SITES MAY CONTAIN CONTENT AND GRAPHICS THAT CONTAIN SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL UNSUITABLE FOR MINORS, OR THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE OFFENSIVE. IF YOU ENTER THESE LINKED SITES, YOU ASSERT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL ADULT AGE IN YOUR JURISDICTION TO VIEW SUCH MATERIALS AND THAT THE VIEWING, READING, AND/OR DOWNLOADING OF CONTENT FROM THESE LINKED SITES DOES NOT VIOLATE THE COMMUNITY STANDARDS OF YOUR LOCALITY, CITY, TOWN, COUNTY, STATE, PROVINCE, COUNTRY OR OTHER COMMUNITY TO WHICH YOU BELONG, AND/OR FROM WHICH YOU ACCESS THESE LINKED SITES.</p>

We reserve the right, however, to rescind any permission granted by us to link through any type of link, and to require termination of any such link to the Web Site, at our discretion at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Contests, Promotions, Simulations or Games</strong><br />
From time to time, InsideHook may offer as part of the Services, either on or through the Web Site, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, simulations or games (collectively, “Games”). To participate in Games, players may be required to complete a registration form. Upon submission, all registrations become the exclusive property of InsideHook. Registered users (each, a “Registered User”) are permitted only one account. Registered Users with more than one account are subject to immediate disqualification from any Game, unless the description of the Game expressly invites a user to register multiple times. InsideHook, at its sole discretion, may suspend or revoke the registration of any Registered User.</p>
<p>Registered Users agree to release InsideHook and its agents, advertisers, sponsors or promotional partners, from all liability arising from participation in any of Game located on, or accessed through, the Services. InsideHook is not responsible for technical, hardware or software failures of any kind, lost or unavailable network connections, or failed, incomplete, garbled or delayed computer transmissions which may limit any Registered User’s ability to participate in any Game.</p>
<p>Each Registered User agrees to be bound by the rules of any Game and by the rules of fair play and consideration of fellow Registered User. A Registered User who violates any of the rules or guidelines for behavior published on the Web Site, or the site where the Game is conducted, are subject to immediate disqualification and revocation of their registration. InsideHook is under no obligation to award any prize to any Registered User who violates a published rule or guideline.</p>
<p>Some Games may offer prizes to Registered Users. All prizes are subject to the official game or contest rules published with that Game. All Registered Users who receive a prize through a Game are solely responsible for all federal, state and local taxes associated with the receipt of such Registered User’s prize.</p>
<p>InsideHook reserves the right to cancel, terminate or alter any Game or the rules thereof at any time without prior notification.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong><br />
All materials contained in Services, apart from user generated Content or Contributions, are the copyrighted property of InsideHook and its affiliates or licensors. As between InsideHook and you, InsideHook is the sole owner of all non-user generated Content and Contributions on the Services, including without limitation, all applicable U.S. and non-U.S. copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights thereto. Except as otherwise specifically provided in these Terms and Conditions, you may not download or save a copy of the Web Site, the Services or any portion thereof, for any purpose. You may, however, print a copy of individual screens appearing as part of the Services solely for your personal, non-commercial use or records, provided that any marks, logos or other legends that appear on the copied screens remain on, and are not removed from the printed or stored images of such screens. All title and intellectual property rights in and to the content of the Linked Sites is the property of the respective content owner and may be protected by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties.</p>
<p><strong>Parental Permission</strong><br />
The Services are not intended to be a children’s site or a site for minors or individuals under the age of 21, therefore, some of the available information may concern certain topics that may not be appropriate for for children/minors or individuals not of legal drinking age. By accepting these Terms and Conditions, you confirm that you are at least 21 years of age.</p>
<p><strong>Editorial</strong><br />
InsideHook items are selected by our editors. No one can pay to be featured on InsideHook. That’s what advertising is for, and it’s always labeled as such. Selling ourselves (literally) would destroy the legitimacy, integrity, and fun of InsideHook. Plus, we’d never earn your trust that way. That said, on occasion, we will send out “advertorial” e-mails on behalf of sponsors. You’ll recognize them from the subject line, which will indicate that the email is advertorial. Advertorial emails are paid for. When you sign up for InsideHook you are agreeing not only to get our content delivered to you free, but also to occasionally receive one of these advertorial e-mails from our sponsors. If you would prefer not to get these e-mails, just unsubscribe from all editions of InsideHook (unfortunately you won’t be getting -any- InsideHook e-mails any more).</p>
<p>We would never sell our subscriber list to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br />
We are committed to protecting your privacy and security and have explained in detail the steps we take to do so. We urge you to read our <a title="Privacy Policy" href="https://www.insidehook.com/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a>.</p>
