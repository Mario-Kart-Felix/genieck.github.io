      <title>“Lawless” Wins Al Nakkula Award for Police Reporting</title>

                <p class="byline">
                <a class="name" href="https://www.propublica.org/people/propublica">ProPublica</a>                </p>
                                                        
                

        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">Anchorage Daily News reporter Kyle Hopkins is the winner of the Al Nakkula Award for Police Reporting. He was honored for his investigation “Lawless,” a project of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network, which uncovered a sexual assault crisis in rural Alaska and how it is compounded by a profound lack of public safety services.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">The series’ first story, based on more than 750 public records requests and interviews, found that <a href="https://features.propublica.org/local-reporting-network-alaska/alaska-sexual-violence-village-police/">one in three Alaska communities has no local law enforcement of any kind</a>. These are also among the most vulnerable communities in the United States, with the highest rates of sexual assault, suicide and domestic violence. The series also found that dozens of Alaska communities, desperate for police of any kind, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/stebbins-alaska-cops-criminal-records-domestic-violence">hired officers convicted of felonies</a>, domestic violence, assault and other offenses that would make them ineligible to work in law enforcement or even as security guards anywhere else in the country. 
The impact of the stories was dramatic, with tangible steps taken to address the crisis. After U.S. Attorney General William Barr declared the problems identified in our stories to be a public safety crisis, the U.S. Department of Justice pledged more than $52 million to provide public safety officers, training and infrastructure in Alaska villages. The U.S. attorney’s office announced it will add rural prosecutors, and Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced plans to hire 15 additional rural Alaska troopers — increasing the number of state law enforcement officers based directly in villages by 40% in 2020. In addition, the Alaska Police Standards Council has proposed changing state regulations that govern the hiring and screening of village police officers. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">Co-sponsored by the University of Colorado College of Media, Communication and Information and the Denver Press Club, the Al Nakkula Award recognizes a reporter, or team, for outstanding accomplishment in police reporting. <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/2020/04/16/series-lack-law-enforcement-throughout-rural-alaska-wins-2020-al-nakkula-award">Learn more about the award here</a>.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">Private equity-backed medical staffing companies that have cut doctors’ pay are continuing to spend millions on political ads, according to Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/">disclosures</a>.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">The ads amount to $2.2 million since Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency on Jan. 31. About $1.2 million has been spent since President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration on March 13, the disclosures show.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">The companies behind the ads, TeamHealth and Envision Healthcare, are among the staffing firms that have <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/overwhelmed-hospitals-face-a-new-crisis-staffing-firms-are-cutting-their-doctors-hours-and-pay">cut pay and benefits</a> for emergency room doctors and other medical workers. The companies say the cuts are needed to cope with falling income because non-coronavirus patients are avoiding hospitals. Executives at TeamHealth and Envision also took pay cuts.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">“Our attention will be focused on our clinicians so they can provide care for patients who need it,” Envision CEO Jim Rechtin said in a statement this month.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.4">But Envision and TeamHealth have continued to pour money into a joint political ad campaign. Their TV and radio spots are aimed at pressuring lawmakers working to address “surprise billing,” where patients get stuck with huge medical costs from out-of-network providers they had no say in choosing. The ads oppose capping out-of-network costs based on median prices in the area.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">The air time was bought through Doctor Patient Unity, an advocacy group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/upshot/surprise-billing-laws-ad-spending-doctor-patient-unity.html">funded</a> by staffing firms TeamHealth and Envision. TeamHealth, which has more than 16,000 clinicians, is owned by Blackstone, and KKR owns Envision, with more than 25,000 medical providers.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">Doctor Patient Unity has spent $57 million on ads since its campaign started last June, making it the largest political advertiser other than presidential campaigns, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad-tracking firm.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">Doctor Patient Unity stood by its campaign and vowed to continue fighting against legislation that the group says would hurt doctors. “It was a misguided proposal before COVID-19 – it’s reckless in this current environment,” spokesman Greg Blair said in a statement. “While the big insurance companies continue to report massive earnings amid an unprecedented economic downturn, we remain committed to defending our doctors and clinicians as they fight COVID-19 on the frontlines.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">TeamHealth and Envision declined to comment beyond Blair’s statement. Blackstone and KKR didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.4">The spending totals don’t include digital ads, which aren’t reported to the FCC. Facebook’s own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=US&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=2267405033373814">disclosures</a> show several thousand dollars more on recent ads invoking the coronavirus pandemic to make their case. Some of the ads name individual lawmakers and target their constituents.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.5">“Doctors are stepping up to face the coronavirus crisis,” an ad from April said. “During this crisis, Congress needs to ensure they have the resources they need to continue saving lives.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">A professional group representing ER doctors <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/medical-staffing-companies-owned-by-rich-investors-cut-doctor-pay-and-now-want-bailout-money">asked Azar</a> to provide $3.6 billion of aid to emergency physician practices. The professional group’s president who signed the request is an executive at Envision.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1"><a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/W000817-elizabeth-warren">Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.</a>, and <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/P000618-katie-porter">Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif.</a>, called on the companies’ private equity backers to reverse the pay cuts, citing ProPublica’s earlier reporting. “As business leaders who direct and manage billions of dollars, you should be stepping up to protect the financial security of frontline essential workers,” Porter and Warren said in an April 15 <a href="https://twitter.com/RepKatiePorter/status/1250524828274249728?s=20">letter</a>. “They are putting themselves at risk every single day to provide for those fighting COVID-19, and to put them at risk of financial harm during this time is unacceptable.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">Lawmakers have spent months hammering out a deal on surprise billing that balances the interests of patients, doctors and insurers. House and Senate committee chairs and ranking members struck a bipartisan compromise but weren’t able to get it included in the December spending deal or the March coronavirus stimulus package.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">The ads from Doctor Patient Unity oppose that bill because it would settle out-of-network bills according to median costs in the area, an approach that the ads attack as “government rate setting.” The ads urge viewers to call their representatives to thank them for opposing the proposal or urge them to oppose it.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">Blair, the group’s spokesman, said the legislation would “impose a 20% pay cut on our medical professionals, risking hospital closures and making it harder for patients to get the critical care they need.” The 20% figure, Blair said, is based on a <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-07/s1895_0.pdf">Congressional Budget Office report</a> from July. But the CBO report does not predict a 20% drop across to board; rather, it says the proposal to pay out-of-network bills based on local median rates would push the average (mean) rate to converge on the median, a difference of 15% to 20% nationwide.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">“Under current law, the distribution of payment rates across all providers is highly skewed — some command rates that are well above the median,” the CBO analysts wrote. “Although the national average rate may drop by such an amount, the effects within a given market for any particular insurer and for specific providers will be quite different, with payment rates rising in some cases and falling in others.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">An advocacy group representing health insurers, who are at odds with the staffing firms over the proposed legislation, called Doctor Patient Unity’s ads misleading. “At a time when they are cutting back benefits and pay for their own employees, they prefer to invest more resources in running a disingenuous ad campaign about their support for doctors,” the Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing said in a statement to ProPublica. “Give us a break. Millions of patients are at risk of receiving a bankrupting surprise medical bill because these companies and out-of-network providers continue to exploit the market.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3">Envision has said it won’t send surprise bills to COVID-19 patients, so patients will be responsible only for in-network copays. TeamHealth <a href="https://www.teamhealth.com/news-and-resources/featured-article/as-coronavirus-unfolds-teamhealth-upholds-commitment-to-patients-no-balance-billing/">said</a> it won’t bill patients above what insurers pay (known as “balance billing”).</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.4">“They’ve always just been worried more about the bottom line than being appreciative of their people,” said an Envision doctor whose pay was cut and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the company has prohibited employees from speaking publicly. “Physicians don’t feel like they’re being heard and respected for what they do, but we still show up and take care of patients. This is part of what’s breaking the system down.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">Days before the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo kicked off, area politicians celebrated this great piece of Americana — dubbed the world’s largest livestock show — which was going forward in the age of the coronavirus.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, a 29-year-old rising political star, <a href="https://upload.latest.facebook.com/HarrisCoJudge/posts/665622087523155">posted on Facebook</a> on Feb. 28 how “pumped” she was for rodeo season, sharing a list of her favorite songs. “Look forward to seeing y’all there! #RodeoHouston.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">She also reassured residents that “the overall risk of COVID-19 to the general public within our counties remains low at this time.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">Not to be outdone, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner donned a black suit and cowboy hat and <a href="https://twitter.com/SylvesterTurner/status/1233558342880108544">posted a video</a> of himself line dancing to the “wobble.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.4">But over at the Rodeo Houston headquarters, organizers worried that the 20-day event would have to be shut down early as they watched a global increase in coronavirus cases. While COVID-19 had not been confirmed in Houston at that point, they knew it was a matter of time.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">“Do we really think the rodeo will be shut down?” they asked Dr. Kelly Larkin, an ER physician and longtime board member of the rodeo.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">Yes, she said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">Enough evidence existed that “something was probably going to develop during that time period. We just didn’t know how or when,” she told ProPublica and The Texas Tribune.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">A review by the news organizations of thousands of emails, social media posts, press releases and public comments by civic and municipal leaders, along with interviews, shows that government leaders, health officials and rodeo organizers knew that once the novel coronavirus was detected here, they would have to shut down the rodeo. Many in the community were urging organizers and city leaders to cancel the event.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.4">“It is my belief that you should use your authority to basically shut down the Houston Rodeo or at least those components of it that will take place in a closed arena,” attorney Seth Chandler, the former director of the University of Houston’s Health Law &amp; Policy Institute, wrote to Dr. David Persse, the head of the city’s Health Department, before opening day.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.5">Chandler, who had worked with Persse on seminars involving the Zika virus, added, “I know full well the Rodeo is hardly the only potential source of spread in Texas. But it strikes me as the most serious threat. We can, of course, wait until we have confirmed cases, and doing so might make a closure more politically palatable. But by the time we discover a confirmed case, there are likely 50 circulating in the community...”</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">Organizers and other key leaders shared little of these concerns with the public and instead remained on message: COVID-19 was not a local threat and the 20-day rodeo would go on.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the city’s largest annual event, attracting 2.5 million people and generating nearly $400 million in economic activity for the region. Thousands of kids spend their entire year preparing for the livestock show.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">Ultimately, on March 11, after eight days, the rodeo shut down. A police officer from a neighboring county who attended a pre-rodeo barbecue tested positive for COVID-19 — evidence that it was now spreading in the community. The health department is now confident the officer caught the virus at the rodeo.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">So far, at least 18 people who attended the rodeo and live in four counties surrounding Houston have tested positive for the coronavirus, though it is unclear if they all contracted it at the event. The city of Houston, which reports its cases separately, did not provide ProPublica and the Tribune with its updated figure, saying it is busy responding to COVID-19.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.4">The actual number of people with ties to the rodeo who were infected may never be known. While testing remains problematic across the United States, <a href="https://apnews.com/f784aa74ae12b7ccc8ec1660f0b55479">Texas ranks among the worst</a> in the country.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.5">Persse, who also serves as medical director for the rodeo’s safety committee, said no one wanted to make a rushed decision, fearing they would lose the public’s confidence. At the end of day, he said, “the community has got to believe we have their overall interest at heart.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">Claus Wilke, a University of Texas at Austin biologist who studies the evolution of viruses, believes the rodeo should have closed earlier, although he said it’s hard to pin the blame solely on organizers or the city when neither the federal government nor Texas Gov. Greg Abbott had issued guidance on such events.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">“I see this as a political failure first, and probably more so at the level of the federal government,” he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">“By early March, it was already out of control in Italy. At that point we should have been fully aware of what was happening,” he said. “For a disease spreading widely, all it takes is one person who drives a car from an area where it has been circulating to an area where it hasn’t and there you have it.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3">The country’s fourth-largest city was not the only to grapple with decisions about what to do regarding thousands of events — big and small — iconic to their communities and, at times, huge economic drivers. In Seattle, its beloved soccer team, the Sounders, played before a crowd of 33,000 fans despite recommendations from health officials that large events be cancelled, ProPublica and the Seattle Times <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/health-officials-recommended-canceling-events-with-10-50-people-then-33000-fans-attended-a-major-league-soccer-game">reported</a>.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.4">In the coming weeks and months, states and cities across the country will have to decide when to allow large gatherings again and may encounter the very struggles that Seattle and Houston leaders have faced: protecting the public while igniting economic growth, providing transparency while not creating fear.</p>

<h3>Rodeo Organizers Brace for the Worst: a Cancellation</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.5">Here is the backstory on how local leaders tried in vain to pull off the rodeo, a signature Texas event held nearly every year since 1932 — with the exception of 1937 due to a fire.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.6">Rodeo organizers and city Health Department officials had tracked the spread of the coronavirus since January and more closely as opening day approached, knowing it would impact the efforts of 35,000 volunteers, 135 full-time staff and the millions of dollars in educational grants and scholarships given to participants.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">In his weekly update to the mayor on Feb. 27, Persse wrote about community spread in California and Washington State. “As predicted, the U.S. strategy of ‘containment’ appears to begin to fail. We should expect to have community spread in Texas shortly.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.1">Larkin and the rodeo executive leadership were meeting daily. They were carefully watching the spread, monitoring suspected cases, discussing the delays in getting local test results, just flat-out hoping they could keep the rodeo open for yet another day.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.2">“We were watching what was happening in other parts of the world, and we knew that it was happening here,” said Larkin.</p>

<h3>Warning Signs Were Everywhere</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.3">The World Health Organization and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency by the end of January.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.4">Federal officials warned it would likely spread in the United States. “It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/health/coronavirus-us.html"> said on Feb. 25</a>.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.5">Rodeo organizers were getting multiple calls from people concerned about the event taking place and asking what they were doing to prevent an outbreak. Lisa Gagnon, the rodeo’s executive director of marketing, asked the city for help. “With the Rodeo starting on Tuesday, we welcome any feedback, advice or collaboration,” she wrote on March 1.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.6">The rodeo nearly doubled the number of hand sanitizer stations and posted signs throughout the grounds reminding people to <a href="https://twitter.com/RODEOHOUSTON/status/1236366215142146049"> properly wash their hands</a>. They added a <a href="https://www.rodeohouston.com/Health-Tips"> health tips sheet</a> on their website with CDC guidelines and advised people who felt sick to stay home.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.7">“This is a difficult situation,” Persse wrote in an email to Gagnon. “There are NO cases in SE Texas as yet. Many expect that there will be, we just do not know when or whom.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.8">But he warned there would “inevitably be the criticism that those gatherings should have been closed/canceled” if there’s later a case of a person who attended one of them.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.9">“Yet, today we have no reason to do so, other than to stimulate even more unnecessary fear,” Persse added. “We need to anticipate that and give people the best guidance we can in an environment where [we] do not necessarily have all of the facts. As of today, there is no reason not to go to the Rodeo. I for one am very much looking forward to seeing Willie Nelson, never seen him before! Wish I had better news to share.”</p>

<h3>The Case Count Begins</h3>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">In his email to Persse, the Houston health director, Chandler, said he calculated that at least 10 people in the Houston area could have contracted the virus and, in a closed space like the rodeo, the possibility existed for the virus “spiraling out of control.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.1">By March 3, the day the rodeo opened, there were more than 90,000 cases confirmed globally, and <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map"> about 70</a> in the United States. Places such as Washington state and New York were becoming hot spots.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.2">Then, there was the first local case.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.3">On March 4, a man in his 70s who lives in neighboring Fort Bend County became the state’s first confirmed coronavirus case after returning from a river cruise in Egypt.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.4">As the rodeo went on, more emails from constituents asked the mayor to consider closing it.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.5">“No confirmed cases today DOES NOT mean there isn’t any case in Houston, as many patients don’t have symptoms but can spread the disease,” a March 4 email said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.6">Two days later, there were six more cases.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.7">All were related to the same Nile River cruise — not evidence of community spreading.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.8">Nearly 500,000 people had already attended the barbecue cook-off and rodeo.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.9">“Every day was like holding your breath,” Larkin said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.10">With every negative test, the rodeo lived for another day.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.11">But the threat of the virus kept getting closer.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.12">“The reality is there were people saying, including public health officials, you don’t have to cancel events or close schools until you have community transmission, but that was flawed advice,” said Ellen Carlin, an assistant professor in the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University. “From a health perspective, it’s very risky.”</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Across the state, as of Sunday, there were nearly 19,000 cases of COVID-19 reported, with 4,600 in Harris County — more than twice as many as the next county. Given low testing rates, UT Austin <a href="https://cid.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/cid/files/covid-risk-maps_counties_4.3.2020.pdf?m=1585958755">researchers assume</a> that one in 10 cases is tested and reported.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.1">On March 6, Austin Mayor Steve Adler <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/06/sxsw-texas-coronavirus-fears/">canceled South by Southwest</a>, an annual arts and technology festival scheduled for March 13-22 that draws hundreds of thousands of visitors from more than 100 countries.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.2">Pressure to shut the rodeo intensified, but rodeo and government leaders insisted the rodeo was different.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.3">“The Rodeo is predominantly a local event, with 73% of the 2019 Rodeo visitors residing in the greater Houston area, 94% in Texas, and 99% in the U.S.,” rodeo <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/rodeo/2020/03/07/heres-why-organizers-say-there-are-no-plans-to-wrap-up-rodeohouston-early-amid-slew-of-high-profile-event-cancellations/">organizers said</a>. “In contrast, 26% of the 2019 SXSW attendees were international.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.4">Persse remained confident that they had stopped the spread of coronavirus from that Egyptian cruise in time. Still, on March 7, his office began drafting news releases and key messages in the event of community spread.</p>

<h3>Cases Add Up and Pressure Intensifies on the Rodeo</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.5">More COVID-19 cases became public. When a New York woman who attended the rodeo on March 8 tested positive, the Houston Health Department said, “she was not symptomatic during the Rodeo visit and there is a low risk to attendees.”</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">However, there had already been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/health/coronavirus-symptoms-germany.html">reports</a> from China and Europe of patients who tested positive despite having no symptoms or very mild ones, and epidemiologists were warning that such patients could infect others before they realized they were sick with COVID-19. The virus has an incubation period of up to 14 days.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.1">By March 9, the Houston area had 12 confirmed cases, all still tied to the cruise.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.2">Another case came the following day.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.3">A young woman tested positive. She had been studying abroad and flew back to Houston from Italy feeling ill.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.4">Some 786,000 people had already attended the rodeo.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.5">Then came the call.</p>

<h3>The Rodeo Must Shut Down</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.6">“We have a patient who was a community-acquired case who was hospitalized,” Persse told Larkin.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.7">It was about 9:30 p.m. on March 10. The K-pop boy band NCT 127 was playing in the NRG Stadium.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.8">“Darn,” Larkin recalled responding, “It was a ‘wow’ kind of moment.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.9">That’s all she needed to know.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.10">By then more than 850,000 had attended the rodeo. An additional million attendees were expected over the next 12 days.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.11">She got on the phone with rodeo president Joel Cowley.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.12">Hours before the city held a press conference to announce the cancellation, Larkin and Cowley gathered staff to explain why one case had changed everything.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.13">“When there’s a community-acquired patient where you don’t know where they got it from, it means they got it from someone who is out there who doesn’t know they have it and they are just out there going to the grocery store, going to school, pumping gas,” Larkin said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">Teachers, vendors and parents — some crying — called the city to plead that the rodeo stay open. They couldn’t bear the thought of the students not being able to show their animals and the economic loss.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.1">On the rodeo’s last day, over 2,000 youth from across the state had checked in to show their lambs and goats. An additional 2,600 unloaded their heifers for what was supposed to be a multi-day event.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.2">Everyone got in for free.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.3">Then, by 4 p.m., they all had to be off the premises.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.4">Based on when the police officer started showing symptoms, Persse said he is confident the officer, who is in his 40s, caught the virus at the rodeo. Before the barbecue cook-off, he had been working security near a construction site, Persse said, which doesn’t involve a lot of human-to-human contact.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.5">“Which means somebody else brought it in and if they infected him, how many people at the rodeo did they infect?” he asked. “That’s always been my position, and that’s why we immediately moved to shut down the rodeo.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.6">During the announcement of the cancellation at City Hall on March 11, Turner said he had no regrets allowing the rodeo to go on. “We’re basing the decision based on the science and the medical advice and the facts that are presented.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.7">Turner did not respond to an interview request. His spokespeople referred ProPublica and the Tribune to the March press conference.</p>

<h3>Armchair Quarterbacking</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.8">While people in his line of work knew it was not a question of “if” but “when,” Persse said, “from the standpoint of community leaders, shutting down rodeos and airports and doing all those sorts of things before you have evidence of spread, that’s just completely counterintuitive to them.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.9">But Persse said he’s pleased that elected leaders responded once there was clear evidence of a community spread.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.10">“For some time, and especially this weekend, it became very evident that we were facing limitations in our testing capability,” Hidalgo said at the press conference on March 11. “Over the last couple of days it’s become clear that may give us in a sense an undercount.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">Although Wilke, the UT Austin biologist, advocated for canceling large gatherings early on, he said he also understands the difficulty of making those decisions.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.1">“Think of an earthquake, it happens, everybody can see it, can deal with it. With a pandemic, you have to make decisions when it feels too early,” he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.2">At no point did rodeo organizers feel they were doing something incredibly risky, Cowley said during an interview.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.3">“You can hindsight it to death and say we should have closed earlier,” he said. “We felt we were discussing this with experts, the experts were basing their opinions on science and facts, and we were still conducting our events being hyper vigilant about hygiene.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">Long before the coronavirus crisis shut down Illinois schools, state education officials had encouraged districts to prepare for circumstances when they would have to teach remotely. But most of the state’s 852 school districts didn’t have e-learning plans in place when schools closed in mid-March, a ProPublica Illinois-Chicago Tribune analysis has found.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">Many of those districts have found themselves scrambling to figure out how best to teach students when they can’t be face to face. They have had to search for the best online platforms — Google Meet or Zoom or Flipgrid or Seesaw? — and try to determine how many students lacked internet service while districts that had already established the logistics have been able to pivot more easily into actual instruction.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">“I do think that we would be facing a much smoother transition to remote learning if districts had spent more time developing the plans sooner, but we could not have predicted our current situation,” said Aaron Mercier, superintendent of the Regional Office of Education that serves Carroll, Jo Daviess and Stephenson counties along the state’s borders with Wisconsin and Iowa. “The results won’t be picture perfect e-learning in every situation, but our schools are committed to making sure that students continue to learn.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">On Friday, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced his decision to close all schools for the rest of the school year for the state’s 2 million students. In making the decision, Pritzker said he considered that Illinois has “an educational landscape in which some districts have more experience with remote learning than others,” a challenge that he said “weighed heavily” on the difficult decision to close schools for months.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">“Remote learning looks different in each of our communities and that’s encouraged. Some rely on paper and pencil methods more than digital, and vice versa,” Pritzker said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">The Illinois State Board of Education launched a pilot program in 2015 with three school districts to test the feasibility of teaching online during winter weather or other emergencies instead of having to make up the days in person. Based on the results of that program, the General Assembly last year passed a law allowing schools to use up to five e-learning days each school year as long as they created plans that were approved by the regional offices of education.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.4">While the e-learning plans were designed for short-term closures, districts that had developed those plans were in a better position to move to the ISBE-mandated remote learning at the end of March. For some districts, it meant students had already practiced how to use the online platforms. And districts surveyed families to determine which students needed a laptop or other device and who needed a mobile hot spot to access the internet.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">ProPublica Illinois and the Tribune surveyed the state’s 38 regional offices of education to determine how many districts had e-learning plans approved before the pandemic forced buildings to close. Information was provided for about 670 of Illinois’ 852 public school districts and special education cooperatives; roughly one in four, or about 200, had plans approved before March 17, the first day the governor shut schools. Of those, dozens submitted plans in the days leading up to the closures.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">Gurnee School District 56, in Chicago’s north suburbs, participated in the pilot program and practiced e-learning as if it were a fire drill: Teachers suddenly announced to their classes that it was time for e-learning, and students had to stop what they were doing, log in to their laptops or iPads and show they knew how to access their work.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">“There’s a huge learning curve” for both students and their teachers, said Colleen Pacatte, superintendent of the 2,000-student district. The practice sessions allowed the district to make adjustments in its system well before the pandemic hit, switching from one set of online tools that didn’t work to others that did and making video tutorials to parents so they could understand how to use the technology and help their children at home.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">“I empathize so much with the districts that are just trying to figure it out or districts running stuff off and delivering it,” Pacatte said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.4">These e-learning plans are different from the “remote learning” plans that the state required school districts to develop in late March. Remote learning plans can include both online and traditional work. The plans detail the hours teachers are available each day, how parents should submit attendance records for their children, what will be taught, how students can access learning materials and how school employees will communicate with families.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.5">ISBE directed schools to begin remote learning on March 31, allowing them up to five planning days before instruction began. Chicago Public Schools began <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-chicago-schools-remote-learning-20200413-ua6tk2d5iveojdzxqqeqee5g4y-story.html">r</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-chicago-schools-remote-learning-20200413-ua6tk2d5iveojdzxqqeqee5g4y-story.html">emote learning last week, following</a> five planning days and then a weeklong spring break. The district did not have an e-learning plan in place prior to the state shutdown.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">Many districts that didn’t have e-learning plans already approved have quickly created them.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">That includes some large districts in Naperville, Palatine, Schaumburg and Joliet — all of which finalized e-learning plans in March. Among the districts served through the regional education office in north Cook County, only Evanston District 202 had an e-learning plan in place before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">In the south suburban Will County region, five of the 33 school districts had approved e-learning plans before the state shutdown. While the adjustment has been difficult for teachers and students everywhere, districts that had already done some planning had the “basement of the house built” and didn’t need to start digging the foundation, said Will County regional superintendent Shawn Walsh.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3"><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/illinois-schools-online-tools-coronavirus-digital-divide">Regions of the state with greater internet accessibility</a> — measured by rates of broadband access per 1,000 households — were more likely to have e-learning plans in place, the Tribune-ProPublica Illinois analysis found. All 49 districts and public programs served by the north suburban Lake County Regional Office of Education had plans before March 17, though only 13 submitted the plans earlier in the school year. Most of the school districts in Grundy and Kendall counties as well as the education region that serves Jersey, Macoupin, Calhoun and Greene counties along the Missouri border had plans, too.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.4">“If you had a plan in place already, it would have made things easier. I was just talking to one of my superintendents a few minutes ago, and he feels the first week or so was a challenge and when they got things ironed out in this situation that things have run smoother,” Ron Daniels, a regional superintendent who oversees 45 school districts near St. Louis, said in an interview last week.</p>

                    <p class="dek">As the coronavirus spreads, hitting health care providers especially hard, doctors and nurses across the country report inadequate protective measures from their hospitals. Some feel they’ve been forced out of work — right when the country needs them most.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">Before schools closed, only two of Daniels’ schools had e-learning plans — a parochial school and a small elementary school. Many schools decided not to participate because their rural communities had no internet access, or it was unreliable. They would have preferred to make up lost days in person if there were emergency closures, though they couldn’t have anticipated a months-long shutdown, he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.1">The St. Rose School District in his region submitted an e-learning plan on March 25 for “March 31 - ?????” The plan requires the district’s 200 students, from kindergarten to eighth grade, to join their class through Google Meet every morning, when attendance is taken. Teachers upload to Google Drive “on the go learning packets” for each grade. Fourth graders get reading passages and math problems. Seventh-grade geography features daily reading passages on different parts of the world. On the 10th day of remote learning, students were assigned to read about the Berlin Wall.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.2">The shift to e-learning was an adjustment for school districts near Carlinville in central Illinois, none of which had e-learning plans in place before the COVID-19 shutdown.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.3">“This wasn’t something on our radar,” said Michelle Mueller, a regional superintendent who oversees 14 school districts across four counties. Most of them do not have a laptop or other device for each student, making remote learning a challenge. “Nobody in my area had the forethought where they had (plans) in place to use for inclement weather days. … It has really been a culture shock for my teachers.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.4">Maercker District 60, which has 1,300 students across three schools in DuPage County, developed an e-learning plan last school year, after the state legislature allowed it, and then practiced it on a Friday a year ago. Teachers tested different techniques and parents provided feedback.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">“We had a great response and, because of it, we decided we would roll it out anytime school needed to be canceled this year,” said Maercker superintendent Sean Nugent.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.1">Even before the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, teachers were meeting at the start of each month to design interactive distance-learning experiences in case of an unexpected school closure.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.2">“Our people were spending all of this year thinking through how might this work digitally versus having to do it in (a few) days, on the fly,” Nugent said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.3">The district’s online learning plan includes links to a Google form for elementary school parents to “check their child in” to school each day. There are YouTube videos of math lessons and daily assignments, and enrichment activities, including e-books, are catalogued in Google Drive. Teachers are available from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. every day for live text chats and impromptu Zoom and phone calls.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">In the remote learning guidance that ISBE issued at the end of March, the agency encouraged districts to focus first on students’ immediate needs to be physically and emotionally safe, and then deliver education. “Simplicity is best,” the 62-page guidance document said, acknowledging that remote learning doesn’t always mean learning with technology.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.1">“Given the reality of the digital divide, most schools may need to provide digital and nondigital access to content,” the document said, asking districts to offer students flexibility “that avoids penalizing students for their choice.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.2">Whether remote learning occurs online or with pencil and paper, schools should provide enough work for students to keep a regular daily schedule, the guidelines state. For kindergartners, that should amount to between 30 and 90 minutes per day; for high school students, between two and 4.5 hours. Multilingual and early-childhood students and students with disabilities also must have appropriate remote learning opportunities.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.3">Grades can be issued, but only if they don’t negatively affect a student’s academic standing. Missed or poor work can be redone or made up later, ISBE said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.4">ISBE surveyed school districts last month to assess how they planned to implement remote learning. Of the 655 that responded, about 9% said they were using only digital learning. An equal percentage said they were sticking to nondigital options. The majority of districts — about 82% — said they were blending online and paper-and-pencil instruction.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">More than 425 had students log into online learning websites like Khan Academy and more than 430 said they met face to face with students via FaceTime, Google Hangouts or other video chat services.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.1">Some 230 districts reported to ISBE that they’d been delivering class materials to students at home by running school-bus routes or other home delivery.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.2">In Gurnee, e-learning packets — basic information about how to go to class online — were handed out in plastic bags during school orientation last year, said Angenetta Frison, whose 4-year-old daughter, Taylor Hill, is in pre-kindergarten. Frison said she got the packet, set it aside and didn’t think of it again until the coronavirus hit.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.3">“It’s well put together,” Frison said, from the instructions to the planned online meetups so the students can see one another. “Everything has been seamless. ... All the parents I’ve spoken to echo that we’re glad we are in a district that was prepared.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.4">Pacatte, the Gurnee superintendent, said she’s tweaked the district’s e-learning plan for a longer-term shutdown. Now, she requires all classrooms to meet virtually at least once a week to help maintain relationships, which wouldn’t have been necessary during a snow day. Because the district didn’t need the five planning days, teachers are using consecutive Wednesdays for team meetings to assess the plans and make changes.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.5">Pacatte said she fielded calls from other superintendents asking for advice, and last month she was a panelist on several webinars to help other Illinois school officials catch up.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.6">For one of them, 900 people logged in to listen.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">On March 6, at 2:43 p.m., the health officer for Public Health — Seattle &amp; King County, the hardest-hit region in the first state to be slammed by COVID-19, sent an email to a half-dozen colleagues, saying, “I want to cancel large group gatherings now.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">The county’s numbers — 10 known deaths and nearly 60 confirmed cases as of late morning — were bad and getting worse. Many local events had already been called off for fear of spreading the coronavirus. Oyster Fest. The Puget Sound Puppetry Festival. A Women’s Day speaker series at the Gates Foundation. King County had ordered a stop to in-person government meetings unless they were considered essential.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">The health officer, Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, was to the Seattle area what Anthony Fauci would become for the country, the doctor at the microphone, dispensing guidance. Under <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=70.05.070">Washington</a> <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=246-100-036">law</a>, Duchin also had authority to make his wish an order.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">Duchin sent his email 28 hours before the Seattle Sounders, defending MLS champions and one of the league’s biggest draws, were to host a match at CenturyLink Field. No event in the coming days would generate a gathering to compare. The game would draw people from across the Puget Sound area, and maybe beyond.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">In the end, the match went on. Two days after the public health department wrote on Facebook, “We are making a recommendation to postpone or cancel events greater than 10-50 people,” officials in King County allowed a soccer match to be held with 33,000 fans, squeezed together.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">How that happened is captured in hundreds of pages of emails exchanged among federal, state and local officials, as well as executives from the Sounders, Seahawks, Mariners and XFL Dragons. Those records, obtained by ProPublica and The Seattle Times, show how one meeting would beget another, one email would beget a dozen more, all while the virus was taking rapid hold.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">When it was learned before the Sounders match that a concessions vendor at a recent XFL game at CenturyLink had tested positive, days passed before the public was notified. Even then, the press release went out only after a reporter who had caught a tip called to inquire.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">“Once the public learns of a confirmed case inside the venue, my counsel is that we’ll need every positive talking point we can get,” the Sounders senior vice president for communications wrote in one email thread.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">The records show how county officials struggled to send the public a clear, consistent message. They also reflect the extolling of sport, even in a time of contagion. In one email sent to the county officials after the match, a Sounders executive lauded the power of Sounders matches to provide “catharsis and community.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">Reporters made interview requests for this story to five Sounders executives and two Seahawks officials who also work with the company that operates CenturyLink Field. All seven either didn’t respond or declined to be interviewed.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">For Duchin, this first week of March presented all kinds of challenges: trying to figure out where King County was on the epidemic curve while working with little testing and a limited understanding of how the virus was transmitted.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">“In my career as a public health person, this has been the most both unprecedented and stressful event I’ve ever lived through,” Duchin said in a recent interview. “There was so much changing so rapidly. Every aspect of this was challenging us beyond our capacity. … Every element of this response was fraught with uncertainty.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">In Italy, a Feb. 19 soccer match, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/soccer/game-zero-spread-of-virus-linked-to-champions-league-match/"> later dubbed “Game Zero” and described by a respiratory specialist as a “biological bomb,”</a> has been cited as a possible reason that one province became an epicenter of the pandemic.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">But that match was played before the country’s first confirmed case of locally transmitted COVID-19. In Washington, community spread had been recognized <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/times-watchdog/lost-battle-how-coronavirus-overwhelmed-washington-states-efforts-to-contain-it/">at least a week</a> before the Sounders match. The governor <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/one-king-county-patient-has-died-due-to-covid-19-infection/">declared a state of emergency</a> on Feb. 29, the King County executive on March 1.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">On the evening of March 7, a Saturday, hundreds gathered in Occidental Park for their traditional March to the Match. They stood shoulder to shoulder and marched three blocks down Occidental Avenue to CenturyLink Field.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">Fans, tens of thousands of them, streamed into the stadium, using, if they wished, extra hand-sanitizing stations scattered about the concourses. The fans waved scarves, as they always do. The lower bowl stood for most of the match, as it always does. The crowd, in blue and green, chanted and cheered. In the 12th minute, they sang Woody Guthrie’s “Roll on Columbia.” Everyone was mere inches apart.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.1">When the Sounders scored in the 53rd minute, friends hugged. Neighbors high-fived. When the goal was disallowed moments later, disappointment reigned. But the Sounders scored again, late in the match, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/sounders/late-penalty-kick-helps-sounders-salvage-draw-against-columbus-in-front-of-lower-turnout-at-home/">to salvage a draw</a>. More hugs, chest to chest, more high-fives, skin on skin.</p>

<h3>“Emphasize Risk to Attendees Is Very Low”</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.2">With communicable disease, timely information can be critical. But in King County, there was little urgency in alerting the public to an infected concessions worker at the stadium where the Sounders game was to be played.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.3">On March 2, the public health department learned of a positive COVID-19 case and began researching past contacts. The next day, the investigators linked the case to CenturyLink Field: The infected person had been <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/centurylink-field-employee-who-worked-seattle-dragons-game-represents-a-low-risk-of-infection-for-game-attendees-public-health-officials-say/">a concessions vendor at a Feb. 22 XFL game</a> for the Seattle Dragons.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.4">On March 3, King County Executive Dow Constantine’s office privately coordinated with a Seahawks and CenturyLink Field executive about the vendor.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">A call was set for the next morning. But a public announcement about the positive test wouldn’t come that night or after the next morning’s phone call. In fact, it wouldn’t come for nearly two days.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.1">Instead, an internal XFL announcement to the league’s members and a press release from the county would be passed around among at least 35 public health officials, county employees, and executives for the Sounders, Dragons, the NFL’s Seahawks and Major League Baseball’s Mariners. The Seahawks also play in CenturyLink, while the Mariners were set to play in three weeks. There were at least 65 emails about how to handle the announcement and at least a half dozen drafts of the press release.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.2">On the evening of March 4, James Apa, a public health spokesman, received an early version of what the XFL planned to tell its teams and employees about the stadium worker.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.3">Apa quickly forwarded the press release to King County’s public health leadership, asking for comments. Duchin passed it along to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for its input. “[I]t will go national and probably get media attention,” Duchin wrote.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">A CDC expert responded 12 minutes later, advising, “They should emphasize risk to attendees is very low.” Benjamin Haynes, a CDC spokesman, seconded that in another email: “emphasize risk to attendees is very low.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.1">Haynes said in a recent interview that a CDC team had been summoned to Seattle that week to help local public health officials. They were told the concessions vendor worked at a beer stand and had been asymptomatic. The assessment of “very low” risk, Haynes said, was based on the vendor’s absence of symptoms and the CDC’s belief at the time that transmission occurred mostly through prolonged contact.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.2">The CDC now says the virus may be spread by people before they show symptoms. (There were also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/health/coronavirus-symptoms-germany.html">early reports at the time</a> that the virus could be spread by asymptomatic people.)</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.3">“It’s important not to compare what we know today to what was sent in an email on March 4,” Haynes said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.4">Duchin said he would still characterize the risk to the game’s attendees from that vendor as “very low,” based on the vendor’s lack of close contact with the public. “Not zero. Not zero. And there’s no precise way of characterizing risk,” he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.5">The night of the 4th, the XFL swapped in a shorter draft that dropped any mention of risk levels. The Seahawks complained to county and public health officials that the XFL had moved to a “hysteria inducing statement,” while Apa wrote that this new statement “would seem to create more unwarranted concern.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.6">Apa, in a recent interview, said the public health department’s investigation “found only four staff members who had close contact” with the vendor. The short statement sent out by the XFL “could be misinterpreted as the case posing more than minimal risk to attendees, which wasn’t true based on our investigation and CDC guidance,” Apa said. The county public health department decided to prepare its own statement “to set the record straight.”</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">The morning of March 5, the Sounders shared with other officials the team’s own proposed press release announcing that its March 7 match would be played. It cited “our network of medical experts” who had advised “that risk to the general public remains low,” and it avoided any mention of the vendor’s positive COVID-19 test.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.1">In her email to the others, the Sounders’ senior vice president of external affairs explained that the team didn’t plan to publicly release any information about the vendor, leaving the issue “to be coordinated” with stadium officials.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.2">“A prepared statement is below, which is for specific use in the event this incident breaks into the public sphere,” she wrote.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.3">That same morning, a Seattle Times reporter, working on a tip, called the county public health department’s media office asking for information about the vendor’s positive test.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.4">Nothing had yet been said publicly, so the reporter’s call triggered, over the next three hours, a cascade of edits to the statement that the county was preparing.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.5">“Recognizing the urgency, we’d like to send this by 3pm,” Constantine’s office wrote in an email to the Dragons, Mariners, Seahawks and Sounders.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.6">The XFL, a fledgling football league created by pro wrestling chief Vince McMahon, pushed for straightforward, direct disclosure.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">A preliminary version of the county’s press release said that the risk to fans who attended the Dragons’ Feb. 22 game was low, and that risk to fans at upcoming sporting events was low. The second part was deleted less than an hour before posting. “We’ve moved away from saying the risk is low,” Apa explained in an email to Constantine’s staff.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.1">The Sounders wanted a statement that said all of the teams’ and leagues’ medical staffs were “in continuous dialogue” with public health officials.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.2">“I believe that message of cohesion does a lot for public confidence,” wrote Alex Caulfield, the Sounders senior vice president of communications.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.3">The XFL disagreed. “We think that statement is awkward,” wrote league President Jeffrey Pollack, a former NBA, NASCAR and World Series of Poker executive. “It suggests that the leagues’ medical experts are advising on this matter.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.4">The back and forth continued until moments before the press release went out.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.5">“I would argue that the more robust the overall medical apparatus appears, the better it is for public confidence,” Caulfield responded. “Once the public learns of a confirmed case inside the venue, my counsel is that we’ll need every positive talking point we can get.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.6">Pollack replied: “Creating the appearance of any sort of ‘overall medical apparatus’ is not our concern. This is about the factual disclosure of something that was known to some, but not others, four days ago. This statement should be as straightforward, plain-spoken, and factual as possible, in our humble opinion.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">The sports teams didn’t want their brands tied to the positive test any more than necessary.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.1">“No desire to use our logos,” a Seahawks executive wrote. “I think it works best from our perspective to go out on King County letterhead,” the Mariners wrote.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.2">Shortly before 3 p.m., Apa emailed a statement to a Times reporter and the county <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/elected/executive/constantine/news/release/2020/March/05-covid-response-sports.aspx">posted the release on its website</a> a few minutes later.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.3">The county’s release wound up being an amalgam of messages on its letterhead: a stadium worker had tested positive; professional sporting events in Seattle would continue; but the risk of COVID-19 infection was rising, so people at higher risk should stay away.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.4">This same day, the county’s public health department stopped trying to track every past contact for every person who tested positive for COVID-19. The coronavirus was already too widespread.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.5">Based on modeling and area population, Duchin said, a “handful” of people with the virus probably attended the match: “In that entire stadium of 33,000 people, as low as five to 40, if you just do some back-of-the-envelope … calculations.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.6">There’s no saying how many people who attended the match later tested positive.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.7">“No,” Duchin said, “there’s no way we would be able to know that.”</p>

<h3>“Cancel Large Group Gatherings Now”</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.8">For King County, there was simply no squaring the decision to continue holding sporting events with its overall message to the public.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.9">On March 5, one hour after the county issued that press release, the public health department responded on Facebook to a commenter asking why the Emerald City Comic Con, which drew nearly 100,000 people last year, was still scheduled to be held.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.10">“At this time, we are making a recommendation to postpone or cancel events greater than 10-50 people,” the reply said. “We hope that private event organizers will strongly consider our recommendation in their decision making.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">The next day, on March 6, the questions kept coming.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.1">A little before 10 a.m., an engineer copied Constantine on an email urging that Comic Con, scheduled for the following week, should be canceled and the upcoming Sounders match should be played without spectators. “It is time for public health to trump (sorry) other considerations,” he wrote.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.2">Comic Con organizers had decided to move ahead in late February — taking comfort, in part, from the fact the Sounders still planned to play, said Lance Fensterman, president of Reedpop, the company that puts on Comic Con.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.3">The event was a massive undertaking. Blocks in 15 hotels had been reserved. Three ballrooms had been booked. More than 80,000 tickets had been sold.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.4">But on March 6, at 10:30 a.m., organizers announced they were <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/events/emerald-city-comic-con-being-postponed-until-summer-2020-due-to-coronavirus-concerns/">postponing the convention</a>. “[W]e are following the guidance of the local public health officials,” <a href="https://www.emeraldcitycomiccon.com/About/A-Statement-From-Reedpop/"> the announcement said</a>. “[I]t is our duty to make sure that your safety comes first.”</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">“We had to make a call,” Fensterman said in an interview. “And we did.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.1">Constantine declined to be interviewed for this story. But in an interview with The Seattle Times last month, Constantine said that March 6 was, for him, the day when the demand for action most hit home. “This is a time for pulling out all the stops,” the director general of the World Health Organization had just said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.2">But Constantine said he awoke on the 6th to see that Seattle’s public places were still crowded. The outbreak had hardly altered daily life at all.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.3">Half an hour after Comic Con’s announcement, Constantine’s deputy chief of staff emailed another staffer: “Dow is eager to see a list of events for just next week ASAP. Thank you!”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.4">Late in the morning, a contractor paid to help Constantine’s office with Facebook and other social media platforms emailed Constantine’s communications director: “One question we’re getting a TON is why King County isn’t forcing the cancelation of events like Sounders matches …”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.5">That same morning, Walter Sive, a financial consultant who has worked for several health care institutions, opened The Seattle Times. The first section detailed deaths in a nursing home, the state running short on public health money and a visit to Washington by Vice President Mike Pence to address the COVID-19 outbreak. There was even an artist’s rendering of someone coughing, spewing germs.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.6">But when Sive turned to the second section, there, at the top of the page, was the headline, “Sounders match is still on for Saturday.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.7">“It was like reading a newspaper from two different planets,” Sive said in an interview.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.8">Sive emailed Constantine, saying he was “rather stunned” by the conflicting messages coming from the county. “I’m appalled that the Sounders have not called off the game,” he wrote. “It puts at risk the health of our entire region. … [I]t is also a slap in the face to all of us who have been out there cancelling events and changing operations whatever the financial cost to us.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.9">For whatever reason, this email seemed to have the effect of a reckoning. Sive also sent it to Duchin, who responded to a colleague: “I do think we should move to canceling gatherings >500-1000.” Then, about a half hour later, Duchin went further, “Yes, I want to cancel large group gatherings now.”</p>

            </figure>
            
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">A week before, on Feb. 29, a Washington State Department of Health official had asked Duchin if he would advise canceling the Sounders’ March 1 season opener. Neither advised canceling the match, but Duchin said fans, “as much as possible,” should avoid “close face-to-face contact.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.1">Now, Duchin’s thinking had shifted. But that didn’t translate into immediate action. After Duchin wrote of wanting to cancel all large events, a colleague scheduled a meeting for the next morning for public health officials to talk about next steps. The day after that, on March 8, public health officials would brief elected officials, including Constantine and the governor.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.2">That meant the second meeting would be held the morning after the Sounders match.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.3">When asked by a reporter about the lag between Duchin’s email and the canceling of events, Apa wrote in reply: “None of our decisions have been instantaneous or done in isolation, and with respect to closures in particular, there are overlapping authorities between the county and state.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.4">“Dr. Duchin’s e-mail was one thread in a number of conversations happening among elected leaders and health officials in the region and state,” Apa wrote. Describing the meeting on March 7 meeting among health officials, Apa wrote, “The Sounders match that day was not part of the conversation, and there were no considerations to close it.”</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">A Constantine spokesman said the executive never received Duchin’s email.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.1">Duchin, in an interview, said public health officials try to find “the sweet spot” in making the transition to mandatory control measures. Close large events too early, and you risk community fatigue and noncompliance when distancing remains essential. Close them too late, and a surge of patients could overwhelm hospitals.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.2">In the hours before the match, pleas and questions kept coming into the county executive’s office.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.3">In the morning, one emailer wrote Constantine’s office to “make URGENT REQUEST” that the match be canceled and linked to a petition signed by “750+” people. The petition’s comments included, “Life is always more important than games and business,” and “Please protect our people!”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.4">In the afternoon, another emailer, under the subject line, “Sounders Game,” wrote to Constantine, “Why, of all events, was this not called off?”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.5">At CenturyLink, the gates opened at 5:30 p.m.</p>

<h3>“Catharsis and Community”</h3>

            </figure>
            
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Saturday night, after the match, Sounders general manager Garth Lagerwey said at a news conference, “We were really, really grateful to have the support of our fans.” He described various precautions the team had taken: “The kids didn’t walk out with the players today. We didn’t do a ceremonial handshake.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.1">Peter Tomozawa, the president of business operations and a former partner at Goldman Sachs, said the crowd was bigger than he had expected, adding, “Seattle turns out.” He described walking around before the match, talking with fans: “A really cool comment that was made to me was: ‘Thank you for hosting this event tonight. It gave us and our city something to cheer about.’”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.2">Like other MLS teams, the Sounders rely heavily on game-day revenues. The team keeps 70% of its gate receipts and shares the rest with the league. Last year, the Sounders — one of the league’s most valuable teams — generated about $47 million of revenue, according to estimates by Forbes and Statista, a marketing analytics firm.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.3">The day after the match, Maya Mendoza-Exstrom, a Sounders senior vice president, emailed Constantine’s staff to thank them for providing “accurate, credible information … while not prematurely sounding [the] alarm or stoking hysteria.” She added, “We stand ready to help be collaborative partners in public health, and where it remains safe to do so, provide some level of catharsis and community through our events.”</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">Gov. Jay Inslee’s chief of staff, David Postman, said he doesn’t recall any conversations with the governor’s office about whether the Sounders match should be played on March 7.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.1">But the next day, at the meeting with Inslee, Constantine and other elected officials, there was no doubt things had changed.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.2">“There was a presumption from the earliest part of our conversation that we weren’t going to have any more events of that sort — I mean, large sporting events weren’t going to happen,” Postman said. “It was very clear that those days were done.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.3">On March 11, five days after Duchin sent that email about canceling large events, both the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/inslee-orders-halt-on-large-gatherings-in-seattle-region-asks-schools-to-prepare-for-closure-to-slow-coronavirus-spread/">governor and county ordered</a> as much. Duchin issued a <a href="https://publichealthinsider.com/2020/03/11/new-limits-on-large-gatherings-other-emergency-strategies-to-slow-the-spread-of-covid-19/?fbclid=IwAR141iTOj9S5cCliqdEgd_4Ra3Ya7dxgKXlSZWpXjfpnbD2LstaCIPrw2eg"> health officer order</a> prohibiting gatherings of more than 250 people. At <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/inslee-orders-halt-on-large-gatherings-in-seattle-region-asks-schools-to-prepare-for-closure-to-slow-coronavirus-spread/">a press conference</a> announcing the orders, Constantine talked of the need to “act with urgency.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.4">On March 15, the Sounders <a href="https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2020/03/15/seattle-sounders-confirm-member-support-staff-has-covid-19"> announced</a> that a member of the club’s support staff had tested positive for COVID-19. The staff member had worked the March 7 match but “did not have access to the general public,” the announcement said. The individual fell ill four days after the match but was now recovering and “in good spirits,” the announcement said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.5">King County now has more than 4,800 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and at least 320 deaths, according to its <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/communicable-diseases/disease-control/novel-coronavirus/data-dashboard.aspx">data dashboard</a> on the virus’ spread.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.6">It’s unclear when the Sounders may play again. The pandemic drove the XFL into bankruptcy. One <a href="http://blogs.shu.edu/sportspoll/2020/04/09/nearly-3-of-4-americans-say-they-wont-attend-games-without-coronavirus-vaccine-developed/">recent poll</a> found that more than 70% of Americans won’t feel safe going to a sporting event until there is a coronavirus vaccine.</p>

<h3>Memo to America’s Governors:</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0"><strong>From:</strong> ProPublica</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1"><strong>Subject:</strong> Restarting the Economy</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">After insisting that he had absolute power to decide when to reopen the American economy, President Donald Trump has turned over to all of you what he initially called “the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">Trump is often guilty of hyperbole, but he’s right in this case. Figuring out how and when to let people go back to work during an outbreak of life-threatening disease is the most consequential decision any of you will ever face. You’ve already seen the stakes in New York, New Jersey and Michigan. Get this wrong and thousands of people in your state will die. As the presidential election campaign heats up, count on the president to blast you for high unemployment rates in your state (you lifted restrictions too slowly) or clusters of deaths (you went too far, too soon).</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">To help you and your aides think about this decision over the next few weeks, we’ve interviewed experts and frontline officials from Italy, Germany, Spain, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea. While they differ on the details, their views formed a startlingly united consensus of what’s needed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Massive, ongoing testing to detect where the disease is spreading,</li>
<li>a real-time ability to trace contacts of those infected and isolate them,</li>
<li>a willingness of people to wear masks in crowded public spaces,</li>
<li>reserves of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other equipment for hospital workers to handle any surge in cases,</li>
<li>and reliable, easily administered blood tests to find out the number of people who have been infected. If they work well, such tests could eventually be used to identify people with immunity who could work at higher-risk jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">We also asked American experts whether states can meet all or most of these benchmarks. Their answers coalesced around a single point: None of you are close to being ready.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">There were differences among the people we interviewed about tactics and strategy. Some saw promise in the smartphone-based tools that would allow disease detectives to quickly find people with whom an infected person was in close contact. Others doubted that a critical mass of Americans would ever let the government track their movements, whatever promises were made about privacy.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">One theme emerged again and again. Experts from across the world said it’s crucial to correctly interpret the recent drop in the rate of hospitalizations and deaths reported by New York City, ground zero for the epidemic. This result was achieved only by a month of slamming the brakes on the economy and banning the most basic interactions (and pleasures) of human society.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">The bad news, they said, is that everything we’ve been through so far has merely allowed us to reset the clock to mid-January, when the virus was already seeded in many parts of America and we were on the cusp of the biggest public health crisis in a century. Allow people to return to offices, streets, malls and mass transit without a well-thought-out plan, and you stand a substantial chance of triggering a second wave of infections.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">Reopening is essential to save the economy, they said, but don’t kid yourself: The new normal will look nothing like the old normal. Until there’s a vaccine or a reliable treatment, you and your states will be living and working very differently, constantly at risk from a wave of disease that could overwhelm your hospitals. You may borrow ideas from Asia and Europe that would have been unimaginable a few months ago: Isolating infected people from their families in hotels, requiring masks for everyone on a bus or subway, ordering restaurants to seat people at every other table, limiting certain jobs to people who have proven immunity to the virus.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">“We have to all acknowledge that we will have to live with Corona for at least a year and probably two or three years,” said Dr. Ansgar Lohse, a professor at University Medical Center in Hamburg and co-author of a <a href="https://www.ifo.de/DocDL/Coronavirus-Pandemic_Strategy.pdf">paper</a> that sets out a “flexible, risk-adjusted strategy” for reopening commerce in Germany.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">“All of our societies will have to adapt to this challenge, and this will be different in different societies,” Lohse said in an interview. “Even in a country like Germany, we will have to regionally and locally and also probably seasonally adapt the strategy.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">America’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/14/coronavirus-testing-delays-186883">continuing inability</a> to roll out widespread testing means you’re flying blind on the most pivotal questions. How many people in your state have already had the virus? The percentage is almost certainly in single digits, but there may be pockets in which more significant numbers of people have been exposed and have immunity.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">You can assume that upwards of 90% of your state remains vulnerable to infection from a single sneeze or cough by someone standing or sitting near them. A single highly contagious person in a crowded space can start a chain of disease that quickly encompasses dozens if not hundreds of people.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">“It’s like after a forest fire,” said Jerome Kim, director general of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul. “There are still embers and warm spots on the ground. If you drop a gallon of gas on top of that, the fire will restart.”</p>

<h3>1. Build an Army of Contact Tracers</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3">Without exception, every expert we talked to stressed the imperative of being able to know exactly where the virus is spreading. That sounds incredibly obvious and basic, but comes with demanding logistics that few — if any — states are able to carry out right now.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">By now, we know that the virus has been relentlessly effective at spreading itself through a population because people are highly contagious in the first few days of their illness, often <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/what-we-need-to-understand-about-asymptomatic-carriers-if-were-going-to-beat-coronavirus">before they start to experience symptoms</a>. The only way to track the spread of the virus, then, is to maintain a massive army of “contact tracers” who can track down the contacts of anyone who tests positive.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.1">Places that have been most successful in slowing the spread of the virus, such as Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore (at least initially), have been relentless in tracking down the contacts of every infected person, testing them and then instructing people who aren’t infected to self-isolate and monitor their own symptoms.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.2">“It usually takes four or five people over three days to do one full contact trace, on average,” said Andy Slavitt, former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the Obama administration. California, which has a population of 40 million people, could need anywhere from “several thousand to 20,000” contact tracers, depending on the number of cases and how fast the virus is spreading, Slavitt said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.3">Wuhan, China, a city of 11 million, employed more than <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/a-national-plan-to-enable-comprehensive-COVID-19-case-finding-and-contact-tracing-in-the-US.pdf">9,000 contact tracers</a>, split into 1,800 teams of five. In Shenzhen, a city just across the border from Hong Kong in southeastern China, contact tracers had identified 2,842 close contacts of coronavirus patients and found that 88 were infected, as of mid-February, according to a World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf">report</a>. That’s only 3%. But imagine what would have happened if all 88 had continued wandering around the city for the next several weeks.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">Technology has been used by some countries to supplement the detailed human interviews. In South Korea, the government swept up everyone’s cellphone and credit card information and used it to identify anyone who came physically close to an infected person.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.1">Kim, the director general of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul, is a former officer in the U.S. Army’s Medical Corps who has lived in Seoul for five years. He said the South Korean government has combined 21st-century technology and old-fashioned shoe leather to trace contacts.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.2">The initial outbreak of the virus was brought into the country by members of a church that had a branch in Wuhan, where the epidemic began in December. Soon, Korean authorities noticed that new cases were being seeded by international travelers, so they instituted a system in which people arriving from certain countries were met at the gate, tested and told to begin quarantine. A tracking app was put on their phones and over the next two weeks, they were asked to provide daily reports on their health. Authorities made at least one in-person visit to make sure they were healthy and following the rules.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.3">Korean law gives health officials access to anyone’s credit card purchases and cellphone location data during an outbreak, allowing disease trackers to identify and alert anyone who crossed paths with an infected person.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Here in the U.S., our legal framework and historic commitments to civil liberties preclude us from doing anything like this. Apple and Google are adding features to the operating systems of their smartphones so that they will create an encrypted record of every other phone you encounter. The system, which would require users to opt in, will use the Bluetooth technology that connects phones to cars, wireless headphones or speakers. People who test positive for COVID-19 can enter that information into their phone, and any users in recent contact with them will be alerted. It’s hard to say how many people would ultimately agree to participate, but if it’s less than a large percentage of the population, as is likely, the app probably won’t be of enormous use.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.1">Our reporting suggests that few major cities or states are yet prepared to do contact tracing at scale. New York City’s health department did not respond to a request for comment on the question of how many disease detectives it employs, but <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-disease-detectives-health-care-workers-20200322-fdn4rcw7sjdkdpv4rdf4ga5yay-story.html">The Daily News</a> reported last month that the city was hoping to triple the number from 50 to 150. The New York State Department of Health wouldn’t say how many contact tracers it currently has, noting that it is “actively working on a plan to greatly expand capacity at local and state levels to perform contact tracing.” Massachusetts has said it is <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly-coronavirus-special-edition/2020/04/13/open-and-shut-488897">hiring</a> and training 1,000 workers.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.2">Given the number of line cooks, waiters, airline flight attendants, mall employees and factory workers who are now unemployed, you might consider creating a contact tracing version of the WPA, the Depression-era employment program that bolstered society with projects like public roads, buildings, parks and art. Given that all of you are required to balance your budgets every year, paying the salaries of all these new public health workers is going to have to come out of your already-strapped budgets.</p>

<h3>2. Be Prepared to Test Constantly</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.3">We know you’re sick of hearing about it, but our experts agreed that the inability to do widespread testing for the virus is the central reason it has spread so widely in the U.S.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">As you look toward reopening, testing is going to be just as important. There are two types of tests, and you’ll need both of them at a massive scale.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.1">You’re already familiar with the first test, the one used to diagnose an active infection. While more and more have become available, there are still nowhere near enough. If you go to a system of contact tracing as described above, you’re going to need to test every single close contact of every infected person, not just those who are showing symptoms.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.2">In Italy, much has been made of the contrast between how the epidemic unfolded in Lombardy, a region of about 10 million, and neighboring Veneto, which has almost 5 million. Lombardy was the hottest of Italy’s hotspots, accounting for about 11,581 of the country’s estimated 22,745 deaths. Veneto, by contrast, has had only about 1,026 deaths, reflecting a very different approach to testing and tracing. Relatively early, authorities locked down the town of Vo Euganeo and began widespread testing of everyone, regardless of whether they had symptoms of the virus. The suspicion, later proven correct, was that asymptomatic carriers were spreading the disease. Carriers and their close contacts were isolated for 10 to 15 days.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">Different numbers have been thrown around for what sort of diagnostic test capacity the U.S. would need to fully reopen. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under Trump, has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/07/former-fda-chiefs-outline-plan-to-reopen-the-economy-when-broad-testing-in-place-171344">suggested</a> testing everyone who visits a doctor, which would mean about 3.8 million tests per week. Slavitt, the former CMS administrator under Obama, calls for 10 million tests a week.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.1">We are nowhere near that capacity right now (we’re currently at about 1 million a week, <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily">according</a> to the COVID Tracking Project), due to shortages in the supply chain for all aspects of testing.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.2">It’s not just a lack of test kits, but also chemicals needed to run the tests, called reagents, collection tubes, swabs and other equipment like pipettes, explained Scott Becker, chief executive officer of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. “Many labs aren’t just running one instrument with one extraction platform and one kit, they’re using multiple, because it’s like whack-a-mole. When you run out of reagents for this one, you switch to that one,” Becker said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.3">One of the key indicators that you are testing widely enough is the rate at which people test positive. If a significant percentage of tests keep finding COVID-19, it means you’re likely still reserving tests for people with obvious symptoms and likely missing those who are asymptomatic.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.4">“If you’re at 15%, 20%, then you’re not testing enough,” according to <a href="https://www.aledade.com/our-team">Dr. Farzad Mostashari</a>, former National Coordinator for Health IT for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.5">Mostashari says a 5% positive rate would be appropriate as one metric for reopening, but he cautioned: “You have to be testing the right population. You can’t be like, I’m only testing asymptomatic basketball players and the positivity rate is less than 5%. It has to be everyone, including people coming in with cough and fever, and you still have that low positivity rate.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.6">A second test just coming online could be a game changer. It’s a blood test that measures whether you’ve been exposed to the disease and developed antibodies against it.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">With many diseases, like chickenpox, the presence of antibodies means you’re immune and can’t get the disease a second time. Here’s the issue, and it’s not a trivial one: This novel coronavirus is such a new organism, we don’t yet know if the antibodies from the first infection protect you against a second one. Furthermore, with the FDA <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/coronavirus-tests-are-being-fast-tracked-by-the-fda-but-its-unclear-how-accurate-they-are">rushing to green-light</a> tests and lowering the bar for validation, it’s unclear how accurate many of these diagnostics are.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.1">Let’s say the accuracy of these tests is ultimately validated by scientists and it is established that a certain level of antibodies guarantees immunity, at least for a while. It would then be possible to give people a quick blood test that would allow them to return immediately to work.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.2">One thing to keep in mind: While the models differ on specific numbers, all agree that coronavirus has so far infected just a small percentage of the more than 320 million people in America. Hundreds of millions of people nationwide, and the vast majority of your state’s citizens, still have no defense against this disease. This will be true until a vaccine is widely available, which probably won’t happen for more than a year, if we’re lucky.</p>

<h3>3. Isolate People With Suspected Infections From Their Families</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.3">This is a really tough one. It goes against everything your constituents treasure in our family-centered society. That said, what we’ve learned in Italy, Taiwan and now our country is sobering.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.4">In New York, health authorities’ initial approach to someone with a fever and dry cough was to send them home to “self-isolate” in a single room for 14 days. (There weren’t enough tests to confirm diagnoses in these cases.)</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.5">In many cases, the result was disastrous. The disease spread to the entire family, sometimes sickening multiple generations.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.6">It turns out that the average American, when asked to turn a room of their home or apartment into a sealed zone, falls well short of perfection.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.7">Yes, the person being quarantined is told to spend every waking (and nonwaking) hour behind closed doors, eat food left on a tray outside their door, and use a separate bathroom. But that goes against a lot of fundamental facts of life. Some people share single-room apartments. Many don’t have two bathrooms. And not everyone is meticulous about wiping down door handles or wearing gloves and masks when they wash dishes. The result, visible in city after city, has been horrifying stories about first one parent, then a second parent, then the children ending up dead or ill from sequential infections.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">Separating people from their families for 14 days is a very tough thing to do. It would be massively unpopular. But if you look at what worked and didn’t in Taiwan, Italy and Singapore, you can see why this is so essential.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.1">Sergio Romagnani, an immunologist at the University of Florence, said the traditional, multigenerational closeness of Italian families played a role in spreading the disease. “In Italy, there is a lot more mixing of young people and elderly relatives,” he said. “Kids have a lot of contact with their grandparents, and in this case that caused deaths.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.2">Romagnani noted that authorities in Tuscany had begun putting infected people in hotels, which would ordinarily be filled with people visiting one of the world’s most beautiful tourist destinations. “It’s a good idea,” he said. “The hotels make some money since they are all closed. And you have isolation, which is necessary.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.3">Dr. C. Jason Wang, director of Stanford University’s Center for Policy, Outcomes and Prevention, said Taiwan has been a leader in isolating infected people from their families. The government pays hotel owners as much as $200 a night to house people under quarantine, providing three meals a day, a book to read and a stipend roughly equivalent to a young person’s daily salary. Anyone caught breaking quarantine faces a massive fine.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.4">Wang said Taiwan learned from the 2003 outbreak of SARS, when people who were forced to isolate thought they were being jailed, and ran away. “We learned that when you put people in quarantine, you need to be very nice to them.” Now, patients are checked by health workers three times a day. “If a person gets sick, their symptoms worsen, they will make sure they get care,” he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.5">While in the U.S., it may be impossible to force people to isolate away from their homes, “I think you can say, ‘Hey, wouldn’t you like to protect your family, and we prepared a nice room at the Hilton for two weeks for you, and you don’t need to pay for it.’ and you know, hopefully people will,” said Slavitt, who is now hosting a new podcast about the pandemic, “<a href="http://www.westwoodonepodcasts.com/pods/in-the-bubble-with-andy-slavitt/">In the Bubble</a>.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.6">Slavitt added that to pull this off, the federal government would need to provide funding to help pay for hotels.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">Here’s some incentive for you: Xihong Lin, a Harvard biostatistician, and colleagues in China found that when the outbreak began in Wuhan, the average person was infecting 3.86 other people. When the city closed businesses and imposed the sorts of social distancing measures that we now have in New York and California, the number of people infected by each person dropped to 1.26, which is good, but not good enough. (You need to get below 1 to get things under control and even consider restarting the economy.) When China got really tough, locking down every resident, isolating suspected cases in dorms and hotels and vigorously tracing contacts, it dropped to 0.32. Here’s Lin’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ9KIO1eXTA">webinar</a> on the group’s findings, if you’re curious to learn more.</p>

<h3>4. Protect, Protect, Protect Health Care Workers</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.1">If we are lucky enough to get the infection rate below epidemic levels in New York and elsewhere, there are still going to be people who get infected.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.2">One of the lessons from Wuhan and Italy is that you have to be utterly meticulous about protecting doctors and nurses. If you don’t, the hospitals become a vector for infection and you lose the frontline people you need to treat the sick.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.3">There’s another problem with not protecting your doctors and nurses: If you need them to handle a second wave of infections, even a smaller one, they may <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-nurses-hospital-wouldnt-let-her-wear-an-n95-mask-she-hasnt-been-back-to-work-in-weeks">stop coming to work</a>. Many are showing up right now out of a sense of duty and mission. But none of these people signed up for their profession with the idea that they would be risking their lives on a minute-by-minute basis. These are not combat infantry troops, and if they don’t believe they have appropriate personal protective equipment, there’s every reason to believe that some of them will simply quit.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">While the Chinese have revised their numbers more than once, leading to some hesitation over how much we can trust their reporting, there are still lessons we can learn from their experience. As of late February, the joint WHO-China mission <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf">reported</a> 2,055 cases of COVID-19 among health care workers, the vast majority, 88 percent, were at hospitals in Hubei province where the outbreak began. It appears that after the initial disaster in Wuhan, in which a doctor who raised the alarm died, the hospitals figured out what they needed to do to protect their medical workers.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.1"><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/24/covid-19-answers-doctors-turn-to-china/">This story</a> describes how Johns Hopkins doctors consulted with Chinese colleagues about best practices. Wuhan hospitals, after being hit with a wave of deaths and infections, asked staff members to check that each other’s gear was being used correctly. They worked four-hour shifts to prevent fatigue. A committee helped support the children and elderly parents of the health care workers.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.2">The past few weeks have already inflicted a powerful psychological blow on your state’s health care workers. To bolster their morale and keep them at work, you need to make a commitment to protecting their health. That means stockpiling an enormous supply of gowns, N95 masks, gloves and goggles. This is not optional. If you don’t have enough equipment set aside, don’t even think about restarting the economy. Lose the trained health care workers and it’s game over.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.3">Obviously, this stockpile should also include ventilators, oxygen, the drugs needed for intubation and all the other stuff that should have been waiting in reserve back in January when we had our first bite at this apple. But you know that already.</p>

<h3>5. Normal Is Not the Goal</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.4">One question we asked the experts we interviewed is: What would it take to put <a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/">5.4 million</a> people back on the New York City subway every day? Invariably, they all said: masks.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.5">Masks, especially when we’re talking about home-made ones, are not going to be perfect at preventing infection, but they can help reduce transmission. “Face masks are the only option in situations where social distancing can not be practiced,” said Lohse, from University Medical Center in Hamburg.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.6">In Madrid, police handed out masks for riders on public transit as Spain announced a partial return to work in certain sectors of the economy, including heavy industry and construction, on April 13.</p>

                    <p class="dek">The IRS is responsible for dispersing coronavirus stimulus checks to Americans who qualify and has started doing so as of mid-April 2020. But for many people, lots of questions lie between them and their “checks.” Here’s what you need to know.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">“We would probably go with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-austria-masks/austrian-supermarkets-hand-out-face-masks-before-they-become-compulsory-idUSKBN21J5Y9">Austria</a> in forcing the population to wear masks more widely, maybe in retail outlets, maybe in factories,” said Gabriel Felbermayr, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and economic advisor for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, talking about what Germany’s plans for reopening its own society.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.1">“We should have learned right away from the Asian experience, that was a huge mistake,” said Romagnani, in Florence. “But in the beginning, our authorities actually told people not to wear masks. They said, ‘Masks don’t do anything.’ Well, they were saying that because they didn’t have enough masks. They feared a stampede to buy them. They worried about price-gouging.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.2">In the United States, our surgeon general initially did much the same thing, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/29/health/face-masks-coronavirus-surgeon-general-trnd/index.html">tweeting</a> on Feb. 29 that masks are “NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus.” This week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered New York residents to wear face coverings in public whenever social distancing is not possible.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.3">The international experts’ responses were a reminder that your goal isn’t to get back to a pre-pandemic way of life, but instead to employ whatever tools it takes to keep transmission as low as possible while restarting your economy. Things like masks, temperature checks and maintaining a six-foot distance are new concepts for the U.S., and many of your constituents are going to find them weird, uncomfortable and unappealing. It’s worth your time helping them understand why these measures are so necessary, because you’ll save lives.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">One aspect of returning to normal is certain to arise in the coming months: Do you reopen schools? Early reports that COVID-19 can endanger only older people with other serious health problems have been demolished as the virus spread across the globe. The numbers are tiny, but infants, toddlers and teenagers have died from this disease. School closings, of course, were seen as a way of protecting older people, the assumption being that kids with mild or asymptomatic cases would infect their teachers, parents or grandparents.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.1">Taiwan is one of a handful of countries in the entire world that have kept their schools open. In February, it adopted <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3878803">rules</a> that require closing any school for 14 days if two or more cases are detected.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.2">Singapore’s Dr. <a href="https://sph.nus.edu.sg/faculty-directory/hsu-li-yang/">Li Yang Hsu</a>, said reopening schools is a plausible step. Hsu noted that countries tracing the “index,” or initial case, in a disease cluster have found few instances that trace to school-age children, “which is unusual for a respiratory virus.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.3">Hsu, program leader of infectious diseases at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said in an email that recent studies “seem to suggest that the impact of school closures is far less compared to other physical distancing measures. Therefore, provided nothing changes, the general conditions,” for resuming school “would be similar to that of reopening mass transit and other services.”</p>

<h3>6. Keep Your Eyes Peeled for the Second Wave</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">The initial success stories in fighting COVID-19 — Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea — all saw a rise in cases in March. Nearly all of these involved travelers who brought the infection from other countries and came into contact with locals. Remember, even once you get the number of new cases caused by each infected person below 1, you still have a population largely composed of people with no immunity, so you have to maintain constant vigilance to <em>keep</em> the rate low.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.1">We’re going to need a national system of the sort we should have had in the first place. Epidemiologists call it sentinel surveillance, and what it used to mean was that we would watch out for people with flu-like symptoms for signs of a new pandemic-type illness like H1N1.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.2">Even though we knew the coronavirus was coming, and even though epidemiology experts wanted to start sentinel surveillance in major cities like Seattle, New York and San Francisco by early February, it never happened because the CDC <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/cdc-coronavirus-covid-19-test">bungled the design</a> of the tests. Your state will need to get this right. Not only do we need to be testing constantly, but we should also be using all the tools we can to pick up any suspicious patterns of flu-like illness, whether that’s Google searches or heightened temperatures on web-linked thermometers, besides the traditional surveillance apparatus that public health departments already have.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">Here’s the tough reality for people hoping to go back to the old normal and, say, sit in a stadium and watch Tom Brady try to defy Father Time as a Tampa Bay Buccaneer: There are some things — no, there are a lot of things — in which the crowds are too large and tightly packed to be safe. NASCAR races? Baseball stadiums packed with 50,000 people? NBA playoffs? Ballet? Broadway? Hard to imagine putting that many people close together without a vaccine or unimpeachable proof that people have antibodies that make them immune. (You’d still have to find an impossible-to-counterfeit, non-transferrable form of ID so that only fans with antibodies would be admitted to large events. Good luck figuring out how to do that.)</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.1">It’s sad to say this, but until there’s a way to verify immunity, or a vaccine, you can’t allow visitors back into nursing homes. The elderly are just too vulnerable, and we’ve seen over and over how the virus just tears through those settings.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.2">You should keep an eye on Wuhan. The extra hospitals are closed, the extra 40,000 health care workers have gone home, and the city is slowly going back to work. If there’s no second wave in Wuhan, this might just work out. On the other hand, if the virus kicks up again despite everything they’ve done and are doing, hitting that restart button becomes a lot more complicated.</p>

<h3>7. Clear Communication Is Critical</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.3">There are an array of political skills that get you elected governor in America. Some of you built reputations as nuts-and-bolts technocrats, good at getting things done but not given to stirring oratory. Others have a gift for explaining complicated issues in ways that can move ordinary people to action. Several of you have run for president.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.4">One thing that came through in many of our interviews around the world was the importance of communicating clearly and consistently about the actions you take. China was able to take draconian steps to contain the Wuhan outbreak because it is a single-party state with virtually unlimited powers.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">You will need comparable levels of commitment from your citizenry, but will have to achieve it through persuasion rather than coercion.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.1">Manuel Gimenez, the minister of Economy and Employment for the regional government of Madrid, said that Spanish leaders were able to articulate reasons for one of the strictest lockdowns in the world in a country where congregating in cafes, restaurants and large family groups is an ingrained cultural tradition.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.2">For more than 45 days, Gimenez said, his 3-year-old and 8-month-old have not left his family’s 650-square-foot apartment, adhering to rules that require all children to remain indoors. Adults are permitted to go only to the nearest grocery store or pharmacy; exercising outdoors or walks for leisure are prohibited, and police have been enforcing the rules aggressively. Although at first there were complaints about people crowding parks and driving en masse to summer homes, over all the response has been remarkably disciplined.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.3">“What the Spanish government has done is send a series of messages preparing citizens for each phase of the response and the restrictive measures. This isn’t China,” said Miquel Porta, an epidemiologist at the Hospital del Mar in Barcelona. “In Spain, we had to communicate, accustom people to the idea of a lockdown, and create consensus. You can’t do what a dictatorship can do. The idea was disseminated that we are not staying home for ourselves. We are doing it for our fellow citizens.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.4">“The Spanish people have reacted well with great solidarity and even humor,” Porta said. “People shopping for the elderly, people singing on balconies. The media and the people have approved of the fact that scientists are telling them there is a certain amount of uncertainty and lack of knowledge in this crisis. Nobody is clear on how this is going to evolve.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">Stanford’s Wang said Taiwan learned this lesson in the wake of the country’s widely criticized response to SARS, a coronavirus that flared in Asia in 2003 but was ultimately brought under control and did not become a global pandemic.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.1">“In a democracy, we need to build trust and confidence so that when you say something to people, they’ll trust you and do what you say,” said Wang. “The communications part is critical and that’s what Taiwan did after SARS.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.2">As governors, you’re going to have to persuade voters to do things they won’t like at a moment of unparalleled partisan rancor, record unemployment, disarray in your state’s traditional media outlets and divisions among eminent scientists. Inevitably, you’re going to be using imperfect data to strike a balance between the possible loss of lives and the certain loss of jobs that keep food on the table of your state’s citizens. Remember when you thought battling the legislature and balancing the budget was hard?</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.3">This is much, much harder, and the clashing messages from the national level complicate things even more. The good news is that you have a better feel for your state’s character and quirks than any federal bureaucrat and are best equipped to figure out what your citizens can tolerate. Trump was right about one thing. These are the biggest decisions you’ll ever make. Good luck.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">On March 31, Florida emergency room nurse Naomi Moya took a big risk. Though her hospital didn’t allow staff to wear N95 masks when treating patients who were not diagnosed with the coronavirus, Moya brought one from home and put it on to protect herself.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">A supervisor noticed the N95 right away and ordered her to remove it.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">“I have my own supply,” Moya recalled saying. “It’s protection for me and you and my coworkers and the community and my family when I come home.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">The impasse was polite, but both sides held firm. Thus, at the height of a pandemic, when there’s a shortage of nurses, Moya stepped away. She and the hospital agreed that she would go on unpaid leave.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.4">Clinicians across the country are weighing similar choices when their hospitals lack the protective gear they believe they need to care for patients. A New Jersey doctor said she left her urgent care position because of safety concerns. “This is an unstable situation with a novel coronavirus with a company that could be protective but is not being adequately protective,” she said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.5">In North Carolina, Angela Allen said she watched warily as the coronavirus spread, waiting for her hospital to do something to protect the staff. Administrators considered the psychiatric unit where she works as a nurse “low risk,” Allen said. By mid-March, she said she asked for the staff to be tested for the coronavirus, so they could also be sure to avoid infecting the patients, and her manager said that wasn’t necessary. “If we can’t rule out that we are carriers then we have to assume that we are,” Allen said. “And if you’re not giving us the right equipment to at least protect our patients, then I can’t do my job.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.6">Allen said she didn’t quit but took a leave of absence and hasn’t been back since March 19.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">ProPublica spoke to 15 doctors and nurses from New Jersey to California to North and South Carolina who said their administrators have normalized poor infection control practices — putting them at risk and likely spreading the virus. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e6.htm?s_cid=mm6915e6_w">A study published Tuesday</a>by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that health care workers are getting infected at high rates, which also makes them a source of transmission.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">ProPublica and others have reported on <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-nurse-bought-protective-supplies-for-her-colleagues-using-gofundme-the-hospital-suspended-her">staff who were suspended</a> or fired for bringing their own gowns and masks and other protective equipment, or speaking up about it. But clinicians are saying there’s an even deeper problem. The conditions are so unsafe they’re being forced to choose between their livelihoods and risking their lives — and that means some are walking away.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">Moya works at AdventHealth Heart of Florida, a 193-bed facility in Davenport, near Orlando.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">AdventHealth did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about Moya. But it said in a statement that it does not have a shortage of N95 masks or other gear. Its statement said staff are not allowed to wear masks unless they are issued by the hospital, to ensure they are medical-grade and properly fitted. The N95 masks are provided to staff who care for suspected or known COVID-19 patients, the statement said.</p>

<h3>Lowering Infection Control Standards</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.4">In the upside-down world of American health care in the era of coronavirus, a nurse in an N95 is often considered both safe and defiant.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.5"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/UnderstandDifferenceInfographic-508.pdf">N95 masks are superior to surgical masks</a> for coronavirus protection, but like many hospitals, AdventHealth Heart of Florida has restricted their use.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.6">But the policy doesn’t account for the spread of disease by people who have not yet tested positive or who aren’t showing symptoms, Moya knew.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.7">“We know the disease process,” Moya said. “I don’t know who may be infected or not.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">The United States was caught so unprepared for the pandemic that hospitals don’t have enough N95 masks and other important gear. So facilities have been lowering their infection control standards — and demanding compliance from staffers.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">Moya had been prepared. She purchased her own N95 masks, and on that final day of March she put one on under the surgical mask AdventHealth had given her.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">When she was told to remove it, she got called to the office of the emergency department director, she said, who told her if she wore the N95 other staff would also want one. Also, the hospital didn’t want patients to feel scared by seeing everyone in a mask, Moya recalled the director saying.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">Moya is known for her calm demeanor, according to a nurse who works with her. She speaks English, Spanish and American Sign Language and is nonplussed by even the most aggressive patients.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.4">The problem isn’t just a lack of supplies, Moya and other clinicians who spoke to ProPublica said. The administrators are not acknowledging the hazards, causing a breakdown of trust.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.5">“They know this is real and that people are dying,” Moya said of her administration. “Would you send a firefighter into a burning building without appropriate gear?”</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">The Joint Commission, which establishes quality and safety standards for hospitals, accredits AdventHealth. It <a href="https://www.jointcommission.org/-/media/tjc/documents/resources/patient-safety-topics/infection-prevention-and-hai/covid19/public_statement_on_masks_from_home.pdf"> put out a statement</a> on March 31 — the same day Moya went on leave — supporting clinicians bringing their own face masks, including N95s, to work. “It is better to allow staff the opportunity to enhance their protection, even if the degree of that increased protection is uncertain,” the statement said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">Moya said she went on unpaid leave at great cost, having to defer her mortgage and car payments. She wants to return to her job. AdventHealth is a large organization that operates in nine states. It should be aware of the Joint Commission’s recommendations, she said. It’s also a Christian organization that pledges to “extend the healing ministry of Christ,” she said. So it should do better at the command to “love thy neighbor,” she said, when it comes to protecting its staff and patients.</p>

<h3>Clinicians Getting Silenced</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">Most of the clinicians who spoke to ProPublica would not speak on the record because they feared retaliation. They said their administrators have been changing policies to try and adapt to the pandemic. But the rules are often not consistent with what’s known about the virus.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3">A nurse in northern New Jersey said her hospital is reassigning staff to units for which they may not have adequate training. One supervisor suggested that refusing an assignment could result in a complaint against the nurse’s license, the nurse said. “My problem is they feel like they own us or something,” the nurse said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.4">Kate McLaughlin, a nurse who runs the advocacy organization NJ Safe Ratios, said she has heard of hospitals threatening to file complaints against nurses’ licenses if they quit or refuse to take assignments they consider unsafe. The intimidation “will make nurses reconsider whether they should come back to the bedside,” she said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.5">The widespread nature of retaliation against health care workers who complain about the lack of personal protective equipment led to the creation of <a href="http://beaconus.org/">Beacon</a>, a nonprofit advocacy organization in Massachusetts. Dr. Sejal Hathi, a co-founder of the group and a resident at Massachusetts General Hospital, said Beacon sent a letter Thursday to hospitals that had suspended or fired workers, demanding fair treatment and threatening legal action if they didn’t respect the rights of their staff. Health care workers are being forced to choose “between professional duty and personal safety,” Hathi said. “Those are competing ethical and existential obligations.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.6">Allen, the North Carolina nurse, works in a unit that’s part of the emergency room at Mission Hospital in Asheville. She has launched a website, <a href="https://theunmaskedrn.com/"> The Unmasked RN</a>, to give voice to nurses around the country who believe they are being muzzled. “We have executives making medical and scientific decisions without consulting the people who went to school for this,” she said.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">April Creamer, a behavioral health technician who works with Allen, said she is also thinking about leaving Mission Health because of the conditions. She’s been told the hospital has N95 masks, but the management doesn’t think they’re necessary in the psychiatric unit, she said. “For a while they were not providing us with any protection,” Creamer said. “They were ignoring the fact that COVID is a real thing.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.1">Mission Health spokeswoman Nancy Lindell said in a statement that “all our departments are appropriately equipped with hygiene supplies for both our staff and patients.” She did not address the specific concerns raised by Allen and Creamer.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.2">Many hospital executives say publicly they have the gear to keep their staff safe. But then their workers say they are not getting what they need.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.3">Mark O’Halla, president and CEO of Prisma Health in South Carolina, gave a reassuring message <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CowEsuZRQ3A&amp;t=15s">in an April 8 video</a>. “We have plenty of personal protective equipment to cover all of our employees and team members across the system,” he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.4">But two Prisma Health nurses who spoke to ProPublica said that has not been the case. Both the nurses said they have not been given N95 masks for use throughout their shifts and that staff have not been allowed to bring them from home. They said nurses have resigned because of the lack of protective equipment. Others were sent home with threats that they would be fired. Still others are looking for other jobs, the nurses said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.5">Prisma Health told ProPublica in a statement that it “is able to provide the appropriate personal protective equipment for treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.” Prisma has “sufficient stock of surgical masks” which are “deemed appropriate for COVID-19 patient contact excluding aerosol generating procedures,” the statement said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.6">Rick Boothman, who retired as chief risk officer for the University of Michigan Health System in 2018, said the coronavirus crisis is cracking open the fissures that sometimes exist between hospital administrators and clinicians. Health care providers are remarkably resilient, he said, and that’s allowed administrators to be too cavalier with them. “It’s unethical and immoral to shove somebody into harm’s way when that’s not what they signed up for,” Boothman said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.7">The administrators should be up front with the clinicians and tell them that they’re sorry, but the resources are limited and the challenge is at the doorstep, Boothman said. The leaders should tell the staff that they see that the safety situation is not optimal, he said, but that nobody will be pushed into an avoidably dangerous situation. Such an approach would build trust and be well received by doctors and nurses, he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.8">“I think you’d find an amazing number of people who would step up and not complain,” Boothman said.</p>

      <title>“Lawless” Wins Paul Tobenkin Award and Scripps Howard Impact Award</title>

                <p class="byline">
                by <a class="name" href="https://www.propublica.org/people/propublica">ProPublica</a>                </p>
                                                        
                

        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">Anchorage Daily News reporter Kyle Hopkins is the winner of this year’s Paul Tobenkin Memorial Award and Scripps Howard Impact Award. He was honored for his investigation “<a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/lawless">Lawless</a>,” a project of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network, which uncovered a sexual assault crisis in rural Alaska and how it is compounded by a profound lack of public safety services.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">The awards honored the work for its coverage of racial disparities, as well as for its real-world impact. “Lawless” was the first comprehensive investigation to lay bare Alaska’s failing, two-tiered criminal justice system. Its first story, based on more than 750 public records requests and interviews, found that <a href="https://features.propublica.org/local-reporting-network-alaska/alaska-sexual-violence-village-police/">one in three rural Alaska communities has no local law enforcement</a> of any kind. These indigenous communities are also among the most vulnerable in the United States, with the highest rates of sexual assault, suicide and domestic violence.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">The series’ second major installment found that dozens of Alaska communities, desperate for police of any kind, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/stebbins-alaska-cops-criminal-records-domestic-violence">hired officers convicted of felonies</a>, domestic violence, assault and other offenses that would make them ineligible to work in law enforcement or even as security guards anywhere else in the country. Next, Hopkins revealed how the state’s 40-year-old Village Public Safety Officer Program, designed to recruit villagers to work as lifesaving first responders, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-last-police-officer">has failed by every measure</a>. Alaska had quietly denied funding for basic recruitment and equipment costs for these unarmed village officers while publicly claiming to prioritize public safety spending.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">“Lawless” also exposed how the Alaska State Troopers agency, created to protect Alaska Native villages, instead <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/looking-for-alaskas-rural-police-force-check-the-suburbs">patrols mostly white suburbs</a> surrounding cities on the road system like Wasilla. That’s because residents in these highly populated regions — home to the current governor and former Gov. Sarah Palin — refuse to pay taxes for local law enforcement while rural areas pay the price. The series ended with a list of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/alaskas-law-enforcement-crisis-is-a-public-emergency-heres-how-experts-want-to-fix-it">six practical solutions to Alaska’s law enforcement crisis</a>, based on interviews with experts, combined with a dozen op-eds from village leaders, the Alaska congressional delegation and sexual assault survivors who offered additional ideas.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.4">The impact of the stories was dramatic, with tangible steps taken to address the crisis. After U.S. Attorney General William Barr declared the problems identified in our stories to be a public safety crisis, the U.S. Department of Justice pledged more than $52 million to provide public safety officers, training and infrastructure in Alaska villages. The U.S. attorney’s office announced it will add rural prosecutors, and Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced plans to hire 15 additional rural Alaska troopers — increasing the number of state law enforcement officers based directly in villages by 40% in 2020. In addition, the Alaska Police Standards Council has proposed changing state regulations that govern the hiring and screening of village police officers.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.5">The Daily News’ Loren Holmes, Bill Roth, Marc Lester, David Hulen, Alex Demarban, Michelle Theriault Boots and Tess Williams, as well as ProPublica’s Charles Ornstein, Adriana Gallardo, Beena Raghavendran and Nadia Sussman also contributed to the series.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.6">Administered by Columbia Journalism School, the Paul Tobenkin Memorial Award recognizes outstanding achievements in reporting on racial or religious hatred, intolerance or discrimination in the United States. ProPublica projects also won the Tobenkin Award in 2019 and 2018.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.7">The <a href="https://twitter.com/SH_Awards/status/1250940703171063811">Scripps Howard Impact Award</a> recognizes journalism that serves the public through coverage of an issue leading to changes in the public, private or business sector. This is the top award given by the Scripps Howard Foundation, honoring what the judges deemed to be the piece of journalism that had the greatest impact. Another ProPublica Local Reporting Network project, “<a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/a-911-emergency">A 911 Emergency</a>” by the Public’s Radio, was one of three finalists for the Impact Award.</p>

      <title>Without Federal Help, New York Doctors Had to Ask Medical Supply Execs for Dialysis Supplies</title>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">A month ago, the CEO of Baxter International Inc., one of the world’s top producers of fluids and other equipment used to treat kidney disease, told investors on an earnings call that while the company had started to see an uptick in orders for its dialysis products, it was, at the moment, “well equipped” to supply the world.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">But by early April, as COVID-19 patients were rushed into New York City hospitals at a breathtaking clip, kidney specialists throughout the epicenter of the country’s pandemic started frantically emailing one another about a critical shortage of dialysis supplies, highlighting a cruel and surprising feature of the disease for an unanticipated number of COVID-19 patients: acute kidney injury.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">The novel coronavirus, a respiratory illness, is damaging kidneys at a strikingly high rate, with preliminary studies estimating that between 14% and 30% of COVID-19 patients sick enough to wind up in the intensive care unit also experience kidney failure. And the resulting damage has taxed the supply of materials like fluids, cartridges and other machine components that are used to facilitate dialysis treatments that filter toxins out of sick patients’ bloodstreams continuously for 24 hours, called continuous renal replacement therapy, or CRRT.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">While a shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment to treat COVID-19 patients has dominated headlines in recent weeks, no such public conversation has played out in regard to dialysis supplies.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">Instead, nationally as in New York, the strain on the dialysis supply chain has touched off behind-the-scenes lobbying by doctors and their allies, who in recent weeks have made direct appeals to corporate executives at the industry’s two biggest players, both publicly traded, multinational corporations that produce the essential materials needed to treat patients whose kidneys are failing.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">“There’s been, as far as I can tell, no federal planning and no state planning on shortages for dialysis,” said Dr. David Charytan, director of the nephrology division at NYU Langone Health. “There’s a real failure to incorporate dialysis into any pandemic planning at a state or national level.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">This month, Dr. Donald Landry, the physician-in-chief at NewYork-Presbyterian, Columbia University Medical Center, called Bill Valle, the CEO of Fresenius Medical Care North America, after a mutual acquaintance provided him Valle’s cellphone number.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.4">“I said: ‘Things are really heating up. We really need your help,’” Landry said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.5">And on the night of Easter Sunday, following a flurry of weekend emails among members of the American Society of Nephrology and others, city doctors’ case for more supplies was made directly to company officials at Baxter. The call followed a public appeal by one city nephrologist, who <a href="https://twitter.com/jradnephro/status/1249092873284444164">took to Twitter</a> the day before to warn of looming disaster, writing: “Dire straits in NYC!!. Shortage of dialysis nurses, CRRT machines and fluids across all hospitals.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">The impetus for the urgent effort is evident in intensive care units across New York.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">In a paper currently under journal review titled “Impending Shortages of Renal Replacement Therapy for COVID-19 Patients” provided to ProPublica, top doctors affiliated with NYU Langone Health, Bellevue Hospital Center and the Department of Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Medical Center wrote that based on a preliminary analysis, between 20% and 30% of affected ICU patients had acute kidney injury that required CRRT.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">“Our efforts in the last weeks have led us to fear that another critical shortage may occur before that of ventilators: our ability to deliver renal replacement therapy (RRT) for patients severely affected by COVID-19,” they wrote. “Capacity for delivering RRT is stretched, to the point of nearly breaking.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">Whether the market is able to satisfy the need without federal intervention remains to be seen.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.4">A week after its March 17 earnings call, Baxter <a href="https://www.nutritioncare.org/uploadedFiles/Documents/Guidelines_and_Clinical_Resources/COVID19/Protective%20Allocation%20Letter%20USHP%20Renal%20032420%20FINAL.pdf">notified its customers</a> that it was imposing blanket restrictions on how much product customers could buy, limiting their purchases to a fixed percentage of their past orders. The policy, known in the industry as protective allocation, is meant to prevent stockpiling and ensures all customers get some of what they’re asking for.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.5">But for many city nephrologists, the policy didn’t account for the surge in demand New York ICUs were experiencing.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.6">“When we realized that supplies were getting really dangerously low, our first call was to the supplier,” said NYU’s Charytan. But because of the limits imposed by Baxter on purchase orders, the hospital wasn’t able to exceed the percentage allocated by the company. “Their policy was you can get 110% of your normal use, but we need 250%,” he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">The federal government can intervene to augment supply.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">This week, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/15/dialysis-kidney-coronavirus-188840">according to Politico</a>, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services discussed one potential solution: importing more dialysis fluid. And the Defense Production Act, first used during the Korean War, affords the president broad authority to intervene in the markets in the national defense by making companies manufacture certain material, keep material from leaving the country or seizing products and reallocating supply.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">The White House didn’t immediately respond to questions on Friday about whether the administration was considering use of the Defense Production Act for dialysis supplies.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3">“What they have at their fingertips, in order to accommodate it this week or next week, is redirection,” said Dr. Alan Kliger, a co-chair of the American Society of Nephrology’s COVID-19 task force, who helped coordinate the Easter weekend phone calls. But such a diversion of materials means other states or hospital systems expecting supplies won’t get them, he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.4">ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/in-desperation-new-york-state-pays-up-to-15-times-the-normal-price-for-medical-equipment">reported</a> this month that health care product distributors, fearful of being accused of collusion, have been reluctant to steer extra supplies to hard-hit states. Absent federal direction to companies about where supplies should go, states, cities and hospitals are left to lobby for what they need.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.5">But Dr. David Goldfarb, clinical director of the nephrology division at NYU, emphasized that the federal government could coordinate emergency manufacturing of dialysis supplies, rather than leaving it to the small set of companies already in the business. “Kidney fluid is not hard to make,” he told ProPublica. “Lots of people could make it.”</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">Dr. Barbara Murphy, chair of medicine for the Mount Sinai Health System, told ProPublica that the last-ditch effort to lobby companies for supplies underscores the need for concerted federal action. “It shouldn’t have to be individual division chiefs making calls,” she said. “There needs to be a national coordination of access to supplies and … how to allocate based on need.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.1">Lauren Russ, a spokeswoman for Baxter, said “there have been no discussions” about an order invoking the Defense Production Act for dialysis materials and the company had sent additional filter sets and fluids to New York hospitals following the Easter weekend calls. She said the company was experiencing up to five times its normal orders and defended the limits the company has imposed on purchase orders, saying they were formulated “to deliver our products where they are needed the most.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.2">Valle, the Fresenius North America CEO, said in a statement that the company had increased its manufacturing capacity and “implemented a national intensive renal care reserve to support continuous supply, particularly in markets most heavily impacted.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.3">Landry thanked Valle in an email this week for fulfilling an order of 55 machines, 10,000 boxes of a dialysis solution, and sending 12 specially trained nurses and technicians. “You helped save many lives, as surely as if you resuscitated them yourself,” he wrote.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.4">In addition to the sheer volume of patients sickened by the novel coronavirus, a shortage of nurses is also contributing to the strain on dialysis treatment. Dialysis therapies require specialized skills and are particularly labor intensive in a crisis where staffing is thin.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">What’s more, how COVID-19 actually affects the kidneys themselves may also account for the run on CRRT supplies.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.1">COVID-19 causes so much internal inflammation that when dialysis tries to pull out toxins from the bloodstream, the debris coats the membrane and clots it, said Dr. Ashita Tolwani, who heads the CRRT program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. That makes it hard for even routine blood thinners to stop coagulation and results in a need for more filters, pumps and other equipment. Autopsy reports show clots in the legs and lungs of COVID-19 patients who received 24-hour dialysis to stave off kidney failure, she said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.2">COVID-19 patients experiencing kidney disease often require weeks of dialysis even after they’ve been removed from ventilators, experts say.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.3">With limited resources, nephrologists in New York and throughout the country are coming up with shortcuts and makeshift solutions to a lack of needed supplies, including using regular dialysis machines and slowing them down to increase their hours of use in a practice known as shift therapy.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.4">ProPublica spoke to doctors at nine hospitals in the city, including Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens and Bellevue in Manhattan, who described strains on the dialysis treatment for COVID-19 patients there and workarounds hospital staff had come up with to ensure care.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.5">But the piecemeal approach has frustrated doctors on the front lines, who are reliant on private industry to urgently provide critical equipment during a public health crisis without much guidance from the government.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.6">“Our staff has really been heroic, and the nurses too,” NYU’s Charytan told ProPublica. “But if we run out of options for fluid, there will be nothing we can do.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">As President Donald Trump publicly bashed the World Health Organization over its response to the coronavirus pandemic last week, American aid officials tried to delicately sidestep the political tensions, internal documents shared with ProPublica show.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">And Trump’s campaign upended weeks of partnership between his own administration and the WHO, which provides advice and support for health officials in developing countries. The U.S. Agency for International Development had chosen to funnel much of its pandemic response through the WHO.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">Even as they dealt with the fallout of Trump’s decision to cut off WHO funding, his administration leaned on it for expert advice.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">The April 10 comment on the document prompted a rebuttal a few days later from another career official, one of many who argued that the WHO’s role in the health crisis should not be caught up in a political spat.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">“It’s actually important to reference WHO standards during this type of emergency pandemic response - even with current political dynamics,” wrote the official, who argued for leaving in the mention of the WHO. It’s unclear which wording made it into the final version of the document.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">The exchange was just one example of the angst that spread throughout USAID as it became clear that Trump would follow through with his April 10 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-24/">threat</a> to cut off WHO funding, and it was indicative of efforts by officials to downplay the role of an important public health partner. Just a few days later, on Tuesday, Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing/">paused</a> all U.S. funding for the WHO, upending crucial plans for containing the virus in developing countries and bolstering China’s narrative that it is stepping into the traditional U.S. role of global leader.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">Interviews with current and former U.S. officials and the internal documents and communications show that despite Trump’s recent disparagement of the WHO, his administration was for weeks relying heavily on its expertise and global reach to fight the pandemic. And in a public relations battle between China and the U.S. over global leadership, American diplomats and aid officials have cited robust U.S. funding of the WHO as a key supporting argument.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">The WHO’s expertise is a critical resource for developing countries that lack their own strong public health sectors, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former USAID official during the Obama administration. Cutting the WHO out of funding means the U.S. is eliminating its own ability to control the pandemic in those countries, he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">“If you want to try and fight a public health crisis in a developing country without the WHO, you are lost from the outset,” Konyndyk said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">Particularly in conflict zones where the U.S. has limited or no reach, such as Syria, Yemen and Libya, working with the WHO is crucial, one U.S. official said on the condition of anonymity.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3">Just one day after Trump’s announcement, on Wednesday, WHO staff held a presentation for USAID’s Global Health Bureau on health care in conflict settings, according to a description of the meeting seen by ProPublica.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">USAID and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.1">A State Department spokesperson said the halt to WHO funding “in no way diminishes U.S. leadership on global health matters, including the current COVID crisis. We have ample ability to provide aid ourselves or through other partners to fight the pandemic, and we will continue to do so.” The spokesperson declined to be named.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.2">The WHO referred ProPublica to <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-audio-emergencies-coronavirus-press-conference-15apr2020.pdf?sfvrsn=1b9ed28d_2">comments</a> on Wednesday by its director general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saying that his organization hopes the U.S. will continue to be a “generous friend” and that his agency “works to improve the health of many of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.3">The State Department and USAID turned to the WHO soon after the agencies received nearly $1.3 billion in new funding from Congress to address the pandemic in March. That funding had few strings attached, meaning officials could disburse it largely as they saw fit and did not have to channel it through the WHO or any other specific entity.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.4">In a March <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6841795-Section-406-Report.html">memo</a> outlining the administration’s global pandemic response, obtained by ProPublica, officials wrote that the U.S. would work “in close coordination with” the WHO. Several strategy elements mentioned the WHO.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">In a March 31 public <a href="https://www.state.gov/the-u-s-role-in-international-organizations-response-to-covid-19/">statement</a>, the State Department highlighted U.S. assistance to the WHO, boasting that the agency’s “broad-based effort would not be possible without U.S. support.” The statement made repeated swipes at China, comparing U.S. funding of multilateral organizations to China’s much lower contributions.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.1">That view was also reflected in an internal document dated April 13 and titled “Countering People’s Republic of China (PRC) Propaganda on Health and Humanitarian Aid.” It cited “critical support” from the U.S. to “the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Food Program and dozens of other organizations.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.2">Internal State Department guidance sent in early April, with diplomatic talking points about U.S. assistance, encouraged “Ministries of Health to reach out to the local WHO representative and other local partners to inquire about laboratory test kits, reagents, and supplies, laboratory supplies, and test kit availability in your region.”</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">The guidance also served as an endorsement of the WHO’s unique capabilities. “WHO uses existing agreements and its vast network of procurement mechanisms to purchase tests on behalf of countries that cannot afford them,” it said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.1">The U.S. quickly funneled nearly $700,000 each to <a href="https://ma.usembassy.gov/u-s-provides-additional-assistance-to-morocco-to-respond-to-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/">Morocco</a> and <a href="https://iq.usembassy.gov/u-s-provides-additional-assistance-to-iraq-to-respond-to-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/">Iraq</a> via the WHO last month. In response to a White House query this week, USAID officials compiled information on several grants they had made to the WHO that were supporting coronavirus relief and detection efforts in South Africa, India, Angola and elsewhere, according to a spreadsheet seen by ProPublica.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.2">U.S. officials working on the response said they now worry about how they can help countries if they can’t channel the assistance via the WHO.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.3">“For several countries, the WHO is the only way we can help them,” one official said. “We know nothing about anyone else who’s operating there.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.4">The significant U.S. reliance on the WHO in the Middle East prompted officials in the State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-officials-warned-against-halting-funding-to-who-leaked-memo-shows">write a memo</a> to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warning of the consequences of a funding halt. The memo, a draft version of which was seen by ProPublica, warned of undermining the global response to the pandemic, threatening American lives, and ceding ground to China.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">Indeed, Trump officials have been preoccupied with the idea that China is winning the global PR battle. On Thursday morning, White House, State Department, USAID and Pentagon officials held a conference call to discuss the issue, focusing on the Middle East. Several diplomats in the region said that talking points against China gain little traction in their countries, according to someone with knowledge of the call.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.1">Privately, USAID officials acknowledge that China is well ahead of the U.S. in pushing the narrative that it is the leading humanitarian actor responding to the pandemic, according to meeting notes and emails seen by ProPublica.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.2">One U.S. embassy in North Africa reported to officials in Washington this week that the Chinese had until recently avoided bashing the U.S. in favor of boosting their own donations of medical equipment. There was one exception, they noted: The Chinese took the opportunity to highlight the U.S. decision to halt funding to the WHO.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">At the end of March, the federal government passed a $2.2 trillion bipartisan emergency coronavirus relief package, offering some of the most hard hit a much needed stopgap. The legislation includes small business loans and coronavirus stimulus checks for low- and middle-income Americans.</p>

<h3>Will I get a coronavirus stimulus emergency check?</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">You should receive a coronavirus stimulus check <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center">if you meet all of the following criteria</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a Social Security number.</li>
<li>You are a U.S. citizen or legal immigrant.</li>
<li>You are not claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return.</li>
<li>You make less than $99,000 as an individual, $136,500 as a head of household or $198,000 as a married couple who filed their taxes jointly.</li>
<li>You have filed or will file your 2018 or 2019 taxes; are taking Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Insurance or Railroad Retirement benefits; or if you legally are not required to pay income tax (known as a “non-filer”), you give basic information to the IRS via the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here">“Non-filers: Enter Payment Info Here” tool</a>. More for “non-filers” below.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How much will I receive?</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">How much you will receive depends on your income. You will receive the full stimulus check amount of $1,200 if you made less than $75,000 as an individual or $112,500 as a head of household. Married couples who filed their taxes jointly and made less than $150,000 will receive $2,400.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">Parents will also receive an additional $500 for each qualifying child — that is, children <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/morning-show/2020/04/09/50-million-americans-to-receive-first-pay-out-of-stimulus-checks-today/">under 17</a> who are claimed as dependents.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">Individuals who made between $75,000 and $99,000, married couples who made between $150,000 and $198,000, and heads of households who made between $112,500 to $136,500 will receive a reduced stimulus check. The payment amount is reduced by $5 for every $100 made above the $75,000 threshold for individuals, $112,500 threshold for a couple or $150,000 for heads of household. The cutoff range is higher for those with kids, according to IRS spokesperson Eric Smith, who encourages recipients to use an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/">online calculator like this easy-to-use option from The Washington Post</a>.</p>

<h3>When will I get the check?</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">The IRS will begin sending money via direct deposit first. It started sending out the “checks” via direct deposit the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-irs-launch-new-tool-to-help-non-filers-register-for-economic-impact-payments">week</a> of April 13, 2020 and will continue to send them throughout the summer. Most eligible Americans will have received their payments by April 17, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/04/09/stimulus-check-dates/#10eee755588c">according</a> to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. If the IRS put your refund (from 2018 or 2019) into a bank account — that’s how you’ll get the money.</p>

</p>
            
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">If you did not get a tax refund and instead owed money, you can <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center">read eligibility requirements</a> and <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment">check on the status of your payment on the IRS website</a>. The IRS may need more information from you on where to send the check.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.1">The first paper checks will be sent on April 24 to the lowest-income Americans who make $10,000 or less, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/irs-to-begin-issuing-1200-coronavirus-payments-april-9-but-some-americans-wont-receive-checks-until-september-agency-plan-says/2020/04/02/8e0cfc84-751e-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html">reporting</a> by the Post. On May 1, paper checks will be sent to Americans making between $10,000 and $20,000, on May 8, to Americans making $20,001 to $30,000, and so forth.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.2">You can find out more about how you will get the money by using the IRS’ <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment">“Filers: Get My Payment” tool</a>.</p>

<h3>How do I sign up to receive a stimulus check?</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.3">The IRS will automatically determine your eligibility and calculate your check. There is no need to sign up if you submitted your 2018 or 2019 tax return or are taking Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/supplemental-security-income-recipients-will-receive-automatic-economic-impact-payments-step-follows-work-between-treasury-irs-social-security-administration">Supplemental Security Income</a> or Railroad Retirement benefits; you will automatically be sent money.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">If you do not fall into the above categories and are not what the IRS considers a “non-filer,” you will need to submit your 2019 tax return.</p>

<h3>Do I have to use a tax preparer like TurboTax or H&amp;R Block to get my check?</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.1">No. If the IRS does not have tax information on you and you do not have to pay taxes, you can sign up at this IRS page: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here">“Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here”</a></p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.2">If you are required to pay taxes, the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment">“Filers: Get My Payment” tool</a> lets you check the status of your stimulus check, including where and when it will be sent.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.3">The IRS stimulus product is built by Intuit, the maker of TurboTax. On April 15, ProPublica published a look at the company’s competing <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/millions-of-americans-might-not-get-stimulus-checks-some-might-be-tricked-into-paying-turbotax-to-get-theirs">“stimulus registration product.”</a> Though the product is marketed as “free,” we found multiple trap doors leading users to paid products. Also, TurboTax users <a href="https://www.intuit.com/privacy/data-usage/">sign away their personal data</a> to the Silicon Valley firm, which the company can <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/millions-of-americans-might-not-get-stimulus-checks-some-might-be-tricked-into-paying-turbotax-to-get-theirs">use</a> to pitch third-party financial products to its customers.</p>

<h3>What if I didn’t file my taxes?</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.4">You will need to submit your 2019 tax return UNLESS you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Receive Social Security</li>
<li>Receive <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/supplemental-security-income-recipients-will-receive-automatic-economic-impact-payments-step-follows-work-between-treasury-irs-social-security-administration">Supplemental Security Income</a></li>
<li>Receive Social Security Disability Insurance benefits</li>
<li>Are a railroad retiree</li>
<li>Are a “non-filer”</li>
</ul>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.5">There are many ways to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-to-file-state-federal-taxes-free-2020">file for free</a> with the IRS’ <a href="https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free">Free File program</a>. The <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/what-is-the-new-deadline-to-file-taxes-a-coronavirus-update">deadline for federal income taxes has been pushed back from April 15 to July 15, 2020</a>.</p>

<h3>What if I’m not legally required to file my taxes?</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.6">If you are a legal non-filer, you two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.7">You can register for economic impact payments via the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here">Treasury Department and the IRS’ new “Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info” web tool</a>. You will need to provide <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here">basic personal information</a> such as your birthdate, Social Security number, and the names and ages of your dependents. People who are not legally required to file a tax return <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here">include</a> individuals who made less than $12,200 or married couples who made less than $24,400 in 2019.</p>

</li>
<li><p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.8">You can file your taxes via <a href="https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free">the IRS Free File options</a> — which are free — and you may be eligible for a refund, too.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.9">Those taking Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income or Railroad Retirement benefits will receive $1,200 checks without having to file a tax return. However, if you have dependents under the age of 17 and have not filed a tax return, you will want to register via the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here">IRS’ “Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info” web tool</a> to receive the additional $500 per qualifying child.</p>

<h3>Will the check be sent to my address?</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.10">If you provided your direct deposit information when you filed your taxes AND received a tax refund, the IRS will deposit the check directly to your bank account. Otherwise, it will send a paper check to the address you last used to file taxes, even if you do not live there.</p>

</p>
                        
<h3>The IRS doesn’t have my bank account information. How can I get my check sooner?</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">The IRS’ <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment">“Get My Payment” tool</a> allows you to provide the government with your direct deposit information, so you won’t have to wait for a paper check and can get your money deposited to your bank account immediately.</p>

<h3>What if I qualify for a stimulus check but owe the IRS money?</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.1">These checks are being treated differently than your tax return. You will still receive the stimulus check even if you owe money to <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/banks-can-grab-stimulus-check-pay-debts/">federal or state agencies</a>, with some exceptions like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/coronavirus-stimulus-check-questions-answers-2020-4">outstanding child support</a>.</p>

<h3>Is this a loan? Is it an advance on next year’s tax refund? Will I have to pay taxes for the stimulus check next year?</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.2">No, no and no. The stimulus check is a no-strings-attached payment.</p>

<h3>What if I qualify for the stimulus check based on my 2018 tax return but don’t qualify based on my 2019 tax return?</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.3">The stimulus check will be based off of the most recent tax return you filed.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.4">If you filed your 2018 taxes but have not filed your 2019 taxes, you can wait to file your 2019 taxes until you receive the check. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/what-is-the-new-deadline-to-file-taxes-a-coronavirus-update">But don’t miss the new July 15 deadline to file your taxes</a>; taxpayers who file late will still face penalties and fees. The longer you wait to file your taxes, the longer it takes to receive your tax refund.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">A Chicago psychiatric hospital that has faced repeated allegations of abuse and neglect of patients has closed, although a spokesman for the hospital said Friday the move is temporary.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">Once one of the largest behavioral health providers in Illinois, Chicago Lakeshore Hospital in Uptown discharged its last patient this week and notified employees of the closure, the spokesman said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">“Chicago Lakeshore Hospital has temporarily discontinued providing services,” said Guy Chipparoni, a spokesman for Signature Healthcare Services, which owns Chicago Lakeshore Hospital. “Skeletal staff” remain at the hospital, he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">The hospital cited COVID-19 in its decision to close, but Lakeshore was under scrutiny long before the current pandemic. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/chicago-lakeshore-hospital-state-federal-investigation">ProPublica Illinois first published an investigation in late 2018</a> revealing allegations of sexual assault and abuse of children there, as well federal and state inquiries into safety violations. The Chicago Tribune separately reported on troubling conditions at the hospital.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">Hundreds of children in state care used to pass through the hospital.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">For years, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services relied on Lakeshore to treat state wards with serious mental illnesses. But some of those children reported being abused. Children also <a href="https://features.propublica.org/stuck-kids/illinois-dcfs-children-psychiatric-hospitals-beyond-medical-necessity/">remained at the hospital after they had been medically cleared</a> for discharge because the state agency was unable to find them placements.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">DCFS stopped sending children to Lakeshore in 2018 following the news reports and after the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/aclu-demands-removal-of-children-dcfs-aurora-chicago-lakeshore-hospital">took the agency to federal court</a> over the issue.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">Perhaps the biggest blow to the hospital came after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/chicago-psychiatric-hospital-will-lose-federal-money-and-its-license-is-threatened-after-allegations-of-abuse">shut off federal funding to the hospital in December</a>. Lakeshore officials had previously said in court records that the hospital would be forced to close if it lost Medicare and Medicaid payments, which make up the bulk of its funding.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">Lakeshore can appeal the termination or reapply for its Medicare certification, provided it can show “reasonable assurance” that the reason it was terminated no longer exists and will not recur. A spokeswoman for CMS said Friday that the federal agency has not received an application from the hospital and has not been made aware of any appeals.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">“In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the trajectory to recertification has understandably been delayed while officials focus on the crisis at hand,” Chipparoni said. “When Illinois has turned the corner on COVID-19, we will revisit when and how quickly we can again meet that need.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">Hospital officials have previously said their top priority was “the health and safety of the children we treat.” Chipparoni said Lakeshore has been a “safety net in its community and Illinois for almost 60 years. Our mission to provide quality access to underprivileged and often forgotten populations remains resolute, but on hold.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">Chipparoni declined to say when the hospital planned to reopen or what steps would need to occur before that could happen, but he said hospital officials were evaluating their options.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.4">Charles Golbert, the Cook County public guardian, was surprised by the news of the temporary closure. Golbert filed a federal lawsuit in December calling Lakeshore a “hospital of horrors” where children were sexually abused, attacked and sedated.</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">The hospital’s CEO at the time said she would “vigorously defend Chicago Lakeshore Hospital using facts rather than the egregious distortion that has been portrayed before the press” and said a lack of state funding prevented children from “getting appropriate care at the right time and in the right place.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">“It’s unfortunate in that I feel the situation might have been salvageable if strong and decisive action had been taken two years ago when all of the problems first came to light,” Golbert said in an email, adding: “Chicago Lakeshore was also resistant to meaningful review and change. And all the while children continued to be harmed there.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">In January, the Illinois Department of Public Health moved to revoke Lakeshore’s license, citing its “substantial and continued failure” to comply with licensing requirements. Multiple inspections dating to 2018 found repeated deficiencies that put patients’ health and safety at risk, according to federal records. Lakeshore responded to the state by requesting a hearing to appeal. A prehearing call is scheduled for next month, though it’s not clear what bearing the decision to temporarily close the hospital will have on the revocation process.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3">An IDPH spokeswoman said Friday the department had not received word from the hospital that it planned to close.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.4">State Rep. Greg Harris, a Chicago Democrat whose district includes the hospital, was among the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/aurora-chicago-lakeshore-hospital-state-legislators-response-dcfs">lawmakers who demanded an independent review</a> of the hospital following ProPublica Illinois’ investigation in 2018. On Friday, Harris said he would be interested in maintaining the hospital as a resource for the community, patients and employees if there was a way to ensure quality care.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.5">“It had served the community well, but in the last couple of years, as you guys have reported, it just had so many problems and so much mismanagement and so much harm was done there,” he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">As news emerged that the novel coronavirus was infecting hundreds of workers in meatpacking plants, Gregoria Rivas began worrying that her chicken processing facility in North Carolina wasn’t doing enough to protect workers like her from the virus.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">There was no social distancing, she said. Everywhere she went at the Case Farms plant, there were dozens of workers crowded into a small space. In the locker room, where everyone put on their uniforms. On the cutting line, where she spent eight hours slicing chicken breasts. In the cafeteria during lunch. Even at break time, when workers lined up to use the bathroom.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">“I tried to bring my own face mask that I had bought at the pharmacy, but they wouldn’t let me wear it,” said Rivas, 31. “When they wouldn’t let me wear my own mask, I went to the nurse’s station at the plant, and they said there were no masks available.” (Mike Popowycz, vice chairman of Case Farms, said it’s taking the pandemic “very seriously” and has taken several measures to protect workers.)</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">So Rivas said she called the state’s Department of Labor with the help of a local worker’s center.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">Rivas is far from alone. Nearly 4,000 workers from across the country have gone to the federal agency that polices worker health and safety with concerns that their employers haven’t done enough to protect them from the coronavirus as of April 3, according to records obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">Some 27% of the complaints to OSHA came from the health care industry, from workers on the front lines of providing COVID-19 care. Another 72% came from other types of employees, with large quantities from manufacturing and retail workers, with the remainder listed as unknown.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">Even as OSHA has been inundated with COVID-19-related complaints, the agency has issued a series of guidelines that roll back safety standards and virtually eliminate non-health care workers from government protection.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">That poses a serious risk to millions of essential workers, many of whom live paycheck-to-paycheck, safety advocates say. Dozens of workers, including meat cutters, supermarket greeters, airport screeners and bus drivers have died as the disease has spread.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.4">And it raises significant questions as President Donald Trump and several governors lay out plans to reopen the economy.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">“Workers are getting sick and dying, and the government agency that they have turned to for 40 years to protect them from everything from chemicals in the workplace to unguarded machines to the H1N1 pandemic has said, ‘Sorry, you’re on your own,’” said Debbie Berkowitz, a former top OSHA policy adviser now at the worker-oriented National Employment Law Project.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">A spokesperson for the Department of Labor, OSHA’s parent agency, said in a statement: “Since the emergence of COVID-19, OSHA is taking swift and decisive action to protect workers in high-risk industries.” The statement continued: “OSHA has a number of tools it can use to protect workers from workplace hazards caused by COVID-19. … However, OSHA is providing enforcement discretion to help employers comply with OSHA requirements during the challenging times the pandemic has created and to help ensure that PPE [personal protective equipment] is available in workplaces — including healthcare facilities — where it is needed most.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">The government has received a raft of complaints from non-medical workers in an array of non-medical industries.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">More than a dozen employees at an Intel computer chip fabrication plant in Oregon filed reports with the state worker protection agency saying they weren’t able to maintain a 6-foot distance from their co-workers. “You have to be literally 2 inches from someone’s face or body,” said Brent Macias, one of the employees who filed a complaint and developed coronavirus symptoms. A spokesperson for Intel said the company is taking steps to implement social distancing at its manufacturing sites, such as staggering shift changes and limiting activities that require close proximity.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.4">In Florida, 35 fast food workers at the Orlando airport filed a complaint with the federal OSHA claiming that their employer, HMSHost, sometimes failed to offer hot water to wash their hands and provided them with little protective gear. “They were not helping us,” said Maria Gonzalez, a cashier who made $11.21 an hour before being furloughed in late March. “They were not doing anything — no training, no gloves, no masks, no hand sanitizer — pretty much nothing to protect us.” At least one HMSHost employee at the airport has tested positive for COVID-19, according to a union organizer who spoke with the ill worker. (Spokeswoman Sheila Bliss said HMSHost has implemented protective and safety measures that go beyond recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Our associates and travelers remain our greatest concern and we will take all recommended measures to protect them,” she said.)</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.5">Over the past two weeks, OSHA and the CDC have issued a series of guidelines and directives that have weakened protections for front-line workers outside the medical field. For example, the CDC released <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/critical-workers/implementing-safety-practices.html">guidance</a> on April 8 that critical workers who’d been exposed to the coronavirus could return to work as long as they don’t have any symptoms and wear a mask. The guidance came despite comments just three days earlier from the government’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-20/">25% to 50%</a> of the people with the virus may be asymptomatic. (Everyone else who has been exposed is advised to self-quarantine for 14 days.)</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">This was followed by directives from OSHA. Last Friday, the agency announced that it <a href="https://www.osha.gov/memos/2020-04-10/enforcement-guidance-recording-cases-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19">would not require</a> employers outside health care, emergency response or corrections to investigate whether COVID-19 cases among employees are work-related unless multiple people in the same vicinity get sick.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">Then on Monday, OSHA issued an <a href="https://www.osha.gov/memos/2020-04-13/interim-enforcement-response-plan-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19">enforcement directive</a> detailing its approach to handling COVID-19 complaints. Medical workers, who have been heavily affected by the virus, have been prioritized. At least 88 U.S. health care workers have died from COVID-19, according to an unofficial list kept by the website Medscape.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">But OSHA said it would not formally handle any complaints about the coronavirus from other essential workers. Instead, the agency will send a letter to the employer, which then has five business days to notify the agency about how it has addressed the complaint. The memo notes that these complaints “will not normally result in an on-site inspection.” The agency said it would “consider” an inspection if it believes the response is inadequate.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3">“It totally excludes everybody but health care,” said David Michaels, former OSHA director in the Obama administration. “Everyone else is told that there is nothing that OSHA could do.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.4">But Ed Foulke, who oversaw OSHA from 2006 to 2008, said the agency is correct to establish priorities when there are limited resources and inspectors are working from home. “This is an unprecedented event and the reasonable approach is to say, ‘Where is the greatest need?’” he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.5">“OSHA clearly cares” about non-medical workers, Foulke said. “An inspector can’t be sent out for every complaint. You can’t do it. You have to be realistic.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.6">Still, the Trump administration’s approach differs from how other infectious diseases have been handled in the past, from the hepatitis B outbreak in hospitals and the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s to H1N1 and the Ebola virus in more recent years, according to longtime industry professionals. In each of those cases, OSHA issued more forceful <a href="https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/Directive_pdf/CPL_02_02-075.pdf">enforcement guidance</a> and carried a stronger public presence. Now, the agency isn’t even on the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-presidents-coronavirus-task-force/">White House Coronavirus Task Force</a>.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.7">For example, during the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, OSHA took additional steps to safeguard worker health, including issuing a directive that required employers to abide by CDC guidance. By contrast, OSHA’s COVID-19 memo states that inspectors should consult CDC guidance and grants them latitude to use discretion even when an employer’s measures are not as protective as what the CDC recommends.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">In addition, during H1N1, OSHA laid out specific scenarios that could result in violations under the general duty standard, detailing the nitty-gritty of sneeze guards and the setup of “airborne infection isolation rooms.” Today, the Trump administration provides no such guidance for inspectors; in fact, it emphasizes the high legal bar for inspectors to cite employers under the standard.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.1">“It’s written to make it much more difficult to issue citations,” Michaels said. “It gives the employers certain outs as to why they’re not following CDC guidelines.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.2">There have been no inspections resulting from COVID-19 complaints, said one OSHA employee — at least not in the OSHA region the employee works in. The OSHA staffer added that the agency could be more proactive in its response to these complaints. “It seems a lot of it is providing workers with information but not trying to address the particular issues people are raising,” the employee said. “We should be more forceful and direct in our interactions with the employer.” The OSHA employee asked to remain anonymous because the worker is not authorized to speak with reporters.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.3">OSHA is limited in how it can respond because it doesn’t have a regulation it can enforce that’s directly related to airborne infectious diseases. (OSHA notes that there are eight regulations that may apply to coronavirus, including provisions related to hand-washing, personal protective equipment and an employer’s general duty to provide a safe workplace.)</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.4">But there are ways OSHA could have been more active, former agency officials and worker advocates say.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.5">For example, an infectious disease standard was being drafted, but was never completed, during the Obama administration. It was shelved when Trump took office, according to <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?RIN=1218-AC46">federal rule-making documents</a>.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.6">In late January, as the coronavirus was spreading in China and beginning to arrive in the United States, Democratic congressional aides met with Department of Labor staff to urge them to issue a compliance directive and temporary emergency standard to protect health care workers.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.7">Such a standard could easily be adapted to confront COVID-19, but Labor Department leaders questioned the need, a congressional aide who was at the meeting said. “There wasn’t a whole lot of consciousness about what was going to be coming down the line,” the aide said. “I think they weren’t taking the disease seriously and they certainly weren’t interested in enforcing.”</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">As COVID-19 cases began to multiply in early March, unions petitioned Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, requesting an emergency standard for health workers. And House Democrats began drafting language to insert into a coronavirus response bill that was rapidly working its way through Congress. The legislation would have required health care employers to implement an infectious disease exposure control plan. But the American Hospital Association said the provision would be “impossible to implement” because of the shortage of N95 respirator masks and would dramatically reduce the number of patients hospitals could treat. Congress stripped it from the bill.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.1">Meanwhile, as America’s health care system began raising red flags about the shortage of safety gear, OSHA started issuing the first of several directives, rolling back standards intended to protect doctors and nurses. In mid-March, the agency suspended annual fit testing for N95 masks in an effort to conserve equipment.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.2">As recorded cases reached the thousands, it issued a <a href="https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3990.pdf">packet of tips</a> for employers but emphasized that its recommendations were not enforceable.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.3">In early April, as the supply shortage became ever more critical, OSHA relaxed other rules, allowing for the extended use and reuse of N95s and for respirators certified in other countries.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.4">“Some of these, you are dealing with a crisis situation, they are moving to address the lack of equipment,” said Peg Seminario, former health and safety director of the AFL-CIO. “But every one of these is rolling back existing protections and requirements. It’s not putting out something new or more.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.5">The agency has been diminished in resources and leadership under the Trump administration, and former OSHA officials say that has dulled the agency’s response to COVID-19. “Their ability to deal with this virus is made even weaker by a lack of resources because the Trump administration has shrunk the agency to the point that they have no ability to respond,” said Berkowitz.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.6">At the start of the year, OSHA had 862 federal inspectors, the lowest number in the agency’s history, according to data NELP obtained from the agency.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.7">With OSHA playing a passive role, some governors have issued their own worker-safety mandates. On Sunday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20216-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency">executive order</a> requiring employers to provide essential workers with masks to wear when they interact with the public. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy went further, <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/20200408e.shtml">ordering</a> retail businesses to cut their maximum occupancy in half and install barriers between workers and customers.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.8">Twenty-two states run their own occupational health and safety agencies for public and private workers, with federal approval, which are required to match or exceed federal regulations and directives. Some of them appear to be taking a more aggressive approach. In Oregon, where there have been nearly 2,800 COVID-19-related complaints to date, about a dozen inspections have been conducted across a variety of industries. The state agency is also conducting “spot checks” to ensure that employers who received and sent letters in response to a complaint are following through.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.9">But a patchwork approach to keeping workers safe might not bode well for the plans to reopen businesses. In recent days, many of the largest outbreaks have been at work, highlighted by the spread of the disease to more than <a href="https://www.jamestownsun.com/newsmd/coronavirus/5058771-Over-600-COVID-19-cases-linked-to-Smithfield-meatpacking-plant-in-Sioux-Falls-as-CDC-arrives-to-assess-outbreak">600 workers</a> at Smithfield Foods’ pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">That could raise the prospect of the disease reigniting if more precautions aren’t taken, according to public health experts. “Until there’s a real discussion about how workers beyond hospitals are going to be protected,” Michaels said, “I don’t see how we can be talking about bringing workers back.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.1">And that discussion could mean a lot for workers like Gregoria Rivas.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.2">In North Carolina, Rivas said she received little help from the state’s OSHA when she called to voice her concerns around the possible spread of COVID-19 at Case Farms. On the other end of the phone line, Rivas said, an inspector took down her complaint but told her there wasn’t much the agency could do because it doesn’t have specific regulations for infectious diseases. The agency had made recommendations to businesses, but it had no power to enforce them, the inspector said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.3">(Natalie Bouchard of North Carolina’s Department of Labor said the agency investigates every complaint. In a statement, she confirmed the state has no occupational safety standard concerning COVID-19 but added that “it is the employer’s duty to provide each employee with a ‘place of employment free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious injury or serious physical harm to his employees.’”)</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.4">Discouraged by the response, Rivas, who has a 2-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter, decided to quit rather than risk infection. “I thought I was going to receive some answers that would reassure me,” she said. “But from what I understood, it didn’t matter what was happening, whether it’s a pandemic or not, the plant was going to continue working as normal.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">A congressional subcommittee is investigating whether the U.S. government is paying too much for ventilators made by a Dutch company that received millions in tax dollars to develop an affordable one for pandemics, but is now charging quadruple the price under a new deal.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">“This all seems very fishy to me,” said <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/K000391-raja-krishnamoorthi">Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi</a>, who chairs the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. The subcommittee falls under the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">The deals between the Department of Health and Human Services and a U.S. division of Royal Philips N.V. were the subject of two ProPublica stories in recent weeks, and a <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2020-04-15.RK%20to%20Rocha%20Philips%20re%20Triology%20Evo.pdf">letter</a> from Krishnamoorthi to the head of Philips’ North American operations on behalf of the subcommittee cites those reports. His subcommittee demanded records and information from Philips dating to 2014, when the agency’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA, struck a $13.8 million deal with the company to develop ventilators for the Strategic National Stockpile. Based on the advice of experts, the agreement called for the devices to be low cost, portable, durable and easy to use by personnel with limited medical training.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">Once Philips’ Respironics division received clearance for that ventilator from the Food and Drug Administration last year, BARDA ordered 10,000 of them for $3,280 each — a price agreed upon when Philips entered into the original deal in 2014.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">As ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/taxpayers-paid-millions-to-design-a-low-cost-ventilator-for-a-pandemic-instead-the-company-is-selling-versions-of-it-overseas-">previously reported</a>, Philips never produced any of those devices for the stockpile. Instead, as the coronavirus spread, the company manufactured commercial versions of the ventilator at its factory outside Pittsburgh and sold them for far higher prices overseas. Then, rather than pushing the company to accelerate the delivery of the ventilators developed for the stockpile, HHS this month <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-company-promised-cheap-ventilators-to-the-government-never-delivered-and-is-now-charging-quadruple-the-price-for-the-new-ones">agreed to buy</a> 43,000 of the commercial version at a price of $15,000 per ventilator.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">Kristhnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois, said he found Philips’ actions “very troubling.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">BARDA, he said, rightly recognized that the U.S. needed low-cost ventilators to “preserve people’s lives” in a pandemic and was able to get the private sector to “develop exactly such a ventilator.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">But once Philips got the crucial FDA clearance for the new design, Krishnamoorthi said, “they turn around — at the very time we most need these ventilators — and use the fruits of taxpayers’ dollars to essentially sell a high-margin version of what taxpayers wanted to foreign consumers and deprioritized the sales of what taxpayers wanted.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">In its letter to Philips, the House subcommittee is asking questions that Philips has declined to answer so far and that may reveal whether the commercial version, known as the EV300, is virtually the same as the one developed with taxpayer funds. The subcommittee has asked the firm to detail the differences between the stockpile ventilator and the commercial version.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">The subcommittee is also trying to find out what Philips was charging others for the commercial version before the pandemic and whether it is now charging the federal government more. It has asked how many ventilators Philips has sold, at what prices and to whom since September 2019, the month that HHS placed its order for stockpile ventilators.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">Steve Klink, a Philips spokesman, said his company was reviewing the letter and looks forward to assisting the subcommittee.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.4">“We take this matter very seriously,” Klink said in an email to ProPublica. “Philips is working very closely with the U.S. government to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will continue those efforts.”</p>

</p>
                        
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">HHS originally gave Philips three years to deliver the stockpile ventilators. Klink told ProPublica last month that Philips planned to stick to that timeline. He said that the company had only made the stockpile ventilator in small batches and did not want to ramp up production on a product that had not been mass produced. Instead, it is increasing production of the more expensive commercial version. Though based in Amsterdam, the company only makes ventilators in the U.S.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">The House subcommittee has asked Philips for the fine print of the contracts, which neither Philips nor HHS would turn over to ProPublica. It also requested all records of communications between Philips and the government team that struck the recent deal.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">Kristhnamoorthi questioned why President Donald Trump didn’t use the Defense Production Act to order Philips to produce the ventilators designed for this very situation and at the price BARDA originally agreed to pay.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3">“This seems like such a clear cut example of why the Defense Production Act was created, and this is a situation that’s quite frankly life and death in a lot of cities and hospitals,” he said. “Why would you ever not invoke the full authority under the law to make sure that we preserve the lives of the taxpayers, the investors into this technology?”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">Landlords in at least four states have violated the eviction ban passed by Congress last month, a review of records shows, moving to throw more than a hundred people out of their homes.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">In an effort to help renters amid the coronavirus pandemic and skyrocketing unemployment, the March 27 CARES Act banned eviction filings for all federally backed rental units nationwide, more than a quarter of the total.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">But ProPublica found building owners who are simply not following the law, with no apparent consequence, filing to evict tenants from properties in Georgia, Oklahoma, Texas and Florida. The scores of cases ProPublica found represent only a small slice of the true total because there’s no nationwide — or, in many cases, even statewide — database of eviction filings.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">Four landlords said they were reversing eviction filings after being contacted by ProPublica and informed the filings were illegal. National real estate trade groups, however, are already lobbying to limit the scope of the ban.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">“Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The evictions at The Life at Pine Village were done in error and have been halted.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">Olive Tree has a portfolio of buildings in Texas and Georgia worth more than $500 million. Braykovich said staff had been confused about what is covered by the eviction ban, noting the “unusual and quick implementation of changes in the law.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">At the Laurel Pointe Apartments in Forest Park, Georgia, the landlord filed for eviction against 25 households several days after the federal ban passed.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">A Laurel Pointe spokesperson said that after receiving ProPublica’s request for comment: “We began a thorough investigation and determined we did unknowingly and wrongfully begin the eviction process for several residents. No residents were served or removed from their homes and first thing this morning we filed for dismissal of all evictions.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">The recent eviction filings underscore Congress’ failure to include an enforcement mechanism in the law, as well as <a href="https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2020/04/amid-pandemic-congress-suspends-evictions-but-not-for-all/">the complexity</a> of the ban, which only applies to certain categories of properties.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">“There’s nothing in the bill that seems to create a clear penalty for violating the new law,” said Dan Immergluck, an urban studies professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta. He added it’s not clear that landlords even know about the ban.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">It’s impossible to know how widespread the violations are. Eviction filings are notoriously difficult to track around the country because they are typically handled in city or county courts, only some of which post cases online, even during normal times. The roughly 120 eviction filings ProPublica found represents a review of records in just seven counties in three states, along with the entire state of Oklahoma. These places were chosen based on their population, ease of access to online records and because they had a substantial number of new cases in the past month. Several other county courts where ProPublica tried to review records have stopped posting case information altogether because of the pandemic.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.4">Landlords are still allowed to file some kinds of evictions at covered properties, including when a tenant is a threat to others. They are prohibited from evicting tenants for failing to pay rent. But documents for the roughly 70 cases that ProPublica was able to obtain showed landlords filed specifically for nonpayment of rent, in violation of the law.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.5">Landlords are already lobbying to roll back the more than two-week old federal ban. In a letter to the White House and Congress this month, several national trade groups pressed for the eviction ban <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2020/04/10/money-forbearance-and-evictions-landlords-want-it-all-from-washington/">to be narrowed</a> to cover only tenants “adversely affected by the outbreak, but also require residents to officially notify the property owner,” The Real Deal reported.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">An eviction filing does not mean a tenant is immediately kicked to the curb. Tenants are sometimes protected by state and local laws as well. The procedure is different in every state, but under normal circumstances, it could be several weeks from the time a tenant misses the rent before a sheriff makes it to their door. Tenants facing eviction often don’t know their legal rights, advocates say, and the notice alone could cause them to leave their homes, posing public health risks in the face of an ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">Even if tenants see the eviction process through, the filings can have other serious consequences. It often carries significant fees for tenants and can get them added to blacklists used by many landlords to screen potential renters. “It immediately impairs your ability to get out of the situation that you’re in, and it’s that much harder to find a landlord that will rent to you,” said Erin Willoughby, a lawyer with the Atlanta Legal Aid Society.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">The CARES act prohibits landlords from charging tenants fees as well, but most of the eviction filings ProPublica reviewed show that landlords sought late fees and legal costs from their tenants. The fees vary, but typically amount to 20% to 30% of the tenant’s monthly rent. In some cases reviewed by ProPublica, attorneys’ fees alone were as high as $300.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3">Housing advocates around the country are struggling even to identify which buildings fall under the eviction ban, which lasts until July 25. The CARES Act lays out several categories, including buildings with federally backed mortgages and others that receive certain tax credits or participate in voucher programs. That covers more than 25% of all rentals in the country, according to <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/cares-act-eviction-moratorium-covers-all-federally-financed-rentals-thats-one-four-us-rental-units">estimates</a> by the Urban Institute, or at least 12.3 million units. There is no single tool or data source that tells renters, advocates or landlords if their building is covered by the ban. That makes it difficult for tenants to know if their eviction case was filed illegally or not.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.4">Even as some landlords are violating the ban, overall evictions have dropped substantially in the regions ProPublica reviewed. In addition to the CARES Act moratorium, some states have issued their own eviction bans, and many physical court locations are currently closed to nonessential business, making it difficult to file in places where there is no online portal. While many of the illegal filings ProPublica found came days after the ban was passed March 27, records show landlords have continued to file for evictions in the past two weeks.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.5">Most of the landlords filing evictions since the ban went into effect did not respond to requests for comment. They include <a href="http://www.emeraldequitygrp.com/">Emerald Equity Group</a>, a New York City-based firm that is best known in the industry for purchasing a <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2020/01/16/emerald-equity-weighing-all-options-to-save-massive-multifamily-portfolio/">portfolio of East Harlem</a> rental buildings for more than $350 million in 2016.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.6">Emerald’s CEO, Isaac Kassirer, is the subject of frequent <a href="https://therealdeal.com/tag/isaac-kassirer/">stories</a> in the business press, including for investing in rent-regulated buildings with an eye to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-landlords-in-a-financial-bind-from-new-rent-law-11561201200">increasing rents</a>, tenant <a href="https://www.amny.com/real-estate/east-harlem-rent-stabilization-lawsuit-1-17198748/">lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://indypendent.org/2018/07/vulture-equity-circles-east-harlem/">allegations</a> of poor building upkeep. Kassirer has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-landlords-in-a-financial-bind-from-new-rent-law-11561201200">said</a> that Emerald’s apartments are affordable and that he never harasses tenants.</p>

                    <p class="dek">When Laura Whalen went to a hospital with COVID-19, she brought her kids. Her husband was already in an ICU, and she couldn’t risk them exposing their grandma. But the state told her to find someone to take them or it would.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">Between March 30 and April 1, Emerald filed eviction papers on nine tenants at 13Ten Apartments, a complex in a low-income, largely black part of DeKalb County outside of Atlanta. But Kassirer’s firm took out a $47 million government-backed <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6838915-13ten-Mortgage-Documents.html#document/p20">loan</a> on the property in 2019, which puts it under the eviction ban in the CARES act.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.1">ProPublica was able to identify illegal eviction filings by cross-referencing the court filings in Houston, Tampa, metro Atlanta and Oklahoma against mortgage documents and databases from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The two government-sponsored agencies support the housing market by buying loans from lenders and reselling them to investors.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.2">Legal experts say that, in the absence of federal penalties, landlords are unlikely to face any consequences for bringing the illegal cases in local courts.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.3">“There’s not a lot at stake if the landlord loses the case, or if it gets dismissed,” said Eric Dunn, director of litigation at the National Housing Law Project. Many tenants don’t have the resources to challenge their cases, and the bar is high for establishing a pattern of frivolous lawsuits before a judge.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.4">“It’s very uncommon that courts levy sanctions against landlords,” Dunn said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.5">Because there is no legislation relieving tenants from rent payments during the pandemic, renters who are currently protected from eviction will still be responsible for paying any back-rent when the federal and local bans are lifted.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.6">In the absence of rental assistance, housing advocates are bracing for the worst when the eviction process returns. “We don’t want there to be a cliff that low-income renters fall off of once the moratoria are lifted,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.7">Yentel’s group is advocating for additional legislation to provide funding for short-term rental assistance to ensure that tenants and landlords can continue to pay their bills.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">The U.S. Department of Agriculture is studying whether the novel coronavirus can be spread by mosquitoes, although the theory was ruled out last month by the World Health Organization and independent experts say such transmission is virtually impossible.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">The research effort is cited in an internal briefing memo on the coronavirus response dated last week and reviewed by ProPublica. The memo does not say how much money the study will cost, and the USDA did not respond to questions.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">Joseph Conlon, a former U.S. Navy entomologist and technical adviser for the American Mosquito Control Association, said the possibility of mosquito transmission of the coronavirus is “nil.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">Conlon has encountered claims online and in his email inbox that the government is covering up mosquito transmission of the coronavirus. He called that idea a “conspiracy theory.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">Conlon said the USDA research could help stop speculation about mosquito transmission, a notion that has gained some traction as the global death toll rises.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">The <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters">WHO</a> has definitively stated that the coronavirus cannot be transmitted via mosquitoes, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html">said</a> it “has no data to suggest” that the coronavirus is spread by mosquitoes or ticks. Independent experts said there has been no demonstrated case of any of the family of viruses to which the novel coronavirus belongs being transmitted by a mosquito.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">“Mosquitoes cannot transmit the disease,” said Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman, because the virus does not widely circulate in blood and is more prevalent in lungs and the respiratory tract.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">Even if the mosquito did digest the virus, it would have to survive the digestive process and transfer to the insect’s salivary glands to then infect a human, experts said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.4">“It’s an extremely complicated process, and there are a number of different barriers there,” Conlon said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">In a <a href="https://twitter.com/UNGeneva/status/1247865039152914434">tweet</a> last week, the United Nations office in Geneva said there is “NO evidence to date” that mosquitoes carry the coronavirus, and it urged people not to spread rumors and to be vigilant against “disinformation.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">Jacquelyn Mason, a researcher at <a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/">First Draft News</a>, which tracks disinformation on the internet, said Tuesday that she had found relatively few social media posts claiming that mosquitoes can transmit the coronavirus, and the theory does not appear to be pushed intentionally by any particular group.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">Fox News published a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/can-mosquitoes-spread-coronavirus">story</a> last week addressing the question of mosquito transmission, and it quoted a health expert dismissing the possibility.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">The CDC did not respond to questions. Its assessment about mosquito transmission first appeared in an FAQ section of its website in late March, according to versions of the page captured by the Internet Archive.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.4">The U.S. government document seen by ProPublica said the USDA is identifying animals susceptible to coronavirus infection to determine if mosquitoes and midges, a type of small fly, could be vectors.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.5">Analysis of the coronavirus genome suggests that it originated in bats before eventually spreading to humans, and research into how animals react to the coronavirus is seen as crucial to understanding it.</p>

                    <p class="dek">Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, ventilators have been a key focus of the media, politicians and the president. But most of these references miss some key points. This is what ProPublica’s Caroline Chen has learned in her reporting.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">In addition to the USDA effort, scientists in Germany, the Netherlands, China, Canada and elsewhere are also studying animal susceptibility to the coronavirus, and they have thus far determined that ferrets, cats and dogs can be infected, Jasarevic said. Other animals being investigated include pigs, chickens and turkeys.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">The USDA has a well-established role in figuring out animal susceptibility to viruses. After the SARS outbreak, researchers within the agency’s Agricultural Research Service published <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=154810">experiment results</a> showing that domestic poultry were not infected with the virus and did not spread it to humans.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">Leyi Wang, a veterinary virologist at the University of Illinois, helped to confirm recently that a tiger at the Bronx Zoo had contracted the coronavirus. In that case, it’s more likely the virus was transmitted by a zookeeper than a mosquito, Wang said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3">“People still need to avoid mosquito bites,” Conlon said. “Mosquitoes transmit several other diseases and have their own immune issues that would make people particularly susceptible to a coronavirus infection.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">An internal memorandum written by U.S. officials and addressed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warns that cutting funding to the World Health Organization, as President Donald Trump said he would do Tuesday, would erode America’s global standing, threaten U.S. lives and hobble global efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">The memo, which was prepared before Trump’s Rose Garden announcement, was written by officials within the State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs and includes a detailed list of how U.S. funding to the WHO helps countries in the Middle East control the pandemic.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">A draft version of the memo, which was labeled “Sensitive But Unclassified” and was titled “Information Memo for the Secretary,” was seen by ProPublica.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">It’s unclear if the memo has been sent to Pompeo, and the draft version reviewed by ProPublica was still unfinished. The State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">The Trump administration has worked closely with the WHO on pandemic response, especially in places where the United States has a limited presence. One U.S. official with knowledge of the State Department memo said it was likely written so that Pompeo could justify waiving parts of Trump’s order, allowing U.S. funding to the WHO to continue. The emphasis on how the halt in funding could bolster China was likely meant to appeal to anti-China hawks in the administration, this person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">Trump announced on Tuesday that he would halt WHO funding while his administration reviews what he described as mismanaging and “covering up” the coronavirus spread. He said the WHO had not done enough to call out China’s lack of transparency. The virus originated in China before spreading worldwide.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">But Trump himself has praised China for its coronavirus response. On Jan. 24, he <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1220818115354923009">tweeted</a> that China “has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,” and that the U.S. appreciates the country’s “transparency.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">A White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-demanding-accountability-world-health-organization/">fact sheet</a> issued on Wednesday said the administration will “redirect global health aid to others directly engaged in the fight.” But in some countries with weak health sectors, the WHO is by far the strongest conduit for U.S. and other international funds meant to protect public health, a U.S. official with knowledge of the situation said. That could mean the administration will find it difficult to reprogram funding originally meant for the agency.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">The U.S. is the largest donor to the WHO, contributing more than $400 million per year. And the administration had chosen to funnel extra funds provided by Congress through the WHO as well, a tacit endorsement of its capabilities.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">“Current discussions regarding pausing U.S. assistance to the WHO to combat the pandemic risks not only further undermining our ability to help host governments address urgent needs, but also undermines the U.S. narrative of a long-standing partner at precisely the time posts are most reliant on that narrative,” the memo said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">Pausing funding to the organization, the memo said, “will impact over $50 million in U.S. assistance planned to help host governments address urgent needs and risks undermining the U.S. narrative of a long-standing health leader, ceding ground to the (People’s Republic of China).”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">Congress provided that funding in supplemental packages in March, the memo said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.4">Congressional Democrats quickly denounced Trump’s decision to halt funding to the WHO, and they argue that at least some of the U.S. funding to the organization is beyond his power to stop.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.5">“President Trump does not have the authority to withhold funds that Congress has appropriated for the United States’ assessed contribution to the World Health Organization,” said Evan Hollander, a spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">But the emergency funds given to the State Department and USAID and referenced in the memo are separate from the “assessed contributions.” The additional funding that Congress provided for the coronavirus response gave the administration much more flexibility to determine recipients, meaning that Trump is legally able to halt those funds.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">The memo detailed a number of key WHO activities related to the pandemic fight. In Lebanon, the WHO sent test kits in February and planned to send masks, gloves and other supplies afterward, the memo said. In Yemen, which is already experiencing a humanitarian crisis because of years of war, the WHO was working to open ports for humanitarian supplies and providing American and Chinese tests.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">In Libya, which is also in ongoing conflict, the memo said the WHO is “the most technically viable implementing partner on public health issues; very limited alternatives exist.” Around two dozen Americans in Libya have said they want to return to the U.S., but the State Department cannot help them do this for now, the memo said, and the agency has urged them to shelter in place. “Any one of them who encounters a health crisis will likely depend on WHO-provided assistance to make it through,” the memo said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3">In Algeria, where the coronavirus pandemic has proven especially deadly, USAID had approved half a million dollars in funding for the WHO’s response in the country and was considering sending a further $1.5 million, the memo said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.4">“The PRC, meanwhile, has sent a medical team of 13 doctors and eight medical assistants, while private organizations have donated over $450,000 worth of medical equipment,” the memo said, referring to China.</p>
