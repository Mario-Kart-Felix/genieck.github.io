<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, we are now publishing from our homes—in March we even moved our office into storage. The near-collapse of advertising on Colossal means drastic cuts, and we’re doing everything we can to keep the lights on (in our apartments) and the art and culture flowing to your inbox, our website, and social media channels. <strong>Membership is now our main source of revenue</strong>.</p>
<p>Without you, there is no us. Even if you can’t support us directly during this extraordinary time, it means the world to us to know you’re out there. If membership isn&#8217;t for you, consider a one-time donation via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme2/thisiscolossal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayPal</a> or by credit card through <a href="https://donorbox.org/colossal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donorbox</a>. </p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Why does Colossal have a Membership program?</dt>
<dd>In order to establish and nurture a sustainable business that would allow us to keep moving forward in our work uplifting artists around the world, we diversified Colossal on Day One with a range of revenue streams. Digital advertising, e-commerce, and curatorial commissions all help us meet our bottom line, pay our staff, and keep our twinkling string of cafe lights on. As we look toward our tenth year and approach our seven thousandth (!) article published, we are proud to offer a new way for readers to help support the publication you know and love.</dd>
<dt>What do Memberships go toward?</dt>
<dd>Membership fees will be specifically earmarked toward staff salaries, site upkeep and hosting costs, rent, and other expenses relating directly to our day-to-day publication. In the near future, a portion of collective membership fees may also be allocated toward the Membership Grant program.</dd>
<dt>What if I'm not interested in the membership benefits? Can I still support Colossal with a one-time donation?</dt>
<dd>Yes, of course. You can always donate via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme2/thisiscolossal" target="_blank">PayPal</a> or by credit card through <a href="https://donorbox.org/colossal" target="_blank">Donorbox</a>.
