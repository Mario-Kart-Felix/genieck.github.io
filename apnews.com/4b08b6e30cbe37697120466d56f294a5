(AP) — A team of retirees that scours the remote ravines and windswept plains of the Pacific Northwest for long-forgotten pioneer orchards has rediscovered 10 apple varieties that were believed to be extinct — the largest number ever unearthed in a single season by the nonprofit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lostappleproject/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Lost Apple Project</a><!-- -->.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The Vietnam veteran and former FBI agent who make up the nonprofit recently learned of their tally from last fall’s apple sleuthing from expert botanists at the <a href="http://www.temperateorchardconservancy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Temperate Orchard Conservancy</a><!-- --> in Oregon, where all the apples are sent for study and identification. The apples positively identified as previously “lost” were among hundreds of <a class="" href="/b62f47e1e3b74064b8e038ba9b9807de">fruits collected</a><!-- --> in October and November from 140-year-old orchards tucked into small canyons or hidden in forests that have since grown up around them in rural Idaho and Washington state.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-74"><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad-1470255291270-0" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“It was just one heck of a season. It was almost unbelievable. If we had found one apple or two apples a year in the past, we thought were were doing good. But we were getting one after another after another,” said EJ Brandt, who hunts for the apples along with fellow amateur botanist David Benscoter. “I don’t know how we’re going to keep up with that.”</p><div class="relatedStory-0-2-79 Component-block-0-2-75"><div class="intro-0-2-80">More Stories:</div><ul class="list-0-2-81"><li class="relatedStory-0-2-88"><a class="link-0-2-89" href="/b62f47e1e3b74064b8e038ba9b9807de">– <!-- -->Apple detectives comb US Northwest for ‘lost’ varieties</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-88"><a class="link-0-2-89" href="/32bb555a12fd6f98abe29e2f22e7324f">– <!-- -->Court throws out Trump rollback of school nutrition rules</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-88"><a class="link-0-2-89" href="/28a52737e04e11271b62982a462232b5">– <!-- -->Virus choking off supply of what Africa needs most: Food</a></li></ul></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Each fall, Brandt and Benscoter spend countless hours and log hundreds of miles searching for ancient — and often dying — apple trees across the Pacific Northwest by truck, all-terrain vehicle and on foot. They collect hundreds of apples from long-abandoned orchards that they find using old maps, county fair records, newspaper clippings and nursery sales ledgers that can tell them which homesteader bought what apple tree and when the purchase happened. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">By matching names from those records with property maps, they can pinpoint where an orchard might have been — and they often find a few specimens still growing there. The pair carefully note the location of each tree using GPS and tag the tree with a plastic band before bagging the apples in zip-close bags and shipping them to the Oregon experts for identification.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“When I find an apple that’s lost, I want to know who homesteaded it, when they were there, who their children were, when they took their last drink of water,” Brandt said. “We cannot afford to lose the name of even one of these landowners.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">In the winter, they return to the trees — often on foot or on snowshoes in freezing temperatures and blinding snow — to take wood cuttings that can be grafted onto root stock to propagate new trees of the varieties that come back as “lost” specimens.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-74"><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad-1470255291270-1" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The task is huge. North America once had 17,000 named varieties of domesticated apples, but only about 4,500 are known to exist today. The Lost Apple Project believes settlers planted a few hundred varieties in their corner of the Pacific Northwest alone as they moved across the U. S. West to try their hands at the pioneer life. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">These newcomers planted orchards with enough variety to get them through the long winter, with apples that ripened from early spring until the first frosts. Many were brought with the settlers in buckets from their homes on the East Coast and in the Midwest. Then, as now, trees planted for eating apples were not raised from seeds; cuttings taken from existing trees were grafted onto a generic root stock and raised to maturity. These cloned trees remove the genetic variation that often makes “wild” apples inedible.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">With the 10 latest varieties identified, Brandt and Benscoter have rediscovered a total of 23 varieties. The latest finds include the Sary Sinap, an ancient apple from Turkey; the Streaked Pippin, which may have originated as early as 1744 in New York; and the Butter Sweet of Pennsylvania, a variety that was first noted in a trial orchard in Illinois in 1901.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Botanists from the Temperate Orchard Society identified them by comparing the collected apples to watercolor illustrations created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the 1800s and early 1900s and by poring over written descriptions in old botany textbooks and reference guides, some of them more than 150 years old.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">One apple, the Gold Ridge, was particularly hard to identify because the experts couldn’t find any illustrations or descriptions of it anywhere. Finally, botanist Joanie Cooper went page by page through a reference book written by a botanist who died in 1912 until she found it.</p><div class="Component-image-0-2-72" data-key="media-placeholder"></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“It’s the luck of the draw,” said Shaun Shepherd, another Temperate Orchard Conservancy botanist. “And we learn more as we go along.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">With spring underway, the Lost Apple Project will soon enter its busy season as apple trees everywhere blossom and prepare to fruit. As they wait, Brandt and Benscoter are busy grafting wood cuttings from the newly discovered “lost” apple trees onto root stocks and updating their records from the last season. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Their nonprofit took a major hit when they had to cancel both an annual fair where they sell newly grafted “lost” apple trees and a class on how to graft wood to grow a new apple tree because of the new coronavirus. The two events fund much of their $10,000 annual budget that goes toward travel costs, apple shipping and apple identification.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“Two months ago, I was thinking: ‘This is going to be great. We’ve got 10 varieties that have been rediscovered,’ but .... right now, we couldn’t pay our bills,” Benscoter said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Still, the self-described apple detectives take comfort in their work as they navigate today’s unprecedented times and find inspiration in imagining the lives of the pioneers who planted these trees. About 25% of homesteads didn’t make it, Brandt said, and many settlers died or simply walked away to avoid starvation.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“It was a hard life. I can’t even imagine what they went through, but they survived and they went on with their lives,” he said. “It’s hard now, too, but it’s going to be OK. It’s all a part of life.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Find the Lost Apple Project on Facebook at <a

(AP) — A team of retirees that scours the remote ravines and windswept plains of the Pacific Northwest for long-forgotten pioneer orchards has rediscovered 10 apple varieties that were believed to be extinct — the largest number ever unearthed in a single season by the nonprofit \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lostappleproject/\">Lost Apple Project\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Vietnam veteran and former FBI agent who make up the nonprofit recently learned of their tally from last fall's apple sleuthing from expert botanists at the \u003ca href=\"http://www.temperateorchardconservancy.org/\">Temperate Orchard Conservancy\u003c/a> in Oregon, where all the apples are sent for study and identification. The apples positively identified as previously “lost” were among hundreds of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/b62f47e1e3b74064b8e038ba9b9807de\">fruits collected\u003c/a> in October and November from 140-year-old orchards tucked into small canyons or hidden in forests that have since grown up around them in rural Idaho and Washington state.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It was just one heck of a season. It was almost unbelievable. If we had found one apple or two apples a year in the past, we thought were were doing good. But we were getting one after another after another,” said EJ Brandt, who hunts for the apples along with fellow amateur botanist David Benscoter. “I don’t know how we’re going to keep up with that.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"0bcd5c20-6ae0-11ea-d7cf-19b1edbe1cfb\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Each fall, Brandt and Benscoter spend countless hours and log hundreds of miles searching for ancient — and often dying — apple trees across the Pacific Northwest by truck, all-terrain vehicle and on foot. They collect hundreds of apples from long-abandoned orchards that they find using old maps, county fair records, newspaper clippings and nursery sales ledgers that can tell them which homesteader bought what apple tree and when the purchase happened. \u003c/p>\u003cp>By matching names from those records with property maps, they can pinpoint where an orchard might have been — and they often find a few specimens still growing there. The pair carefully note the location of each tree using GPS and tag the tree with a plastic band before bagging the apples in zip-close bags and shipping them to the Oregon experts for identification.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When I find an apple that’s lost, I want to know who homesteaded it, when they were there, who their children were, when they took their last drink of water,” Brandt said. “We cannot afford to lose the name of even one of these landowners.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the winter, they return to the trees — often on foot or on snowshoes in freezing temperatures and blinding snow — to take wood cuttings that can be grafted onto root stock to propagate new trees of the varieties that come back as “lost” specimens.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The task is huge. North America once had 17,000 named varieties of domesticated apples, but only about 4,500 are known to exist today. The Lost Apple Project believes settlers planted a few hundred varieties in their corner of the Pacific Northwest alone as they moved across the U. S. West to try their hands at the pioneer life. \u003c/p>\u003cp>These newcomers planted orchards with enough variety to get them through the long winter, with apples that ripened from early spring until the first frosts. Many were brought with the settlers in buckets from their homes on the East Coast and in the Midwest. Then, as now, trees planted for eating apples were not raised from seeds; cuttings taken from existing trees were grafted onto a generic root stock and raised to maturity. These cloned trees remove the genetic variation that often makes “wild” apples inedible.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With the 10 latest varieties identified, Brandt and Benscoter have rediscovered a total of 23 varieties. The latest finds include the Sary Sinap, an ancient apple from Turkey; the Streaked Pippin, which may have originated as early as 1744 in New York; and the Butter Sweet of Pennsylvania, a variety that was first noted in a trial orchard in Illinois in 1901.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Botanists from the Temperate Orchard Society identified them by comparing the collected apples to watercolor illustrations created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the 1800s and early 1900s and by poring over written descriptions in old botany textbooks and reference guides, some of them more than 150 years old.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One apple, the Gold Ridge, was particularly hard to identify because the experts couldn't find any illustrations or descriptions of it anywhere. Finally, botanist Joanie Cooper went page by page through a reference book written by a botanist who died in 1912 until she found it.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"b977e05080f94885b09185d1f323a8be\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It’s the luck of the draw,” said Shaun Shepherd, another Temperate Orchard Conservancy botanist. “And we learn more as we go along.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>With spring underway, the Lost Apple Project will soon enter its busy season as apple trees everywhere blossom and prepare to fruit. As they wait, Brandt and Benscoter are busy grafting wood cuttings from the newly discovered “lost” apple trees onto root stocks and updating their records from the last season. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Their nonprofit took a major hit when they had to cancel both an annual fair where they sell newly grafted “lost” apple trees and a class on how to graft wood to grow a new apple tree because of the new coronavirus. The two events fund much of their $10,000 annual budget that goes toward travel costs, apple shipping and apple identification.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Two months ago, I was thinking: ‘This is going to be great. We’ve got 10 varieties that have been rediscovered,’ but .... right now, we couldn’t pay our bills,\" Benscoter said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, the self-described apple detectives take comfort in their work as they navigate today’s unprecedented times and find inspiration in imagining the lives of the pioneers who planted these trees. About 25% of homesteads didn't make it, Brandt said, and many settlers died or simply walked away to avoid starvation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was a hard life. I can’t even imagine what they went through, but they survived and they went on with their lives,” he said. “It's hard now, too, but it's going to be OK. It's all a part of life.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Find the Lost Apple Project on Facebook at \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lostappleproject/\">www.facebook.com/lostappleproject/\u003c/a>\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Lost Apples-New Finds","headline":"10 pioneer-era apple types thought extinct found in US West","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:4b08b6e30cbe37697120466d56f294a5","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"4b08b6e30cbe37697120466d56f294a5_2a28aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":"’t know how we’re going to keep up with that.”\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"revision":null,"mediumIds":["853a7192e3f64fa5a2ddcffa1935694a","b977e05080f94885b09185d1f323a8be","1258f203d4384d73b0f00057ed87e00e","ec5e5d53917242638d4fa798eaed2d30","c26879b69cec4b5298312db95055e52e","848ea508e4384040a31002bf152178de","a8e973370f61441caff4c3cfbaecf5ef","96ff58dcb80c46c9ab95660cae3e42a9"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/853a7192e3f64fa5a2ddcffa1935694a/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"In this Oct. 23, 2019, photo, apples collected by amateur botanists David Benscoter and EJ Brandt of the Lost Apple Project, rest on the ground in an orchard at an abandoned homestead near Genesee, Idaho.

But this scraggly specimen produces the Arkansas Beauty, a so-called heritage fruit long believed to be extinct until amateur botanists in the Pacific Northwest tracked it down three years ago.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s one of 13 long-lost apple varieties rediscovered by a pair of retirees in the remote canyons, wind-swept fields and hidden ravines of what was once the Oregon Territory.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>E.J. Brandt and David Benscoter, who together form the nonprofit Lost Apple Project, log countless hours and hundreds of miles in trucks, on all-terrain vehicles and on foot to find orchards planted by settlers as they pushed west more than a century ago.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The two are racing against time to preserve a slice of homesteader history: The apple trees are old, and many are dying. Others are being ripped out for more wheat fields or housing developments for a growing population.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“To me, this area is a goldmine,” said Brandt, who has found two lost varieties in the Idaho panhandle. “I don’t want it lost in time. I want to give back to the people so that they can enjoy what our forefathers did.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='86255a29f6204a609c72d8bd847fe2c5' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Brandt and Benscoter scour old county fair records, newspaper clippings and nursery sales ledgers to figure out which varieties existed in the area. Then they hunt them down, matching written records with old property maps, land deeds and sometimes the memories of the pioneers’ great-grandchildren. They also get leads from people who live near old orchards.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The task is huge. North America once had 17,000 named varieties of domesticated apples, but only about 4,000 remain. The Lost Apple Project believes settlers planted a few hundred varieties in their corner of the Pacific Northwest alone.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Homestead Act of 1862 gave 160 acres (65 hectares) to families who would improve the land and pay a small fee, and these newcomers planted orchards with enough variety to get them through the long winter, with apples that ripened from early spring until the first frosts. Then, as now, trees planted for eating apples were not raised from seeds; cuttings taken from existing trees were grafted onto a generic root stock and raised to maturity. These cloned trees remove the genetic variation that often makes “wild” apples inedible — so-called “spitters.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Benscoter, who retired in 2006 after a career as an FBI agent and an IRS criminal investigator, pursues leads on lost apples with the same zeal he applied to his criminal cases.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In one instance, he found county fair records that listed winners for every apple variety growing in Whitman County, Washington, from 1900 to 1910 — an invaluable treasure map. In another, he located a descendant of a homesteader with a gigantic orchard by finding a family history she posted online.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"a318a0fcf2994770803abea375ee4833\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Once he discovers a forgotten orchard, Benscoter spends hours mapping it. He has pages of diagrams with a tiny circle denoting each tree, with GPS coordinates alongside each dot. A lengthy computer database lists apples including the Shackleford, the Flushing Spitzenburg and the Dickinson— all varieties rediscovered by the project.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Apples from newly discovered trees are placed in a Ziploc baggie and carefully labeled with the tree’s latitude and longitude and the date the fruit was collected. The apples are then shipped to the Temperate Orchard Conservancy more than 400 miles (640 kilometers) away in Molalla, Oregon, for identification.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There, experts work to identify them using a trove of U.S. Agriculture Department watercolors and old textbooks. Once a variety is identified as “lost,” the apple detectives return to the field to take cuttings that can be grafted onto root stock and planted in the conservancy’s vast orchard, to be preserved for future generations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The trees could eventually boost genetic diversity among modern-day apple crops as climate change and disease take an increasing toll, said Joanie Cooper, a botanist at the Temperate Orchard Conservancy who’s helped identify many of the lost varieties found in northern Idaho and eastern Washington.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She and two others founded the nonprofit conservancy in 2011, and operate it on a shoestring, after recognizing the need for a repository for rare fruit trees in the U.S. West.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You have to have varieties that can last, that can grow, produce fruit, survive the heat and maybe survive the cold winter, depending on where you are,” Cooper said. “I think that’s critical.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>For Benscoter and Brandt, however, the biggest joy comes in the hunt.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"b52ded05664f476e8585bdadd3410099\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Brandt, a Vietnam veteran and passionate historian, last year found a homestead near Troy, Idaho, by matching names on receipts from a nursery ledger with old property maps. Three wind-bent apple trees neatly spaced along the edge of a wheat field were all that remained of the orchard.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Brandt collected the apples, hoping one was the Enormous Pippin, a lost variety he saw listed in the sales ledger.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Months later, he learned he had instead found the Regmalard, a yellowish apple with vibrant red splashes on its speckled skin. It hadn’t even been on his radar.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s a lot of footwork and a lot of book work and a lot of computer work.
