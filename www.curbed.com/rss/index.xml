    <title>The best shoe racks and organizers, according to professional organizers </title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="Huge shelf of shoes in cubbies." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3eyuOLSbWU3zYo2zSGzHVuFQGu8=/0x150:1200x1050/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66680521/13_shoe_organizer_lede.w700.h700.2x.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Options for all kinds of spaces&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Wyu8NO"&gt;Whether you’re a sneakerhead or a Manolo devotee, you’ve likely grappled with the &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-home-organization-ideas-products.html"&gt;question of how to store&lt;/a&gt; all of your precious shoes in a &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/strategist/article/how-to-organize-a-tiny-apartment.html"&gt;cramped city apartment&lt;/a&gt;. Under the bed just won’t do, and a jumble of mismatched pairs cluttering your entryway isn’t a great look either. To find the best &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/strategist/2017/11/best-storage-bins-baskets-boxes-professional-organizers.html"&gt;storage solutions&lt;/a&gt; that also keep your shoes in tip-top shape, we spoke to 16 professional organizers all throughout New York City (and one in Raleigh) for their recommendations. Below, 21 of their favorite boxes, shelves, racks, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="QDUJ52"&gt;Best overall shoe organizers&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pink flat shoes in a clear plastic box." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_CMIEwvWCCFZEGfWB0uQryeDuns=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913568/CS_clear_box_small.nocrop.w600.h2147483647.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yCw7FU"&gt;These clear-plastic shoeboxes from the Container Store were the most recommended storage solution by our organization experts. “We never encourage clients to keep shoes in their original shoeboxes,” says Jamie Hord of &lt;a href="http://horderly.com/"&gt;Horderly Professional Organizing&lt;/a&gt;. “Clear, uniform shoeboxes let you see exactly what you have, maximize your space, and give you an aesthetic look in your closet that makes it impossible to mess up.” They work for both shoes that are worn regularly and ones that need to be stored for the off-season. They’re also stackable. “You want to mimic creating shelves in some way,” says Amanda Wiss, founder of &lt;a href="https://www.urbanclarity.net/"&gt;Urban Clarity&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="http://www.apartmentjeanie.com/"&gt;Apartment Jeanie&lt;/a&gt;’s Jeanie Engelbach recommends utilizing the height of the closet to store shoes. They’re also easy to label, and Jeni Aron of &lt;a href="http://cluttercowgirl.com/"&gt;Clutter Cowgirl&lt;/a&gt; says, “If you’re done with a pair of shoes, you can use the box for something else not even shoe related (bathroom, kitchen, pet stuff, meds, etc.).” They come in standard, large, and tall sizes (for heels), but can get pricey if you need a bunch of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4RG2EN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"The Container Store Our Shoe Box","description":"Also available in packs of 5 and 20.","label":"$2 at the Container Store","url":"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1611974&amp;amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fs%2Four-shoe-box%2Fd%3FproductId%3D10001753"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Stack of clear boxes with shoes inside." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bpdqxCLzcaaD67pVCRjhL2hWuHI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913575/CS_drop_front_women.w600.h396.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gz13h6"&gt;Here’s something similar from the Container Store that three of our experts also highly recommend. “I love these boxes because you don’t have to unstack them to get the pair of shoes you want,” says Emily Matles of &lt;a href="http://emaginesimplicity.com/"&gt;Emagine Simplicity&lt;/a&gt;. Hord agrees: “These drop-front shoeboxes create an exact home for every shoe with super-easy access and give your closet a beautiful, yet functional, aesthetic.” Jessica Decker of &lt;a href="http://becomeorganized.net/"&gt;Become Organized&lt;/a&gt; also likes these because “the closed drawer keeps shoes protected from dust, while small ventilation holes allow shoes to breathe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IlehNA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"The Container Store Women’s Drop-Front Shoe Box","description":"Also available in pack of 6.","label":"$8 at The Container Store","url":"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1611974&amp;amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fs%2Fsmall-drop-front-shoe-box%2Fd%3Fq%3Ddrop-front%26productId%3D10037226"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h4 id="gV6nkh"&gt;Best over-the-door shoe organizers&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shoes in an organizer hanging over the roof. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7LtFqQcCgOpyA3wIwsFGJUA4V4s=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913576/CS_door.nocrop.w600.h2147483647.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zuZBrW"&gt;For an organization system that’s more out of the way, four of our experts recommend sticking them on the back of a door. “In my opinion, the best place for shoes (in terms of space-saving) is on the back of a door or inside a closet door,” says Tori Cohen of &lt;a href="https://www.toritheorganizer.com/"&gt;Tori the Organizer&lt;/a&gt;. Decker agrees: “An over-the-door shoe organizer is the easiest, simplest way to store shoes. It goes up in a second and can hold 24 pairs of shoes in an otherwise unused space.” Nicole Abramovici of &lt;a href="http://www.geniusorganizing.com/"&gt;Genius Organizing&lt;/a&gt; notes that the average shoe bag accommodates only 12 pairs, but “this gem has 24 pockets [and fits] one pair per pocket, meaning 24 pairs are up in there. Life-changing!” Natalie Schier, president and founder of &lt;a href="http://www.cut-the-clutter.com/"&gt;Cut the Clutter&lt;/a&gt;, also recommends this particular style for heels or chunkier shoes. To make this organizer look a little more appealing, professional organizer &lt;a href="http://www.annsullivan.com/"&gt;Ann Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; suggests using decorative nails or small hooks to mount it on doors instead of using the over-the-door hooks that comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ek9wTe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"24-Pocket Over the Door Shoe Organizer","description":"Includes&amp;amp;nbsp;over the door hooks.","label":"$30 at The Container Store","url":"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1611974&amp;amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fs%2Fcloset%2Fshoe-storage%2F24-pocket-over-the-door-shoe-organizer%2F12d%3FproductId%3D10036726"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Door to a closet with an organizer hanging on the door." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rA4y3Vi1akuN6ByhOgxNGIMBmck=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913579/over_the_door.w600.h600.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GXAFCO"&gt;This one is even simpler (and less expensive), and it’s Schier’s pick for flats, sandals, and sneakers. “The clear pockets mean you can quickly spot the shoes you want to wear,” she says. “It’s also super easy to mount this rack directly to the inside of a door or even a wall. I use it with my clients not just for shoes, but for winter accessories, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="nIAOFd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"24-Pocket PEVA Over the Door Shoe Bag","description":"Overdoor hooks sold separately.","label":"$12 at The Container Store","url":"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1611974&amp;amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fs%2Fcloset%2Fshoe-storage%2F24-pocket-peva-over-the-door-shoe-bag%2F12d%3FproductId%3D10000120"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Organizer hanging over door with ledges for shoes. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hg9DXQR5AM1xdsUEGnEyRd2exxw=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913581/whitmore_over_door.w600.h396.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cD2nsc"&gt;Another over-the-door option is this nifty organizer that &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-over-the-door-shoe-rack-whitmore-review.html"&gt;Lauren Levy wrote about&lt;/a&gt;, and is “the rare hanging option that doesn’t involve any pockets.” While it takes more assembly than one with pouches, “the benefit is that it comfortably carries both heels and flats,” she says, “and it won’t suffocate shoe leather, a material that requires sufficient breathing room to stay fresh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9sccgy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Whitmor 36-Pair Over the Door Shoe Rack","description":"No-tool assembly.","label":"$33 at Amazon","url":"https://amzn.to/3ezLmeh"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h4 id="2azYfz"&gt;Best shoe-cubby systems&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shoe cubby system. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U0i4yu-Za8V8SpXpUk8VX_47C8k=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913582/CS_cubby.nocrop.w600.h2147483647.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qC1ZxF"&gt;For those who prefer to keep shoes contained in their own compartments, try this simple cubby system recommended by &lt;a href="https://www.lisatselebidis.com/"&gt;Lisa Tselebidis&lt;/a&gt;, a KonMari-certified consultant. “This minimalist cubby organizer can be placed anywhere in the home, whether in the entryway or in a closet,” she says. “You can put two or more of these together and create as large of a shoe organizer as you need.” Sullivan also recommends a similar system and notes that it is “great for a mudroom,” and “if you don’t want to do built-ins or have the budget for them.” Amelia Meena of &lt;a href="http://appleshinenyc.com/"&gt;Appleshine&lt;/a&gt; is also a fan: “I love using them for flats or sneakers — sometimes heels can be a bit tricky if they’re too high.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fIBVsm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"The Container Store 12-Pair Shoe Organizer","description":"Also suitable for small purses.","label":"$40 at The Container Store","url":"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1611974&amp;amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fs%2Fcloset%2Fshoe-storage%2F12-pair-shoe-organizer%2F12d%3FproductId%3D10008147"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A brown shelf with lots of holes for shoes. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2GkvP2NkXBfT0iQZbTIbHSqVQC0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913591/Prepac.w600.h600.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l81Prf"&gt;To display all of your shoes in a streamlined manner, Kadi Dulude of &lt;a href="http://wizardofhomes.com/"&gt;Wizard of Homes&lt;/a&gt; recommends this tall cubby cabinet that can hold 36 pairs of footwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Jg7HxM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Prepac 36 Pair Shoe Storage Rack","description":"Non-toxic laminate.","label":"$181 at Amazon","url":"https://amzn.to/2xBGNjf"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h4 id="CYGTXf"&gt;Best shoe racks&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Small rack for shoes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3NY3drNo1QvHXDCw3iIB6o6A4Fc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913594/Grippy_rack.w600.h396.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nXmRkz"&gt;Three of our experts — Anna Bauer of &lt;a href="http://sortedbyanna.com/"&gt;Sorted by Anna&lt;/a&gt;, Schier, and &lt;a href="https://organizewithkelley.com/"&gt;Kelley Jonkoff&lt;/a&gt;, a certified KonMari consultant based in Raleigh — swear by this expanding rack with grippy, offset bars. “The foam coating is KEY,” says Schier. “It keeps the shoes from slipping off the rack.” Jonkoff calls out its adjustable width, which she says is nice if you move often. “Moving is expensive enough without having to replace your things to fit your new smaller or larger space,” she says. “I’ve had a similar design to this for over ten years and it’s still going strong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xDPEN2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"The Container Store Walnut 3-Tier Grippy Shoe Rack","description":"Hardwood frame.","label":"$30 at The Container Store","url":"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1611974&amp;amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fs%2Fcloset%2Fshoe-storage%2Fwalnut-3-tier-grippy-shoe-rack%2F12d%3FproductId%3D10022384"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Metal rack." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xaZphJUnI-BKisO8hjB4LKgPyjA=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913599/home_bi_stackable_rack.w600.h396.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QYVVS6"&gt;Straightforward shoe racks are also great for decluttering spaces like entryways. “They may be basic, but they get the job done,” says Matles. “They’re ideal for adding more shoe storage in your &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-closet-organizers-closet-storage-ideas.html"&gt;closet &lt;/a&gt;or by your entryway.” This one from Homebi is stackable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="n9Fdkw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Homebi 6-Tier Shoe Rack","description":"Fits 20 pairs.","label":"$25 at Amazon","url":"https://amzn.to/34T0b7a"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two-tier white rack for shoes. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HikE-lt1rKGDS9Xzonx0okI8T8w=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913604/container_store_white_mesh_rack.nocrop.w600.h2147483647.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BIcMAd"&gt;Hord’s go-to pick for shoe organization is this stackable mesh rack. “We love this shoe-rack solution for many reasons. One big reason is that it has straight, solid shelves,” she says. Another is the fact that it stacks, which means maximizing vertical space. You can even fit an extra row of shoes on the floor below the bottom shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uYAmT8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"The Container Store White 2-Tier Stackable Mesh Shoe Shelf","description":"No-tools assembly.","label":"$30 at The Container Store","url":"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1611974&amp;amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fs%2Fcloset%2Fshoe-storage%2Fwhite-2-tier-stackable-mesh-shoe-shelf%2F12d%3FproductId%3D11009939"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bamboo shoe rack." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w2mGihZ-RoDuzGGLmXO7Q9U06ik=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913606/honey_can_do.w600.h600.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="62ICKg"&gt;Jonkoff also likes this one made out of bamboo because it not only provides storage, but also “creates a visually pleasing, calm environment.” She’s partial to storing shoes on a slight slant with the toes facing out, and this three-tier shelf “helps make the shoe more visible, making footwear choices easier,” she adds. “To go full-Kondo for a minute, having the toes facing forward creates a sense of facing the day and the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZQUhkf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Honey-Can-Do Bamboo 3-Tier Shoe Shelf","description":"Holds up to 12 pairs.","label":"$31 at Amazon","url":"https://amzn.to/2xKgKpW"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two-tier wood and metal shoe rack." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GMrclRPJbyGIwjrskSGDWawx0vI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913609/WE.nocrop.w600.h2147483647.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NYFTFh"&gt;Barbara Reich of &lt;a href="http://www.resourcefulconsultants.com/"&gt;Resourceful Consultants&lt;/a&gt; likes the West Elm shoe rack — which is definitely a splurge — for “its simple, clean aesthetic,” she says. “It is a neutral addition to any entryway.” The industrial-looking rack is made from mango wood and steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rBcsqY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"West Elm Industrial Shoe Rack","description":"Mango wood and steel.","label":"$127 at West Elm","url":"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1611974&amp;amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westelm.com%2Fproducts%2Findustrial-shoe-rack-d3810"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Metal racks holding shoes and clothing." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJx8NQu4RwIzffDianYE1nnS61o=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913610/rolling_rack.w600.h600.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk2WBl"&gt;According to Jonkoff, “This rack is ideal for someone with a large shoe collection and a small, multiuse space.” Made from chrome-plated steel with ten tiers and nonslip bars, it can hold up to 50 pairs of women’s shoes of various styles, and because it’s tall, it doesn’t create too large a footprint. It also has wheels, which Jonkoff says is “perfect for a closetless room” because it “can be rolled out of the way when company is over or anytime their usual space is needed for something else.” And the fact that it looks a bit industrial can be plus: “When I’m helping a client organize their clothing, I tell them we’re going to make their closet feel like a boutique.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Eoi4Rs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Chrome Metal 10-Tier Rolling Shoe Rack","description":"Holds up to 50 pairs.","label":"$60 at The Container store","url":"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1611974&amp;amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fs%2Fcloset%2Fshoe-storage%2Fchrome-metal-10-tier-rolling-shoe-rack%2F12d%3FproductId%3D10029931"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h4 id="m6rPdT"&gt;Best shoe stackers&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="White object for stacking shoes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lzzk4sJ6kIlnMEJtknVlf9YmVI8=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913617/Shoe_Slotz.w600.h396.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sGVhWU"&gt;To squeeze even more space out of your shelves, Decker suggests trying these Shoe Slotz that “increase storage space and prevent shoes from getting damaged sitting on top of each other.” They’re similar to ones that Strategist contributor Alison Freer &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/strategist/article/harra-home-shoe-slot-review.html"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt;, which she says are “like individual two-story condos for every single pair of footwear.” She continues: “As everyone on the island of Manhattan knows, the Golden Rule of creating more space is always to go up rather than out, and because the Shoe Slotz allow me to stack two shoes on top of each other within the same footprint, I essentially halve the amount of space each pair takes up on my shoe racks.” Schier also uses &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516509&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fs%2Fshoe-space-savers-package-of-6%2Fd%3FproductId%3D11003520%26q%3Dshoe%2520space%2520saver&amp;amp;referrer=curbed.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.curbed.com%2F2020%2F4%2F20%2F21224211%2Fbest-shoe-racks-organizers-professional-organizers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;something similar&lt;/a&gt;, saying, “They are a game changer for sandals and flats. They literally double the amount of shoes you can store on a flat rack or on the floor.” Schier adds &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cabinet-Diameter-Adhesive-Cabinets-Dampening/dp/B07NM1P2F6/?ascsubtag=%5B%5Dst%5Bp%5Dcjm0lkmew017ka8ye979iu6vy%5Bd%5DD%5Bz%5Dm%5Bt%5Dw&amp;amp;tag=thestrategistsite-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rubber bumpers&lt;/a&gt; to the bottoms to keep them from sliding around on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v33fC5"&gt;Vertical fabric cubbies are another great hanging option for utilizing limited space in a closet. Just attach it to the rod off to the side and you instantly have designated room for your shoes. Dulude recommends this canvas organizer that holds a surprising number of shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AxEBb7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Whitmor 30-Section Hanging Shoe Shelves","description":"Includes metal hooks.","label":"$26 at Amazon","url":"https://amzn.to/3evJGm2"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h4 id="2PXgeu"&gt;Best closed-storage shoe organizers&lt;/h4&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Cream-colored organizer." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MZDpRq07TTF122cmsR2Rh0ysxHE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913622/Ikea_Trones.w600.h396.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qJNwGJ"&gt;For those who want their shoes completely out of sight, our experts Bauer and Matles both recommend Ikea’s Trones system, which “is slim and compact and can be used in various areas of your home,” according to Bauer. Matles likes that it “fits perfectly on a wall in a narrow space and keep shoes off the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2qwjoA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Ikea Trones (Set of 2)","description":"Must be secured to wall. ","label":"$25 at Amazon","url":"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/trones-shoe-storage-cabinet-white-00397307/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="White cabinet with sliding door hiding shelves." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bzs5nPrEdTUtqmsvjhDjSdd1s4o=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913624/Ikea_Mackapar.nocrop.w600.h2147483647.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zEY4fQ"&gt;Here’s another Ikea solution that keeps shoes concealed behind a sliding door. “This Ikea shoe cabinet is great for a small space and perfect to keep in a hallway by the front door,” says Aron. “If you have the height, you can stack one cabinet on top of the other and store less frequently used shoes and other accessories up top.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FD0n7a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Ikea Mackapar Shoe Cabinet","description":"Shelves can be mounted flat or angled.","label":"$70 at Ikea ","url":"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/mackapaer-shoe-storage-cabinet-white-50334751/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h4 id="B01IIa"&gt;Best seating with shoe storage&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tufted bench with storage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/07vQQ8t1BzqGVVlnJcfINuPLiAo=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913625/ottoman.w600.h396.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7vTgzb"&gt;“If closet space is an issue and you don’t quite have the space for a shoe cubby, then an ottoman would be a great solution,” says Dulude. This one is made of microfiber and includes interior side pockets for even more storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HxQnPY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Linon Carmen Shoe Storage Ottoman","description":"Also available in beige.","label":"$137 at Amazon","url":"https://amzn.to/34Rrdff"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aGNUlg"&gt;Juli Oliver of &lt;a href="http://organizeny.com/"&gt;OrganizeNY&lt;/a&gt; recommends this bench with shelves that makes it easy to put on your shoes — and put them away when you’re done. Perfect for a mudroom or an entryway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wjBuO9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Convenience Concepts Designs4Comfort Utility Mudroom Bench","description":"Available in 8 colors.","label":"$53 at Amazon","url":"https://amzn.to/2XRuf1y"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h4 id="XROn86"&gt;Best storage for boots&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Hangers for boots. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/40-QPpM_XyTKmoN9J44I3IrMAYI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913628/Boot_hanger.w600.h396.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RyB5hr"&gt;Storing boots—especially tall boots—is trickier because of their shafts and how much real estate they take up. And because they’re often made of “supple leather or suedes,” as Engelbach noted, they need a little extra TLC to keep fresh. If you have extra space in your closet, Bauer and Engelbach suggest hanging them with these handy clip hangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="p6nk4a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"The Original Boot Hanger","description":"Set of 3.","label":"$25 at Amazon","url":"https://amzn.to/3bkpEch"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Boots held in shape by paper inserts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FzCaNWIe3MYsSz__RG80H3oXQDU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913630/voot_boot.w600.h396.2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zWg2VH"&gt;Schier recommends Voot Boot Shapers to help keep “tall boots from flopping over and ending up in a jumbled mess,” which ultimately makes them easier to store. They’re essentially flexible plastic sheets that you roll up and insert into the shaft. They store flat when you’re not using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QWQNaf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Voot Boot Shaper - Prima","description":"Fits most below-the-knee boots.","label":"$13 at Amazon","url":"https://amzn.to/2Kn9tPD"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LXIgMj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k194nm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4xCxt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMkXv0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jh8BsF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFTc10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIa56I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uc2VQz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FE7Whp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9hIwV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4Sj1x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPpgQQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>21 easy home projects to tackle without buying a thing</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="An illustration of orange, white, and red dishes stacked up. There is a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tBEkIej64wAqkXSdB6Cntq5-LPQ=/417x0:3084x2000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66553423/PS_12_header_FINAL.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;Level up your spaces without buying anything new&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="gcUFzy"&gt;As the U.S. confronts the spread of the novel coronavirus, &lt;a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2020/3/20/21187022/coronavirus-new-york-shutdown-shelter-in-place"&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://sf.curbed.com/2020/3/16/21182152/san-francisco-bay-area-shelter-in-place-coronavirus"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://la.curbed.com/2020/3/18/21185808/coronavirus-los-angeles-shutdown-shelter-in-place"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://chicago.curbed.com/2020/3/13/21178824/coronavirus-chicago-closures-shelter-in-place"&gt;country&lt;/a&gt; has now implemented &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/us/coronavirus-which-states-stay-at-home-order-trnd/index.html"&gt;stay-at-home orders&lt;/a&gt;. And while we grapple with how &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/4/17/21213899/rent-forgiveness-ilhan-omar-squad-housing"&gt;to pay rent&lt;/a&gt;, whether we’re &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2019/8/29/20837282/millennials-recession-homebuying-prices-coronavirus"&gt;headed into a recession&lt;/a&gt;, and how the virus is &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/3/6/21163523/coronavirus-economic-impact-housing-market"&gt;impacting the housing market&lt;/a&gt;, we’re also left with a more basic question: What should we do while we’re stuck at home? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuLpjH"&gt;There’s only so much &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/comfort-shows-binge-watch-coronavirus-quarantine.html"&gt;comfort TV to binge-watch&lt;/a&gt; before restlessness kicks in, so for those of us that are able, this extended time indoors is an opportunity to tackle those long-avoided home projects. Of course, now is &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/epg75n/bored-people-flooding-best-buy-office-depot-lowes-sherwin-williams-during-coronavirus"&gt;not the time to flock to the stores for nonessential items&lt;/a&gt;, so we’ve gathered a list of ways you can upgrade your space with things you probably already have at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjkziM"&gt;From restyling your bookshelves to prepping your planters for spring, here are 21 easy projects you can do while social distancing at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UajN5O"&gt;Rearrange things for a fresh perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6X5As"&gt;Renovating your entire living room or splurging on a new bedroom set likely isn’t in the cards at the moment, but that doesn’t mean you can’t make some changes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three tall white bookshelves full of colorful books stand next to a white wall. A black carpet with gold stars is on the foreground." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DztB9mN6-1jy2zks5S7LIukoHK4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19832394/House_Calls_Bainbridge_Au_NY_bookshelf.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Winnie Au&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C8ed5m"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a new furniture layout:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s easy to get in a rut with the same ol’ furniture setup, but what if you tried something new? Move the couch to a different wall, adjust where your armchair sits, or mix things up by swapping rugs from one room to another. Even switching a lamp from a side table to another spot in your house could brighten up a space in new ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIFFz7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring out the “special occasion” dinnerware:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s no better time to add a bit of drama to your table, so bust out the china, special silverware, or fancy wine glasses. Now that we’re all eating at home, it’s the perfect chance to sip and savor at the dinner table using our favorite pieces. Want to share the fun with a few friends or family? &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/4/14/21200296/virtual-dinner-party-happy-hour-ideas-tips-quarantine"&gt;Try hosting a virtual dinner party&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmhSXi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restyle your bookshelves:&lt;/strong&gt; Even avid readers don’t change up their bookshelves all that often, so now is the time to rethink them. If you’re focused on the literature, arrange your books by alphabetical order or by theme. If aesthetics are the priority, remember &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc93_jCXUEY"&gt;these three tips&lt;/a&gt; from designer Emily Henderson: Declutter, use neutral colors, and focus on a few standout pieces.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="NlG9nU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9172382"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="t0Kznm"&gt;Cleaning projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lmR4k9"&gt;There’s a lot of talk about cleaning these days, and rightly so. But beyond disinfecting all of your high-touch surfaces, it’s also past time to buckle down on the tasks you avoid doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tp28oO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean your vents and baseboards:&lt;/strong&gt; Heating and vent covers accumulate dust over time, and cleaning them can help reduce allergens in your home and increase the efficiency of your air conditioning or heating unit. Vacuum the vents with a dusting brush attachment or wipe with a dry microfiber cloth—avoid using water or other cleaning products, because they can smear the dust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hg0XHP"&gt;You can also unscrew the vent covers and place them in a sink filled with hot, soapy water. But don’t rub them too hard or paint may come off. And while you’re at it, turn your HVAC unit off and change the air filter on your furnace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DfoKh6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go under your bed:&lt;/strong&gt; Vacuuming and cleaning the toilets are usually on the weekly to-do list, but when was the last time you cleaned underneath your bed? Don’t wait until the next time you move to clear out the dirt—move the bed, empty out any storage boxes you might have underneath, and vacuum the dust. Plus: You might be surprised at the things you’ll find (hello, missing phone charger). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ3CQC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean out your bathroom drawers:&lt;/strong&gt; This is another task we put off when we don’t have the time. Our bathroom drawers take a lot of daily abuse; after emptying the drawers you’ll likely find hair, spilled makeup, toothpaste, and so on. Once the insides are free of gunk, toss the junk and reorganize what’s left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pTkEq1"&gt;Organizing &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="B9SAgT"&gt;Where to begin? There’s no shortage of home organization projects that can yield big results, but the options below won’t require a trip to the store. Of course, &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2019/10/17/20872633/storage-ideas-small-spaces-apartments-kitchens"&gt;if you want to buy new storage solutions&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve got you covered there, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A wooden triangular clothes rack hangs by a window. A large plant sits on a blue stool nearby. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zW26Ed6-gvpbgIpp88EQwB13IrE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19832347/House_Calls_Philadelphia_Natto_clothing_rack.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Heidi’s Bridge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ves4OU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tackle the closets:&lt;/strong&gt; Face it: Even the most organized among us can have a messy closet, and now is the time to make it right. Start by taking everything out of the closet, purging what’s no longer used, and cleaning the interior. If it’s a clothes closet, sort your clothes by category and be sure to hang delicate items and stack thicker things like denim. Put your most-used items at the front, while seasonal or rarely used pieces can go up higher or in the back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjZEIp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tidy up the entryway:&lt;/strong&gt; Whether you have a spacious mudroom or a tiny coat stand, things accumulate in our daily life. Reevaluate your hooks: Are they helpful? Hanging at the right height? Do you need more or fewer of them? Vacuum or shake out any door mats you have, then purge any knick knacks or unused items hanging around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGDn2L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Label your supplies:&lt;/strong&gt; A few labels can go a long way in creating a more organized household. Have storage bins or containers in your kitchen pantry, under the bed, or in a linen closet? A label maker works great if you have it, but you can also write on regular paper and tape the labels on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HcNYqX"&gt;Pay attention to your walls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4QLZlX"&gt;Walls may not be the first thing you think of when it comes to home projects, but a few updates can make a big difference. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Framed paintings of various sizes hang on a wall composed of wooden slats. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AxGDI_2NvKfjZEHzHW0sWGhDEvA=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19832334/HouseCalls_StHelena_Jeffers_Purdy_livingroom_fireplace.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Jake Stangel&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vXDMkc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straighten—or redo—your wall hangings:&lt;/strong&gt; From photos to artwork to TVs, the items on our walls become crooked over time. Take a stroll through your house and straighten everything—you’ll be surprised at the difference it makes. Alternatively, take down all of your photos or artwork and make a new gallery, perhaps moving items to a new room to keep things fresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fmef2O"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch up your paint:&lt;/strong&gt; Many of us have a few cans of paint tucked away in our homes, from the last time we did a project or from when we moved in. Make sure it matches your current walls and then walk through the house and touch up the high-use areas, especially door frames, baseboards, and doors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfzJhE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put empty frames to use:&lt;/strong&gt; Photo projects require a ton of time and energy to complete, which means they sometimes never make it off of your to-do list. Go through the house and add photos to any frames you’re not using; alternatively, you could also swap out older photos for new ones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="KJb7D3"&gt;Lighting is one of the most important elements in design, and our homes can go from stark and unwelcoming to cozy and warm just by swapping out a few bulbs. Want to take the next step? Here are &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/2/20/21069539/tips-improve-lighting-without-electrician"&gt;pro tips for improving your home’s lighting&lt;/a&gt;—without an electrician. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Blue gradient curtains flank a tall window. A patterned armchair and wooden side table sit nearby." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8rqGCA5wTuLbe-SBxp8PAllZRCk=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19832359/House_Calls_Craig_Bath_Colston_8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Paul Craig&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ4ePP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace bulbs:&lt;/strong&gt; Have a few extra lightbulbs lying around? Go through the house and replace any that have gone out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWjsTb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean your lamps:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes the culprit to bad lighting isn’t a dead lightbulb, it’s dirt. Unplug lamps and clean the lampshades with a dry microfiber cloth or vacuum cleaner attachment. For other types of lamps, clean the bulbs and use a cloth to dust off the hardware. Note that you should always do this when the light bulbs are cool to the touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7Nxtq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean your curtains:&lt;/strong&gt; Clean curtains can make a room feel much brighter. Most drapery stores advise cleaning your curtains a few times each year, but it’s a task many of us neglect. First, look at your care instructions to determine whether you can wash your curtains or whether they have to be dry cleaned. Velvet drapes can be washed with a chamois cloth dipped in hot water, while silk curtains sometimes call for hand-washing. If you can machine-wash your curtains, use the gentle cycle, cool water, and mild detergent, and hang them to dry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KD3TMJ"&gt;In the kitchen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="UzIT7S"&gt;The kitchen is another area of the home that benefits from special attention; we spend so much time cooking and eating that it can become disorganized quick. Beyond the regular duties of washing dishes or cleaning out the fridge, the tasks below will help your kitchen look better and function more smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bright kitchen with white marble island, white cabinets, and a stainless steel oven. Two bronze pendant lamps hang over the island." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ic9aw0c_WwYW5r2CWlop18516_4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19832324/House_Calls_Chavarri_a_Gutierrez_Maloney_kitchen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Carlos Chavarría&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RKBYjP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moisturize your wooden cutting boards:&lt;/strong&gt; Remember that gorgeous wooden cutting board that you use as a cheese and charcuterie plate? When was the last time you moisturized it? In order to prevent warping or cracking, both wooden cutting boards and spoons should be oiled about once per month. Start by cleaning your boards and letting them dry. Then apply a food-grade oil like mineral oil or beeswax and let it soak in overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iniq3F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take stock of the essentials:&lt;/strong&gt; Clean out your liquor cabinet or spice shelf and figure out what you have and what you might be missing. There’s no way to know if you have three bottles of cumin or a few versions of Cointreau until you take stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eF7U7M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally clean your small appliances:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of us probably clean out the refrigerator and wipe down the stove on a regular basis, but small appliances are often neglected. Hand-wash all of the removable parts of your coffee maker and run a few brewing cycles with distilled water. Empty out your toaster oven or toaster trap door and then shake the appliance over the sink to remove loose crumbs. Deep-clean your Instant Pot by wiping down the inner cooking chamber with a damp dishcloth; washing the silicone sealing ring in hot, soapy water; and running a cycle of water, distilled white vinegar, and a few lemon peels to remove odors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="C1YrRz"&gt;In your yard &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nRTIN8"&gt;Spring has sprung in much of the country, and it’s an ideal time to prep our spaces for summer. Whether you have a small outdoor balcony or a sprawling yard, here are a few places to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A row of plants sit on a wooden table. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e_1b3dZCvFOxL7Gem0Rq1xhOT5Q=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19832414/House_Calls_Los_Angeles_Maxcy_Ranch_Uncommon_Frost_exterior_plants.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sam Frost&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cIVF0h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean up from winter:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a small patio or balcony, grab a broom and sweep off the dirt and dust of the past few months. Larger yards will need a bigger cleanup—start by getting rid of any leaves and pine cones that might have fallen during winter storms, and then prune away dead or damaged branches. Now is also the time to clean up around your perennial plants or shrubs and remove damaged grass areas for spring seeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YY6QQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prep your planters:&lt;/strong&gt; Gather your empty planters—big and small—and clean them so they are ready for planting. Discard any that might have broken at the end of last season, then check for drainage holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMSN3l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrub your outdoor furniture:&lt;/strong&gt; You’d be surprised how much dirt can accumulate on outdoor furniture, even if it’s been in storage. For wood and wicker furniture, use a mild oil-base soap like Murphy Oil mixed with warm water. Other types of furniture do fine with dishwashing liquid mixed in a large bucket of warm water, and many patio cushions can either be wiped down or thrown in the washing machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="D7lm2I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHN8k6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgjF2G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KNRPL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Refreshed midcentury modern asks $825K in Denver </title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="An exterior view of a gray and white midcentury modern home with a carport on the right and green grass in the front.

  &lt;p&gt;A sleek 1955 home with modern updates in the Mile High City &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="soxzYL"&gt;Denver, Colorado, may be most famous for its high-altitude status and &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2019/12/10/20897015/colorado-skiing-best-ski-resorts-towns"&gt;proximity to skiing&lt;/a&gt;, but it also boasts a surprising number of neighborhoods that are packed with midcentury charm. Take &lt;a href="https://www.sothebysrealty.com/eng/sales/detail/180-l-597-5gebww/1321-south-edison-way-denver-co-80222"&gt;this three-bedroom, two-bath home&lt;/a&gt; in Krisana Park. An enclave in the larger Virginia Village neighborhood, Krisana Park is made up of about 170 ranch homes built in the 1950s that looked to Joseph Eichler for design inspiration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="SUmcQE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:2265443"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f3G56b"&gt;The modestly sized homes—the beauty pictured below is 1,608 square feet—feature post-and-beam construction with wide roof overhangs. Tongue-and-groove ceilings and an airy open floorplan are made brighter by floor-to-ceiling east facing windows. Bleached oak flooring throughout creates a streamlined look, and an updated kitchen includes white quartz countertops, a matte charcoal backsplash, and an oversized island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYrxMa"&gt;The bedrooms feature thoughtful window placement and built-out closets, and a new master bath offers spacious double sinks. Outside, you’ll find a back patio with tigerwood inlays, raised garden beds, two car garage, and an additional single carport. Love what you see? &lt;a href="https://www.sothebysrealty.com/eng/sales/detail/180-l-597-5gebww/1321-south-edison-way-denver-co-80222"&gt;1321 South Edison Way is on the market now for $825,000&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Simple brick home comes with enviable courtyard</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="Dining area with wooden table looking out onto courtyard." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n0gGFE-bKcGRGPQsmo4wFDh6daY=/75x0:1408x1000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66677918/Escobedo2.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;small&gt;Sandra Pereznieto&lt;/small&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A little privacy never hurt anyone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="q7hlWT"&gt;This neat brick home on the outskirts of Mexico City was crafted by Mexican architecture firm &lt;a href="https://www.escobedosoliz.net/"&gt;Escobedo Soliz&lt;/a&gt; on a tight budget. The residence’s 1,075 square feet is split between two levels that wrap around a compact courtyard in a C-shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdPNSy"&gt;In addition to brick, volcanic stone sourced from the site is also a star of the material palette, found in the foundation, stairs, and perimeter walls. Meanwhile, a timber beams line the ceiling and steel window frames painted a rust red add a bit of industrial flavor to the space.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Small table in courtyard." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EKFONweEAgE8_bK5o0sVSUXJ-Yk=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19885551/Escobedo6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sandra Pereznieto&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pwbcs9"&gt;From the living room, a door opens onto the patio and has views straight to the kitchen and dining area where there’s another sliding door connecting to the outside. The architects explain that the courtyard was the result of the neighborhood’s booming development. Instead of building a house with a facade facing its neighbors, the interior windows look out onto the courtyard, giving the owner privacy and an enviable place to hold al fresco dinners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Concrete oasis hides gardens galore  </title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="Single-story house with white concrete walls." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7kAfY2gsKiSUMGVIZZaIsQbBoMA=/72x0:1405x1000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66677462/IMG_2880.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;small&gt;Creative Photo Room, Maria Efthymiou&lt;/small&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Plants at every turn &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ekfLmM"&gt;This house in Nicosia, Cyprus, has not one but four gardens, and all of them are “secret.” The designers at &lt;a href="http://draftworks.eu/ch/archives/category/projects#.XpsbEtNKiCQ"&gt;Draftworks Architecture&lt;/a&gt; use that term loosely—the gardens in this house are simply enclosed and enveloped by foliage-covered concrete walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTCdo1"&gt;Inside, the walls are built from concrete masonry units, while the wood and metalwork were made by local craftsman. The designers imbued the hard-edged space with moments of softness thanks to patches of greenery sunken into the floor, which allow the family to grow plants indoors before transplanting them outside&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="View of kitchen and dining area with a patch of indoor garden." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6IK4XxRkmxGDThJu-MGWrFGVams=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19909936/Drafworks3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Creative Photo Room, Maria Efthymiou&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iWmIDd"&gt;A master bedroom and a pair of smaller bedrooms flank the entrance while an open living area, dining ara, and kitchen fill the space to the back. Doors open onto four walled gardens placed on various sides of the house. These green spaces are hidden from view by perforated white-washed concrete walls where just the slightest hint of vines poke through.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Her Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act would provide national housing relief throughout the crisis&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="dvwae5"&gt;Many Americans are currently wondering if they’ll be able to pay rent. One legislator believes, as long as the economy is disrupted by the coronavirus, they shouldn’t have to worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nf7MD5"&gt;Rep. Ilhan Omar’s &lt;a href="https://omar.house.gov/sites/omar.house.gov/files/Bill%20Text%20-%20Rent%20and%20Mortgage%20Cancellation%20Act%5B1%5D.pdf"&gt;Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act&lt;/a&gt;, announced today during a virtual press conference, would move beyond many of the rent relief measures being introduced by cities and states, and provide nationwide full-payment forgiveness. The bill would guarantee no negative impact on the credit rating or rental history of any renters or homeowners during the length of the crisis, and the legislation also includes a relief fund for &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/3/31/21197368/coronavirus-rent-mortgage-landlord-apartment"&gt;landlords&lt;/a&gt; or mortgage holders to cover losses from cancelled payments. In addition, the bill would create a fund to fully finance the purchase of privately owned rental property by non-profits, public housing authorities, cooperatives, and community land trusts, to help increase the amount of available affordable housing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzcEpZ"&gt;“We must take major action to protect the health and economic security of the most vulnerable, including the millions of Americans currently at risk of housing instability and homelessness,” says Rep. Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota. “Congress has a responsibility to step in to stabilize both local communities and the housing market during this time of uncertainty and crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ4ezy"&gt;The bill is cosponsored by a number of progressive Democrats including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal, Mark Pocan, Ayanna Pressley, Veronica Escobar, Jesús “Chuy” García, and Grace Meng. It does not as of yet include exact figures for the size of the relief fund, though it would be administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZymR6R"&gt;Omar’s rent forgiveness legislation comes as tenants across the country struggle to pay rent due to unprecedented job losses stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. The National Multifamily Housing Council released a report showing that 12 percent fewer Americans paid rent in April than they did in March, and many tenant groups and organizers are &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/4/1/21201051/pay-rent-april-strike-coronavirus"&gt;considering rent strikes&lt;/a&gt; leading into May 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCtmMN"&gt;Omar has previously been very active around housing reform and legislation. Her &lt;a href="https://omar.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-ilhan-omar-introduces-homes-all-act-new-21st-century-public-housing-vision"&gt;Homes for All Act&lt;/a&gt;, introduced last November, proposed a radical $1 trillion investment in upgrading and expanding the nation’s public housing stock. It has since been included in the &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/1/29/21112405/aoc-squad-peoples-housing-platform-congress-legislation-housing"&gt;People’s Housing Platform&lt;/a&gt;, a slate of housing legislation pushed by progressive lawmakers including &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2019/9/25/20882120/aoc-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-just-society-legislation-housing"&gt;Ocasio-Cortez&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the Squad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LS3nt2"&gt;Such bills have been proposed at the local level in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/coronavirus/no-rent-for-3-months-san-jose-to-consider-covid-19-response-plan-for-tenants/2268462/"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2020/3/30/21200066/coronavirus-new-york-rent-freeze-cuomo-covid-19"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, and have been met with fierce opposition by the landlord industry. Many property owners, especially &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/3/31/21197368/coronavirus-rent-mortgage-landlord-apartment"&gt;mom-and-pop landlords&lt;/a&gt;, have voiced concern that any rent forgiveness plans that don’t compensate property owners will make it impossible for them to pay their expenses and mortgages, and will lead to larger problems in the financial and banking industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KauneF"&gt;“Due to layoffs and mass unemployment, even more renters are making choices between food and rent, accruing debts, and at risk of being forced from their homes,” says Tara Raghuveer, People’s Action’s Homes Guarantee Campaign Director, in a statement. “The Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act offers the only solution that can meet the scale and depth of our immediate needs related to housing, and establish a new framework for long-term recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arched concrete home extension was designed for drama</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="Concrete house with large barrel arch." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kGqnapHRHIGGPBfs_FhXSLXS27s=/296x0:2069x1330/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66667965/Fabian_Tan1.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;small&gt;Ceavs Chua&lt;/small&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Curves built to stand out&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="o7C3jx"&gt;When a young family enlisted architect &lt;a href="http://www.fabian-tan.com/"&gt;Fabian Tan&lt;/a&gt; to build an extension to its suburban house in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the directive was to make it stand out from its neighbors. With a soaring barrel arch constructed from cast concrete and massive wooden doors that make even the tallest person look miniature, we can safely say that Tan accomplished that mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOSUu8"&gt;The new volume extends the original L-shaped house, creating a hard to miss contrast between the curved and the orthogonal. “The new form is intended to be simple but bold, contrasting with the existing fabric of tropical suburban homes,” Tan told &lt;a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2020/04/14/barrel-vaulted-concrete-bewboc-house-extension-fabian-tan-architect/"&gt;Dezeen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Woman sitting on second story concrete terrace with feet dangling off side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NGoZo6lzOegfhkn_VXQ7ZRxGZWw=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19907724/Fabian_Tan7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Ceavs Chua&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9lG0vL"&gt;The extension is all arch, from front to back. Its tall ceiling creates a spacious living and dining room on the ground floor, while a mezzanine provides space for another lounging area and a master bedroom with a rather precarious-looking terrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OXKSK"&gt;Working with the curvy shape allowed Tan to build some playfulness into the space. The upstairs window, for example, is cut into a half-moon shape and inverted, presenting a nifty optical illusion in the form of an S. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A sophisticated take on the rammed earth house</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="Flat-roofed rammed earth house sitting on hill. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E71kIqts8uEUNu6nePDRnVHbgt0=/243x0:1339x822/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66667298/Arquipe_lago_Arquitetos5.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;small&gt;Federico Cairoli&lt;/small&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Built from the ancient construction technique, this Brazilian home is anything but unrefined&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CqR9qL"&gt;Rammed earth construction might be an &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/3/2/21157792/rammed-earth-homes-the-art-of-earth-architecture"&gt;ancient technique&lt;/a&gt;, but this house in Cunha, Brazil, is an example of how the building method can be modernized to gorgeous effect. Brazilian studio &lt;a href="http://arquipelago.co/"&gt;Arquipélago Arquitetos&lt;/a&gt; built the home on top of a hill with a warm terra cotta-hued facade constructed from the soil it sits on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjwLVX"&gt;The exterior is roughly clad in panels of rammed earth that stand without any metal formwork support, ensuring the construction process was as sustainable as possible. The walls are topped by a flat, wood-grated roof with an overhangs that covers a front porch seating area. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Woman standing on deck seen through a window." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k0g6q2umfQyPTRycHjHvlfYq0sU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19907584/Arquipe_lago_Arquitetos10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Federico Cairoli&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jUlZ47"&gt;Inside, shades of brown—save for a striking pair of teal sofas—form a monochromatic palette that keeps the space soft and cozy. Walls are built from brick, and timber slats line the ceiling. This warm neutral palette is consistent down to the details—the bathrooms have copper pipe shower heads, and rust-colored pendants hang over the tables.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coronavirus stimulus: Where’s the New Deal for a post-pandemic America?</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="A poster showing two laborers shaking hands, part of a program in the 1930s to promote the WPA." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wCb5TUnULfCcZm43-itXq7GHzSY=/0x0:2200x1650/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66664599/GettyImages_90007263.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With 22 million-plus out of work, we need jobs and public-works vision for the future&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="wjFJrx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/heres-why-so-many-planes-are-still-flying-nearly-empty.html"&gt;Air travel has ground to a halt&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2020/3/24/21192454/coronavirus-nyc-transportation-subway-citi-bike-covid-19"&gt;Buses and trains carry just a handful of&lt;/a&gt; riders. Highways and roadways are eerily empty. &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/3/27/21191714/coronavirus-public-spaces-parks-hiking-trails"&gt;Even parks and many public spaces are closed down and cordoned off&lt;/a&gt;. This opening montage of a post-apocalyptic movie is reality today, as the novel coronavirus has caused the infrastructure of urban life to shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NHOJb"&gt;As our cities experience this uncanny, uncertain pause, there may also be a rare opportunity to reflect and rebuild. In a nation reeling from both a pandemic and the worsening &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/covid-19-coronavirus-economy-recession-stock-market"&gt;economic downturn&lt;/a&gt; that’s followed, even trillions of dollars of government intervention and assistance may not be enough. There’s also long-standing, widespread agreement that our infrastructure—from roads and bridges to trains, transit, and water systems—has been straining from overdue maintenance for years (as a country, we &lt;a href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/"&gt;received a D-plus on our last infrastructure report card&lt;/a&gt;). In this time of crisis, why shouldn’t the U.S. replicate one of the largest, most successful government works programs in its history, the Works Progress Administration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4eqwk"&gt;Introduced in 1935 by President Franklin Roosevelt, &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2017/1/19/14268628/trump-infrastructure-plan-new-deal"&gt;the WPA&lt;/a&gt; was a key part of the unprecedented series of employment and public works programs that his administration launched to fight the Depression, collectively known as the New Deal. This constellation of programs, including the Public Works Administration, employed artists and workers, reforested land and erected the Hoover Dam, and left a lasting mark on the Americans landscape (&lt;a href="https://livingnewdeal.org/"&gt;the Living New Deal Atlas catalogues 16,000 sites still standing&lt;/a&gt;). It’s been the yardstick by which subsequent presidents’ public works programs have been judged ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A group of laborers working in New York City as part of the New Deal-era WPA program." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xU1SxscoReyGMTA3F4tfSPqMtN4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19902460/GettyImages_534276064.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TIVBEQ"&gt;Imagine, during the era of social distancing, American transit transformed, with space for cars given over to bike lanes, walking paths, shared streets, and &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2019/6/24/18715939/real-estate-development-walkable-urbanism"&gt;more valuable pedestrian-first infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;. Envision environmental priorities coming first: renewable energy, &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2019/9/19/20872719/green-new-deal-infrastructure-design"&gt;buildings retrofitted to cut carbon emissions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/2/4/21112234/home-power-range-stove-electrification-natural-gas"&gt;eliminate natural gas&lt;/a&gt;. Investments in transit and &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2019/5/15/18617763/affordable-housing-policy-rent-real-estate-apartment"&gt;affordable housing&lt;/a&gt;, at a time when &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/4/8/21209989/coronavirus-rent-housing-pay-rent-strike-landlord"&gt;paying rent is more of a burden than ever&lt;/a&gt;.  We’ve come to &lt;a href="https://la.curbed.com/2020/3/26/21195699/pollution-los-angeles-traffic-coronavirus"&gt;love the clear skies&lt;/a&gt; being attributed to the current coronavirus-led economic slowdown. Let’s invest money and make it permanent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tnymnp"&gt;Right now, there’s a developing bipartisan consensus around the idea that thinking big about infrastructure investment can be part of the solution to coronavirus: &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/490462-infrastructure-bill-gains-new-steam-as-coronavirus-worsens"&gt;both President Donald Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; have expressed interest. While the concept of “infrastructure week” has become a bit of a punchline, since Trump has repeatedly failed to deliver on &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2017/1/19/14268628/trump-infrastructure-plan-new-deal"&gt;early promises of rebuilding the nation&lt;/a&gt;, he and his advisers &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2018/2/12/17003730/trump-infrastructure-plan-funding-road-congress"&gt;have laid out roadmaps and plans for nationwide investments&lt;/a&gt;. Now would be the perfect time to start planning for many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01ZODP"&gt;Imagine the potential of harnessing American workers, many now desperate for employment, for large-scale projects to reshape our cities. What would the U.S. look like with tens of thousands of workers repairing broken roads; constructing new transit, bike, and rail projects; upgrading our energy infrastructure; and building the nation’s next chapter? Imagine &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2019/1/8/18173851/green-new-deal-cities-environment-infrastructure"&gt;the sustainable vision of the Green New Deal,&lt;/a&gt; one already supported by mayors across the county, becoming reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCqRIF"&gt;The nation has seen &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/09/830216099/6-6-million-more-file-for-unemployment-as-coronavirus-keeps-economy-shut"&gt;22 million&lt;/a&gt; apply for unemployment in the last month, an unprecedented number that’s almost assuredly both an undercount and certain to get higher. The only time the nation has dealt with remotely similar numbers was during the Great Depression. At one point in 1933, unemployment hit 24.9 percent, then representing 13 million people. The first New Deal programs were launched in ’33, and over the next few years, the combined public works projects and other programs lowered unemployment to 9.5 million in 1935, then 7.6 million in 1936.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ew9rVI"&gt;“The question on everybody’s mind right now is, how are we going to restart the economy?” says Scott Myers-Lipton, a sociology professor at San Jose State University. “Well, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2009/01/four-million-jobs-in-two-years-fdr-did-it-in-two-months.html"&gt;the WPA once hired 4 million people in two months&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine something like that as a stopgap, a massive public works project that will help us get back to business.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGZWD9"&gt;Any new WPA-style program can’t launch as quickly, due to the pandemic, social-distancing requirements, and need to develop a concrete plan to restart the economy without new surges of infection. But such an infrastructure plan could be developed in concert with a gradual re-opening of the economy. And, in the meantime, &lt;a href="https://www.aia.org/pages/6282364-march-2020-special-report-moving-ahead-cha"&gt;there are plenty of unemployed and underemployed architects, designers, planners, and others&lt;/a&gt; who can begin imagining, planning for, and gaining approvals for forthcoming projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6J2Xg"&gt;“Architects can work from home without skipping a beat,” says Kermit Baker, chief economist of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). “The technology is there for them to work remotely and work very efficiently.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OVqCq2"&gt;The WPA and other New Deal-era programs also showed what the government can do about health care infrastructure when it makes it a priority. Currently, the battle against the coronavirus has not only exhausted hospitals across the country, but underscored a dire need for better contingency planning, as well as expanded testing infrastructure to help Americans get back to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VE9q2j"&gt;&lt;a href="https://nddaily.blogspot.com/2016/12/new-deal-health-projects-20-ways-new.html"&gt;Health care was a cornerstone of the New Deal/WPA program&lt;/a&gt;. One initiative, the National Health Survey, discovered that “some 2 million cases of serious illness go entirely without medical treatment every year.” In response, the WPA maintained and supported clinics, sent nurses to low-income neighborhoods, and built medical and dental facilities across the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPiHU5"&gt;According to Gray Brechin, an author who helps run &lt;a href="https://livingnewdeal.org/"&gt;the Living New Deal&lt;/a&gt;, a website that chronicles the history of these programs, WPA’s success offers an incredibly useful model for today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDnqBq"&gt;“The WPA built hospitals across the country, especially in rural areas,” he says. “The program also vastly increased the staff of nurses. It helped expand the network of orthopedic hospitals, increased access to hydrotherapy clinics for those suffering polio, and even had workers sewing masks, the ’30s equivalent of manufacturing PPE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GoJ5yD"&gt;The scope of the WPA’s accomplishments in the health care field were vast, exemplifying the type of wartime mobilization needed in the fight against the novel coronavirus. Here’s &lt;a href="https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/great-depression/health-conservation-and-the-wpa/"&gt;an excerpt from a 1939 speech&lt;/a&gt; by Florence Kerr, a WPA regional director, that puts its accomplishments into focus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Gyb0qh"&gt;In the first three years of the program, WPA built over 100 new hospitals and improved 1,422. It has provided technical and clerical workers for city health departments. It has organized and helped conduct maternal and child health clinics in hundreds of communities. ... During a three-year period over 3,500,000 people were treated in WPA clinics. Nurses were provided at nearly 900,000 immunizations. Into poor homes trained nurses have been sent by WPA on nearly 5 million visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ouvCzQ"&gt;Brechin said advocates and boosters of the New Deal constantly spoke of “increasing the health of the country in the broadest possible terms,” part of what he calls the “lost ethical language” of the program. Improving health, both physical and economic, was a measuring stick for success. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S33iY1"&gt;Many of those involved in the New Deal came from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_movement"&gt;Settlement House movement&lt;/a&gt; of the early 20th century, a reformist push to help social welfare and provide day care, education, and health care to low-income Americans.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OySynA"&gt;A federal program that paired infrastructure investment with a broad reinvestment into our hospitals, clinics, and rural health centers would come along just as the nation needed work, and was recovering from an era-defining pandemic. It would also provide opportunities for architects and designers to utilize their skills as a form of national service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Yttxz"&gt;“We lost about 30 percent of architecture positions during the Great Recession,” says the AIA’s Baker. “Absolutely, this current crisis will mean fewer positions in firms.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD4rv2"&gt;Think of what all those architects—backed by broad federal support and funding—could do to improve our cities and our neighborhoods. Baker says that one of AIA’s priorities has been &lt;a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2019/11/21/20975754/nyc-buildings-energy-efficiency-letter-grades-climate-mobilization-act"&gt;making older buildings more energy efficient&lt;/a&gt;. Why not get out-of-work architects busy redesigning and upgrading federal facilities and other structures to create more sustainable workplaces that are healthier and more efficient?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAWxur"&gt;“Infrastructure investment has been kicked around for the last four years, when we had labor shortages in construction and not enough architects to hire,” Baker said. “That maybe wasn’t the time for something like this. Today is exactly the right time. There will be cutbacks in design employment, low interest rates mean it’s a great time to take on debt, and we all project increased government investment going forward.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3RcBy"&gt;The ability to tailor hiring to those who need jobs was another strength of the WPA that we should be replicating today, says Sandra Opdycke, a professor at Vassar College and author of &lt;em&gt;The WPA: Creating Jobs and Hope in the Great Depression&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LtaX3O"&gt;“We usually say the worker needs to adapt to the economy,” she says. “During the WPA, they said adapt the economy to the worker.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q73JsM"&gt;That view shouldn’t be limited to architects and those in the engineering and construction industries. Opdycke points to the investment in public arts and murals during the WPA, which employed thousands of artists and painters. Many were hired to produce public service announcements and ad campaigns. Imagine programs to beautify parks and public spaces, or to repair and restore subway platforms or build new and beautiful transit infrastructure, such as bus stations. Public transportation has also suffered greatly during the economic shutdown, and would benefit from an infusion of dollars and design know-how. Another New Deal program, the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC), employed thousands of Americans to develop natural resources; from 1933 to 1942, these workers planted 3 billion trees and helped create 800 parks across the country. &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2019/5/22/18635528/parks-sports-recreation-parkscore-trust-public-land"&gt;Imagine a nationwide effort to make sure every American has green space within walking distance&lt;/a&gt; (currently, a third of city residents lack such access). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJGpni"&gt;“The WPA really focused on projects that were critical and important, and not always things private industry was likely to fund,” says AIA’s Baker. “These things tended to have more social value, and tended to be forward-looking and provide a great benefit to the public and large, even nearly 100 years later.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TVkA9"&gt;Any WPA-style program to overcome the crisis created by the coronavirus pandemic needs to start not just with grand ambition, but with the kind of oversight, accountability, and transparency that were hallmarks of the New Deal era programs, says Myers-Lipton. But a potential program could also make such a comprehensive difference when it comes to jump-starting the economy and making it a better one. Kevin DeGood, director of Infrastructure Policy at the Center for American Progress, &lt;a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2020/03/06/481367/5-infrastructure-principles-fiscal-stimulus-response-coronavirus/"&gt;argues that these investments&lt;/a&gt; can raise wages and address equity and environmental concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoVPE9"&gt;Infrastructure investments could help bring American cities into the 21st century, with new transit, renewable power, and broadband infrastructure; we can make the vision of a more sustainable, self-sufficient, and equitable United States, the core of the Green New Deal, a reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wJPuh"&gt;Rick Jacobs, CEO of Accelerator for America, a partnership among local leaders that’s been formulating blueprints for a national infrastructure plan, says such a coronavirus-focused stimulus bill could help mayors and regional leaders build upon their grassroots knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ixggj8"&gt;“Local government can be the petri dish of innovation,” he says. “&lt;a href="http://t4america.org/2018/04/20/tiger-program-no-name/"&gt;Look at the success of the TIGER grant program&lt;/a&gt;, part of the Recovery Act. That showed the federal government getting involved with the local governments, and finding that the success was in locally driven initiatives.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ir3Xhc"&gt;Think of what we could accomplish. A jobs bill that provides work for millions of Americans who need it, doing the proud work of building the infrastructure the U.S. needs now, in terms of a more robust health care system, as well as what we need in the future. We can finally repair roads, bridges, and water systems. We can create new transit systems and pedestrian- and bike-friendly infrastructure in cities. Amid the government’s failure to grasp the scope of this crisis and engage it head on, we can embark on a visionary plan that invests in the future and shows we can still accomplish incredible, important work as a nation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5TvOS"&gt;The United States could also become more ready for the next crisis, just as the WPA established quick-response teams that helped Americans overcome disasters. In early 1937, floods ravaged communities up and down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, natural disasters called “thousand-year-floods.” WPA programs sent 18,000 workers to the scene in days, according to Opdycke, and in the following weeks, 150,000 workers were helping relief efforts in 11 states. As we ask why the government wasn’t ready for the current disaster, we should be doing all we can to make sure we’re ready for the next one, whatever form it takes.   &lt;/p&gt;
