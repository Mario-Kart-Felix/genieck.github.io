In the U.S., that temperature is between 45 and 75ºF depending on where you are, with many states falling right in the middle of that range.

With the massive amount of energy used across the country to heat and cool homes, a nationwide shift would also foster large cuts to greenhouse gases. The United States Mid-century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization, <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/files/focus/long-term_strategies/application/pdf/us_mid_century_strategy.pdf\">an official document</a> from 2016 laying out how the country would meet the Paris Agreement (before the Trump Administration withdrew the U.S. from the agreement), specifically mentions heat pumps as part of strategies for reducing emissions from buildings. “Geothermal heat pumps use electricity to provide heating, cooling, and water heating to buildings at higher energy efficiency than conventional heating and cooling air conditioning systems,” says Xiaobing Liu, a geothermal heat pump researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. “Even though we still use electricity generated at power plants, geothermal heat pumps can still reduce the emissions related to electricity because of their efficiency.”"},{"_id":"L6HIUWKDAJHKNEQNBTDHQBO2EY","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1583166258045},"content":"Heat pumps may also resolve a critical problem with wind- and solar-based utility systems: the variability of the energy supply caused by fluctuating winds and sunlight.

The most signficant is high costs. In a commercial space, a geothermal system can cost $20.75 per square foot of building space, and Liu estimates the cost for a three-bedroom house is between $9,000 and $15,000. That’s because drilling holes in the ground for the piping is expensive, as is the piping system itself. “It could be double the cost of a conventional system,” says Liu. “That is the biggest barrier.”"},{"_id":"QWURY5GZHBBX7DJ6VRSX2REFF4","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1583166258049},"content":"Additionally, Liu explains there’s a chicken and egg problem due to the small market for ground-source pumps.

And because the market is small, people aren’t investing in its development. “All new technologies always have high costs,” he says, adding that while geothermal heat pumps aren’t new, there’s been very little development on the technology in recent years. “But they become cheaper through improvement.” And there’s the “soft costs” of educating consumers and training contractors about heat pumps."},{"_id":"JVIH6SFVFFDOZPHAC4P2XIDHGU","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1583166258050},"content":"While the movement is still small, a few companies have started to address these issues. Hannun at Dandelion Energy says they’re able to lower the initial costs by essentially combining what were once separate trades—drilling and plumbing—into one. Without a company like Dandelion, a homeowner would have to work with several contractors to do an installation. It’s similar to how solar became cheaper after becoming its own distinct trade, combining roofing and electrician skills to create unified companies that could provide the whole service. Dandelion also offers financing, and Hannun says a typical homeowner in New York pays $135 to $140 a month over 20 years for a geothermal installation, a system that lasts 25 years. In the Northeast, that’s often less than homeowners pay for their heating fuel, so their monthly heating cost lowers after the installation, after which they’re only paying for a small amount of electricity to run the heat pump."},{"_id":"QT4KFUM2BVHTFA6I4SIKUZ5QZM","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1583166258051},"content":"Private utilities companies, which already run underground systems for natural gas, may also have a role to play in the transition to electric heating and cooling.
