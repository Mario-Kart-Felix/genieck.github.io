The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has funded the first phase, which identifies and offers buyouts to the most vulnerable residents in six Gulf-adjacent parishes, where a combination of swelling oceans, erosion, and sinking land (called subsidence) is already eating away at the ground. On Isle de Jean Charles, 80 miles from New Orleans, relocation is already underway under a previous HUD-funded effort, though only about half of residents have opted to move so far. The next (and as-yet-unfunded) phase of the plan will also help those who choose to stay by elevating homes, relocating urban centers, and altering transportation routes to bypass flood-prone areas."},{"_id":"7FI4UMJQXFF2TBLXK6QKW53W2E","type":"raw_html","additional_properties":{"_id":"VDXQH66VDBEAJI6GIXBVEHAOTU","comments":[]},"content":"<p class=\"paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered\"><a href=\"#backtotop\">Back to Top</a></p><p style=\"padding-top: 40px; margin-top: -40px;\" id=\"Maine\"></p>"},{"_id":"T3F4543OT5ESDALOAURBHTH7UI","type":"header","level":2,"additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1582812984763},"content":"MAINE could retrain its lobstermen"},{"_id":"JTTSGRDCVJBNHHV4IRSMZVQL3U","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1582750631566},"content":"In Maine, it’s not fossil-fuel workers who need help, it’s lobstermen, who have watched their catches <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/1831\">migrate north to cooler waters</a>.

Crucially, the act, which received bipartisan support, frames the effort as economic development more than climate action. “There wasn’t a robust discussion of ‘we need to reduce emissions.’ It was ‘we need to lower bills and encourage clean energy,’” says John Tynan, executive director of Conservation Voters of South Carolina. “We have to find a way to advance clean energy that’s characteristically South Carolina.”"},{"_id":"45KAOPDKYRGHHOAYO77TQPIRDI","type":"raw_html","additional_properties":{"_id":"XH3TMDSMNJEFZLH7XCKDOFU7EA","comments":[]},"content":"<p class=\"paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered\"><a href=\"#backtotop\">Back to Top</a></p><p style=\"padding-top: 40px; margin-top: -40px;\" id=\"South Dakota\"></p>"},{"_id":"IBUIPDAP2RHSFP4D5EL35X4RNU","type":"header","level":2,"additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1582812984834},"content":"SOUTH DAKOTA could build out more wind"},{"_id":"SNCIHZEZUJGLNI42O4P2WDCS3A","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1582750631620},"content":"South Dakota takes advantage of some of the windiest conditions in the US and now has sufficient turbines online to produce more than 1,218 megawatts of power—enough for 1.2 million homes.

The <a href=\"http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5116-S2.SL.pdf\">measure</a> calls for Washington, which now <a href=\"https://www.commerce.wa.gov/growing-the-economy/energy/fuel-mix-disclosure/\">gets 10 percent of its power from coal</a>, to ditch fossil fuel by 2025, become carbon-neutral by 2030, and achieve 100 percent clean energy by 2045. Low-income communities get “energy assistance,” meaning that utilities will have to help fund the weatherization of homes and other efficiency improvements, with a goal of aiding 60 percent of eligible customers by 2030 and 90 percent by 2050. The new law also requires that utilities ensure that low-income neighborhoods have the same access to new energy projects, such as wind facilities or electric-vehicle charging stations, as wealthier ones do."},{"_id":"VDRLOYAQHRAADK5RS4EXP4Y5HA","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/photo/resize/G8EEjqNG64RW5yjre_krTQ2-3ng=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bonnier/public/VDRLOYAQHRAADK5RS4EXP4Y5HA.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","keywords":["farm day spring 2016"],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"35949062784_6deaa8f875_o.jpg","originalUrl":"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bonnier.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VDRLOYAQHRAADK5RS4EXP4Y5HA.jpg","owner":"daniel.mcswain@bonniercorp.com","proxyUrl":"/photo/resize/G8EEjqNG64RW5yjre_krTQ2-3ng=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bonnier/public/VDRLOYAQHRAADK5RS4EXP4Y5HA.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"http://thumbor-prod-us-east-1.photo.aws.arc.pub/G8EEjqNG64RW5yjre_krTQ2-3ng=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bonnier/public/VDRLOYAQHRAADK5RS4EXP4Y5HA.jpg","restricted":false,"takenOn":"2016-05-20T16:32:54Z","thumbnailResizeUrl":"http://thumbor-prod-us-east-1.photo.aws.arc.pub/gxWyUzCU_rFO4jMjWJjU2vXhJdE=/300x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bonnier/public/VDRLOYAQHRAADK5RS4EXP4Y5HA.jpg","version":0,"template_id":294,"comments":[],"_id":"E2YJ64BNAFG5XKEK7JVCVYAXQI"},"address":{},"alt_text":"Statewide, Vermont","caption":"Statewide, Vermont has struggled to hit its emissions-reduction targets, but some individuals are already making the switch on their own.","created_date":"2020-02-26T22:52:01Z","credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"byline":"Department of Energy/Flickr (custom credit)","name":"Department of Energy/Flickr","type":"author"}]},"height":718,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2020-02-26T22:52:01Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"bonnier"},"source":{"edit_url":"https://bonnier.arcpublishing.com/photo/VDRLOYAQHRAADK5RS4EXP4Y5HA","system":"photo center"},"status":"","taxonomy":{"associated_tasks":[]},"type":"image","url":"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bonnier.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VDRLOYAQHRAADK5RS4EXP4Y5HA.jpg","version":"0.10.3","width":1920,"syndication":{"external_distribution":"","search":""}},{"_id":"SNYDNY4Y7JELLBB735HAGSN2FI","type":"raw_html","additional_properties":{"_id":"MX4NL7D7HFGFNFN73RZDW3QEXA","comments":[]},"content":"<p class=\"paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered\"><a href=\"#backtotop\">Back to Top</a></p><p style=\"padding-top: 40px; margin-top: -40px;\" id=\"West Virginia\"></p>"},{"_id":"7NUMSKGOCJF4LDQUIKR74NDZ6E","type":"header","level":2,"additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1582812984857},"content":"WEST VIRGINIA could keep miners working"},{"_id":"ZTCQ3IK53RHXLIXZFLTX7KRYEI","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1582750631640},"content":"In West Virginia, where coal is still king, per capita carbon emissions are among the highest in the country, and state and federal lawmakers have resisted climate action at almost every turn.

Governor Mark Gordon has asked lawmakers to commit $10 million for a pilot project that would trap 75 percent of pollution from such facilities. And in March 2019, he signed a bill that further encourages keeping coal plants open by requiring owners to <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/coal-wyoming-lawmakers-extend-lifeline-to-coal-power\">look for new buyers</a> before closing such facilities. Still, the <a href=\"https://windexchange.energy.gov/maps-data/142\">blustery plains</a> have attracted renewable-energy developers—there’s already 1,410 megawatts of wind power up and running—but environmental groups say officials could do far more to harness the GND’s promise of a new energy economy. “It’s all talk and no action,” says Jeremy Nichols, climate-change campaign manager for WildEarth Guardians. Job training and other aid would ensure a soft landing for fossil-fuel workers, “but transition is still a dirty word in Wyoming,” he says."},{"_id":"MIEO7MGJYBCWXDWLIFHZUYCTBY","type":"raw_html","additional_properties":{"_id":"PP4CMGMISJC7FHGUEMSN43MOZA","comments":[]},"content":"<p class=\"paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered\"><a href=\"#backtotop\">Back to Top</a></p>"}],"created_date":"2020-02-26T20:55:49.701Z","revision":{"revision_id":"HY46Z6PXHVF3JHPWA6EXW2G224","parent_id":"TKYU7JJLJ5CSJFPDHD5Z3DTL7Y","editions":["default"],"branch":"default","user_id":"psaha@bonniercorp.local","published":true},"last_updated_date":"2020-02-27T16:33:14.325Z","canonical_url":"/story/environment/green-new-deal-state-by-state/","headlines":{"basic":"What a Green New Deal would look like in every state","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":"","meta_title":""},"owner":{"sponsored":false,"id":"bonnier"},"address":{},"workflow":{"status_code":1},"subheadlines":{"basic":"The most impactful projects for all 50 states—and the planet."},"description":{"basic":"What if the proposed Green New Deal were real?
