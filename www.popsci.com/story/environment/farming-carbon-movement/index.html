As expected, the systems with the least soil disturbance and the most plant life hold more carbon. But smaller insights could lead to new tweaks. For instance, pine and walnut trees are better sinks than cypress and ash (good news for Lanier). Ultimately, Franzluebbers will convert those findings into climate-​conscious recommendations for the sandy plains of eastern North Carolina; similar experiments are running parallel in other regions. “We have to return carbon to the soil,” he says. “We need to move much quicker than we are.” Intrepid farmers aren’t waiting around."},{"_id":"4YBF4WGGT5GKFO67T6EKJJ2CKE","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/photo/resize/BPzLabKrVUiHIY50QMr6XeQ0uss=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bonnier/public/4YBF4WGGT5GKFO67T6EKJJ2CKE.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","keywords":[],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"82-PSCSP20-Feature-CarbonFarm-4.jpg","originalUrl":"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bonnier.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4YBF4WGGT5GKFO67T6EKJJ2CKE.jpg","owner":"daniel.mcswain@bonniercorp.com","proxyUrl":"/photo/resize/BPzLabKrVUiHIY50QMr6XeQ0uss=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bonnier/public/4YBF4WGGT5GKFO67T6EKJJ2CKE.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"http://thumbor-prod-us-east-1.photo.aws.arc.pub/BPzLabKrVUiHIY50QMr6XeQ0uss=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bonnier/public/4YBF4WGGT5GKFO67T6EKJJ2CKE.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"http://thumbor-prod-us-east-1.photo.aws.arc.pub/dedruSTw7Jib14U6sRk9Ot4ylaU=/300x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bonnier/public/4YBF4WGGT5GKFO67T6EKJJ2CKE.jpg","version":0,"template_id":294,"comments":[],"_id":"JRSRKNM6Z5E6JJXDLQZA7VMSQY"},"address":{},"alt_text":"Patrick Leger illustration","caption":"Sowing plants like ryegrasses and radishes between cash crops helps the ground hold onto more carbon.","created_date":"2020-03-30T20:10:30Z","credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"_id":"ZGQIK44NGIQH4KAQOCZEJF3QUY","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Patrick Leger","url":"https://www.fieldandstream.com/authors/patrick-leger","slug":"patrick-leger","additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"ZGQIK44NGIQH4KAQOCZEJF3QUY","type":"author","source_id":"105250","byline":"Patrick Leger","bio_page":"https://www.fieldandstream.com/authors/patrick-leger","name":"Patrick Leger","firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Leger","org":"Field & Stream","slug":"patrick-leger","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2019-01-03T14:08:23.977Z"}}}]},"height":1109,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2020-03-30T20:10:30Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"bonnier"},"source":{"edit_url":"https://bonnier.arcpublishing.com/photo/4YBF4WGGT5GKFO67T6EKJJ2CKE","system":"photo center"},"status":"","taxonomy":{"associated_tasks":[]},"type":"image","url":"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bonnier.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4YBF4WGGT5GKFO67T6EKJJ2CKE.jpg","version":"0.10.3","width":2000,"syndication":{"external_distribution":"","search":""},"subtitle":"Cover crops"},{"_id":"HP2QFVN2BRC5LCFVLYFDVDC7XE","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1585664726163},"content":"<b>On a clear, cold day in early March 2019</b>, Justin Jordan, a fifth-generation grower in Lacona, Iowa, pores over old maps spread across his dining-room table.
