																<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: originally published on April 13, 2020, most recently updated on April 19, 2020</em></p>
<p>What follows is a comprehensive timeline of major U.S. policy events related to the novel coronavirus pandemic. We’ve focused on the U.S. government’s preparation for a pandemic, tracking warning signals of COVID-19, and public and internal responses when the outbreak hit inside the United States.</p>
<p>In our view, the timeline is clear: Like previous administrations, the Trump administration knew for years that a pandemic of this gravity was possible and imminently plausible. Several Trump administration officials raised strong concerns prior to the emergence of COVID-19 and raised alarms once the virus appeared within the United States. While some measures were put in place to prepare the United States for pandemic readiness, many more were dismantled since 2017.</p>
<p>In response to COVID-19, the United States was slow to act at a time when each day of inaction mattered most&#8211;in terms of both the eventual public health harms as well as the severe economic costs. The President and some of his closest senior officials also disseminated misinformation that left the public less safe and more vulnerable to discounting the severity of the pandemic. When it came time to minimize the loss of life and economic damage, the United States was unnecessarily underprepared, had sacrificed valuable time, and confronted the pandemic with a more mild response than public health experts recommended. These lapses meant that the United States was ultimately forced to make more drastic <i>economic</i> sacrifices to catch up to the severity of the pandemic than would have otherwise been necessary.</p>
<p>Readers can reach their own conclusions based on these publicly available facts. If we have missed any key information, please notify us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:lte@justsecurity.org">lte@justsecurity.org</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>TIMELINE</b></p>
<p><b>Friday, Jan. 13, 2017</b><b>: The joint Obama-Trump transition teams run an exercise for pandemic preparedness.  </b></p>
<p>The outgoing Obama team runs the Trump transition team through a series of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-inauguration-warning-scenario-pandemic-132797">pandemic-scenarios</a>. The transition documents, <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000170-e50c-d588-ab77-ed5ff3310000">obtained by POLITICO</a>, show that the purpose of the exercise is to familiarize the incoming team with “domestic incident management policy and practices” in the face of major crises.</p>
<p>Key takeaways from the exercise include: (1) a collective understanding of the science and the disease must drive response decisions; (2) days and even hours are paramount in order to build as much lead time as possible; (3) a coordinated and unified national response and message is necessary; and (4) “medical countermeasure strategy is key for success,” including social distancing and addressing shortages in ventilators and personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>Trump administration attendees <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/16/readout-principal-level-transition-exercise">include</a>: Steven Mnuchin, Rep. Mike Pompeo, Wilbur Ross, Betsy DeVos, Dr. Ben Carson, Elaine Chao, Stephen Miller, Marc Short, Reince Priebus (<i>resigned</i>), Rex Tillerson (<i>fired</i>), Gen. James Mattis (<i>fired</i>), Rep. Ryan Zinke (<i>resigned</i>), Sen. Jeff Sessions (<i>resigned</i>), Sen. Dan Coats (<i>fired</i>), Andrew Puzder (<i>not confirmed</i>), Dr. Tom Price (<i>resigned</i>), Gov. Rick Perry (<i>resigned</i>), Dr. David Shulkin (<i>fired</i>), Gen. John Kelly (<i>resigned</i>), Rep. Mick Mulvaney, Linda McMahon (<i>resigned</i>), Sean Spicer (<i>fired</i>), Joe Hagin (<i>resigned</i>), Joshua Pitcock (<i>resigned</i>), Tom Bossert (<i>fired</i>), KT McFarland (<i>resigned</i>), Gen. Michael Flynn (<i>awaiting criminal sentencing</i>), Gary Cohn (<i>resigned</i>), Katie Walsh (<i>resigned</i>), and Rick Dearborn (<i>resigned</i>).</p>

<p><b>March-May 2017: President Trump </b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/16/us/politics/trump-budget-cuts.html"><b>proposes</b></a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/28/us/politics/biosecurity-trump-budget-defense.html"><b>cutting over $277 million</b></a><b> in pandemic-preparedness funding. Congress, in bipartisan action, rejects the funding cuts. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump proposes cutting $136 million from the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response (responsible for tracking outbreaks of disease), $65 million from the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (a center that fights emerging infectious diseases), and $76 million from the CDCs Center for Global Health (a center dedicated to fighting international health threats). </span></p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/28/us/politics/biosecurity-trump-budget-defense.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With bipartisan support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Congress </span><a href="https://apnews.com/d36d6c4de29f4d04beda3db00cb46104"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the funding cuts. “Cutting the Centers for Disease Control, I think, leaves you very vulnerable and the American people very vulnerable,” Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK) states in a House budget hearing. “Sometime in the president’s term, you will have a pandemic.”</span></b></p>
<p><b>May 11, 2017</b><b>: The Intelligence Community’s Worldwide Threat Assessment warns of major pandemic risks.</b></p>
<p>In written testimony before Congress on the presentation of the Intelligence Community’s Worldwide Threat Assessment, the Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats  <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Testimonies/SSCI%20Unclassified%20SFR%20-%20Final.pdf">writes</a>, “A novel or reemerging microbe that is easily transmissible between humans and is highly pathogenic remains a major threat because such an organism has the potential to spread rapidly and kill millions.”</p>
<p><b>September 2017: The Trump administration contracts with a company to create a prototype of a reusable (rather than one-time use) N95 mask. </b></p>
<p>The administration <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/federal-government-spent-millions-to-ramp-up-mask-readiness-but-that-isnt-helping-now/2020/04/03/d62dda5c-74fa-11ea-a9bd-9f8b593300d0_story.html">contracts</a> with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque to create a prototype of this next-generation respirator. The prototype development phase is for 15 months, but is subsequently extended.</p>
<p><b>December 2017</b><b>: The Trump administration reportedly bans the CDC from using the terms “evidence-based” and “science-based.”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump administration </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cdc-gets-list-of-forbidden-words-fetus-transgender-diversity/2017/12/15/f503837a-e1cf-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">instructs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> senior officials at the CDC that they should not use the phrases “science-based” or “evidence-based” and instead use the suggested phrase: “CDC bases its recommendations on science in consideration with community standards and wishes.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Health and Human Services </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/health/cdc-trump-banned-words.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">denies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the report stating: “The assertion that H.H.S. has ‘banned words’ is a complete mischaracterization of discussions regarding the budget formulation process. H.H.S. will continue to use the best scientific evidence available to improve the health of all Americans. H.H.S. also strongly encourages the use of outcome and evidence data in program evaluations and budget decisions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/health/cdc-trump-banned-words.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> some of the details, but says it is unclear whether the ban is limited to CDC budget documents.</span></p>
<p><b>February 9, 2018</b><b>: President Trump signs bill that cuts $1.35 billion in funding for Prevention and Public Health Fund at the CDC.</b></p>
<p>President Trump <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-will-cdc-cuts-affect-health-programs-abroad-and-at-home">cuts</a> $1.35 billion of funding for the CDC’s <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/open/prevention/index.html">Prevention and Public Health Fund</a>, established in 2016 as part of the Affordable Care Act. The fund supports programs that monitor healthcare associated infections, programs that are responsive to rapidly emerging health issues, and programs that improve public health immunization infrastructure, among other things.</p>
<p><b>February 13, 2018</b><b>: The Intelligence Community’s Worldwide Threat Assessment warns of major pandemic risks.</b></p>
<p>In written testimony before Congress on the presentation of the Intelligence Community’s Worldwide Threat Assessment, the Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Testimonies/2018-ATA---Unclassified-SSCI.pdf">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The increase in frequency and diversity of reported disease outbreaks—such as dengue and Zika—probably will continue through 2018, including the potential for a severe global health emergency that could lead to major economic and societal disruptions, strain governmental and international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support. A novel strain of a virulent microbe that is easily transmissible between humans continues to be a major threat, with pathogens such as H5N1 and H7N9 influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus having pandemic potential if they were to acquire efficient human-to-human transmissibility.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>April 9, 2018</b><b>: John Bolton starts his first day as National Security Adviser.</b></p>
<p>John Bolton <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/09/syria-looms-over-john-bolton-first-day-as-trump-national-security-advisor.html">replaces</a> H.R. McMaster as President Trump’s National Security Adviser.</p>
<p><b>April 10, 2018</b><b>: Bolton fires Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert.</b></p>
<p>Early in the  morning, Bolton informs Tom Bossertthat he is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/tom-bossert-trump-s-homeland-security-adviser-resign-n864321">fired</a>. As White House Homeland Security Advisor Bossert “had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks,” reports the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/05/10/top-white-house-official-in-charge-of-pandemic-response-exits-abruptly/">Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p><b>May 7, 2018</b><b>: White House proposes cutting global health budget.</b></p>
<p>The White House sends a plan to Congress proposing budget cuts. It includes cutting out <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/05/10/top-white-house-official-in-charge-of-pandemic-response-exits-abruptly/">$252 million</a> for health security preparedness  in funds remaining from the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic.</p>
<p><b>May 7, 2018</b><b>: The National Security Council’s director of medical and biodefense preparedness warns that pandemic flu is the top health security concern and that the country is not prepared for it.</b></p>
<p>Luciana Borio, NSC director of medical and biodefense preparedness, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/05/10/top-white-house-official-in-charge-of-pandemic-response-exits-abruptly/">states</a>, “The threat of pandemic flu is the <b>number one health security concern</b>. Are we ready to respond? I fear the answer is no.” Borio’s statement is part of her remarks at a symposium at Emory University to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic.</p>
<p><b>May 8, 2018</b>: <b>The National Security Council removes the top official responsible for pandemic response and disbands the global health security team. </b></p>
<p>President Trump’s National Security Advisor, John Bolton, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/05/10/top-white-house-official-in-charge-of-pandemic-response-exits-abruptly/">removes</a> Rear Adm.

Previously, Ziemer was the sole senior official focused on pandemic preparedness. He is not replaced.</p>
<p><b>May 15, 2018: Two members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee </b><a href="https://connolly.house.gov/uploadedfiles/connolly_bera_letter_to_nsa_john_bolton_on_global_health_security.pdf"><b>write</b></a><b> to John Bolton, President Trump’s National Security Advisor, to express their concern over the recent actions “taken to downgrade the importance of global health security.” </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressmen Gerald Connolly (D-VA) and Dr. Ami Bera (D-CA) write to John Bolton,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and head of the National Security Council, “to express the deep concerns with several recent actions the White House has taken to downgrade the importance of global health security.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><b>We fear these recent decisions will leave the United States vulnerable to pandemics and commit us to a strategy of triage should one occur</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” state the congressmen, citing Rear Admiral Timothy Ziemer’s departure from the NSC, the elimination of Ziemer’s global health team at the NSC, and the president’s proposed funding cuts to Ebola pandemic-preparedness programs.  They urge Bolton to reconsider the demotion of the “global health security portfolio and reject the proposal to rescind Ebola contingency funds.”</span></p>
<p><b>May 18, 2018: Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio sends the president a </b><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sherrod-brown-letter-president-trump-WH-Global-Health-Security-5.18.18.pdf"><b>letter</b></a><b> saying the decision to cut funding for global health programs and disband the global health team at the National Security Council could cost American lives. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Sherrod Brown, a moderate Democrat from Ohio, writes to President Trump expressing his concern over Rear Admiral Timothy Ziemer’s departure from the NSC, the elimination of Ziemer’s global health team at the NSC, and the president’s proposed funding cuts for pandemic-preparedness programs. Sen. Brown urges the president: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In our globalized world, where diseases are never more than a plane ride away, we must do all we can to prepare for the next, inevitable outbreak and keep Americans safe from disease. I urge you to act swiftly in reaffirming your commitment to global health security by taking immediate action to designate senior level NSC personnel to focus on global health security, supporting adequate and appropriate funding for global health security initiatives, and leading the way in preparing for the next pandemic threat.” </span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>September 2018</b><b>: The Department of Health and Human Services diverts funding from the CDC to pay for housing detained immigrant children.</b></p>
<p>HHS Secretary Alex Azar <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-immigrant-children-detention-hhs-cuts-funds-programs-like-cancer-research-230259583.html">reallocates</a> $266 million of funds from the CDC to the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) program in the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).</p>
<p><b>The same month</b><b>: The Trump administration fails to follow through with an Obama-era project designed to protect against medical supply shortages during pandemics.</b></p>
<p>The Trump administration Department of Health and Human Services receives detailed plans by a medical manufacturer to create a new machine that would have the capacity to make protective masks at high speed (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/federal-government-spent-millions-to-ramp-up-mask-readiness-but-that-isnt-helping-now/2020/04/03/d62dda5c-74fa-11ea-a9bd-9f8b593300d0_story.html">1.5 million masks per day</a>). The machine was specifically designed to handle pandemic-related medical shortages and was the culmination of an Obama-era preparedness plan. The Trump Administration paid millions of dollars to the company but does not follow through with making the machine.</p>
<p><b>September 18, 2018</b><b>: President Trump issues a Presidential Memorandum and National Biodefense Strategy designed to ensure a comprehensive and coordinated approach to biological incidents. </b></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-support-national-biodefense/">memorandum</a> establishes a Biodefense Steering Committee, which is chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and includes the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The memo also directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Alex Azar) to create a Biodefense Coordination Team and that the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (then John Bolton) will serve as the lead for policy coordination and review.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Biodefense-Strategy.pdf">National Biodefense Strategy</a> outlines a high-level roadmap of the U.S. response to biological threats and incidents..

I think everyone in this room probably shares that concern, and working with Secretary Leavitt, President Bush and the Congress to create the pandemic flu preparedness work that we did that really helped rejuvenate a domestic annual flu vaccine capability here in the United States revolutionized, we’re not there yet, but revolutionized our capabilities and capacities around flu production in the U.S., to minimize shortages so we hopefully never go through what we did in 04 on the Chiron shortage, and then [sic] now we]ve got capacity, but we still need to improve our speed of production of pan flu vaccine and our capacities.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>July 2019</b><b>:</b> <b>The Trump administration eliminates an American public health position designed to detect disease outbreaks in China. </b></p>

The official, Dr. Linda Quick, worked with  Chinese epidemiologists to help detect and contain diseases. “If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster,” Bao-Ping Zhu, who served in the role between 2007 and 2011, tells <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv/exclusive-u-s-axed-cdc-expert-job-in-china-months-before-virus-outbreak-idUSKBN21910S">Reuters</a> in March 2020. Thomas R. Frieden, former director of the CDC, said that if the Quick had still been in China, “it is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.” However, Scott McNabb, a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and now a research professor at Emory University says, “it probably wouldn’t have made a big difference.” “The problem was how the Chinese handled it,” he says.</p>
<p>No disease expert replaced Quick in the program following her departure.</p>
<p>“The decision to eliminate Quick’s job came as the <b>CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years</b>,” Reuters reports.</p>

<p>“The United States is unprepared to deliver a sufficient number of vaccine doses quickly enough to stop the rapid initial spread of a pandemic virus,” the CEA reports. “Pandemic influenza is a low-probability but high-cost problem that should not be ignored.

This could lead to tremendous, avoidable costs.”</p>

The latter includes political and security risk, socioeconomic resilience, the adequacy of infrastructure, environmental risks, and public health vulnerabilities that may inhibit a country&#8217;s ability to prevent or respond to an epidemic or pandemic. </span></p>
<p><b>November 17, 2019</b><b>: Possible first case of COVID-19 emerges in Hubei province, China.</b></p>
<p>Internal Chinese government data, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3074991/coronavirus-chinas-first-confirmed-covid-19-case-traced-back">obtained</a> by the South China Morning Post (in March), show that Chinese government investigators found an earlier case of COVID-19 on November 17. It is not clear that Chinese authorities knew that they were dealing with a new virus at the time.</p>
<p>“Some of the cases were likely backdated after health authorities had tested specimens taken from suspected patients,” the newspaper reports. “Interviews with whistle-blowers from the medical community suggest Chinese doctors only realised they were dealing with a new disease in late December.” From the 55-year-old patient on November 17 onwards, one to five new cases of COVID-19 are reported each day, according to the government records.</p>
<p>Note: A <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext">report</a> in <i>The Lancet</i> by Chinese doctors from Wuhan’s Jin Yin-tan Hospital refers to the first patient in the study occuring on Dec. 1, 2019.</p>
<p><b>Late November-December 2019</b><b>: U.S. intelligence agencies warn of a “cataclysmic” and “out-of-control” disease in Wuhan, China. </b></p>
<p>The Pentagon’s National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) circulates a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/intelligence-report-warned-coronavirus-crisis-early-november-sources/story?id=70031273">report</a> identifying a contagion sweeping through Wuhan, China. NCMI bases its report on wire intercepts, computer intercepts, and satellite images. “Analysts concluded it could be a cataclysmic event,” a source tells ABC News (in April 2020).</p>
<p>Intelligence community bulletins begin circulating across the government around Thanksgiving. “<b>Those analyses said China’s leadership knew the epidemic was out of control even as it kept such crucial information from foreign governments</b> and public health agencies,” ABC News reports.</p>
<p>The intelligence reports raise alarms inside the US government because the disease could pose a serious threat to U.S. forces in Asia.</p>
<p>In response to ABC News and other reports in April 2020, the Pentagon issues a denial. “We can confirm that media reporting about the existence/release of a National Center for Medical Intelligence Coronavirus-related product/assessment in November of 2019 is not correct. No such NCMI product exists,” Col. R. Shane Day, Director of the NCMI, says in a statement provided by the Department of Defense.</p>

He concludes, “I think the simplest answer is that the ABC report is simply wrong. Not in its totality necessarily but in dating the original report back to late November. If it’s a month later that starts to look plausible.” (The New York Times later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html">reports</a> that the NCMI concluded that the virus was likely to spread across the globe and could become a pandemic, but without a date as to that assessment except that it occured by early January.)</p>

Right now the risk is still low, but this could change. I’ve said that many times even on this program. You’ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don’t need to change anything you’re doing.

<p><b>Fauci</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “You know, it ends if you &#8212; it depends on the nature of the outbreak. I mean, this could be a major outbreak. I hope not. Or it could be something that’s reasonably well controlled. At the end of the day, this will ultimately go down. Hopefully we could protect the American public from any serious degree of morbidity or mortality. That’s the reason why we’ve got to do the things that we have in our plan.”</span></p></blockquote>

<p>In a prime time Oval Office address to the nation, President Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-address-nation/">announces</a> new travel restrictions to and from 26 European countries, says that the United States has taken early intense action, and commends the “dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe.” The travel restrictions do not apply to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/12/815097880/u-k-not-included-in-trumps-european-travel-ban-even-as-covid-19-spreads-there">United Kingdom</a>, even though the country has <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-s-uk-exemption-travel-restrictions-raises-eyebrows-n1156436">among the highest numbers</a> of reported cases in the region.

I don’t see it, but I’m hoping there is something I don’t know.” James Lawler (professor of internal medicine) replies, “Fuck no. This is the absolute wrong move.” Richard Hatchett (CEO of Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) chimes in, “No justification that I can see.”</p>
<p>Dr. Eva Lee responds, “I was hoping he would mention about schools, government and private sector tele-work, community gatherings, things that really need everyone to actively engage in. And also extra resources for healthcare providers. We really need to protect providers who care for covid-19 patients.”</p>

They really — they missed the call. They could have called it months earlier.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He continues: &#8220;One of the most dangerous and costly decisions from the WHO was its disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other nations. They were very much opposed to what we did. Fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China, saving untold numbers of lives. Thousands and thousands of people would have died. Had other nations likewise suspended travel from China countless lives would have been saved. &#8230; The reality is that the WHO failed to adequately obtain, vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion. &#8230; The WHO has not addressed a single one of these concerns nor provided an explanation that acknowledges its own mistakes, of which there were many. &#8230;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It would have been so easy to be truthful and so much death has been caused by their mistakes”</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will continue to engage with the WHO to see it can make meaningful reforms. For the time being, we will redirect global health &#8230; and we&#8217;ll be discussing with other countries and influential global health partners what we do with all that money that goes to the WHO.”</span></p>
